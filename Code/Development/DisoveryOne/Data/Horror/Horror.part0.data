     THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/6/90


     FADE IN:


A1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1

     A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
     endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy."
     They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they
     pompously begin their umpteenth verse,
     THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
     the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
     weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF

     where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
     PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
     gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
     over the edge.

     AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE


     BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN.


                                               DISSOLVE TO:


1    INT. DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN O'CLOCK A.M.                      1


     C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --

     The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
     HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour.
     In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
     MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet
     and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage.
     One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward
     seven o'clock.



     IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
     MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and
     down.
     Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
     where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine.
     The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL
     LURCH appears and begins sweeping.
     Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the
     full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back
     of the clock.
     Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall.

     He runs past a couple of doors, past a pair of LEGS in
     pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt
     and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of
     the pajama bottoms. They belong to GOMEZ, who stands
     in the doorway to

A2   INT. FESTER'S ROOM                                         A2

     Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas.
     Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar.
     Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment,
     he radiates unfathomable woe.

                              GOMEZ

                Think of it, Thing. He's been gone
                for twenty-five years. For twenty-
                five years we've attempted to
                contact Fester in the great
                beyond...
     The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine
     to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the
     doorway.
     The room has remained untouched since Fester's
     disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust
     and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth
     - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports
     trophies, a high school photo with all the other students
     keeping as much distance from Fester as possible.
     As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:

                              GOMEZ

                ... And for twenty-five years,
                nothing. Not a whisper, not a
                clue. I'm beginning to think my
                my brother truly is lost.
     Gomez sighs.   Thing TUGS at his cuff, pulling him towards
     the

B2   INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME                                   B2

     Galloping ahead of Gomez, Thing leaps onto an
     old-fashioned door latch and the door swings open INTO

2    INT. GOMEZ AND MORTICIA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME              2

     Gomez approaches the bed.   Asleep on scarlet satin sheets
     is...

     MORTICIA

                      (gazing at Morticia)
               Look at her -- I would die for her.
               I would kill for her. Either way
               -- what bliss.
     Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles
     are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
     offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair
     is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry
     and remote, she's a ruined beauty.
     Morticia OPENS HER EYES.

                             GOMEZ

                      (adoringly)
               Unhappy, darling?

                             MORTICIA

                      (passionately)
               Oh, yes, yes. Completely.

     Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized
     chemistry set.
     The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's
     collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!",
     "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!"
     SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked
     in the corner.



     In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING

     FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA.

     This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
     every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
     parents would be proud of.
     He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin-
     ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down.
     He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma-
     tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he
     crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

     Solemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black
     hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool
     among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A

     STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR.

     The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head
     through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in
     the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in.
     Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string.

                             WEDNESDAY

               Thank you, Grandmama.
     In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic.




                             GRANNY

               You kids are going to have to kill
               your own breakfast this morning.
     Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted
     human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a
     collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in
     the box.

     Gomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly
     drapes herself across his chest, she is caught in a
     sudden shaft of sunlight. She squints. On the bedside
     table beside her, Morticia's OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS

     ORCHID WILTS.





                             MORTICIA

               Gomez... the sun... il me perce
               comme un poignard.

                             GOMEZ

     He kisses his way up to her neck, then, suddenly
     bursting with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose, LEAPS
     from the bed, drawing his bedside saber from its sheath
     and BRANDISHING it at the offending beam.

                            GOMEZ

              En garde monsieur sole!
     He thrusts and parries, pantomiming a duel with the
     shaft of light.

                            MORTICIA

              Gomez?

              Querida?

                            MORTICIA

              Last night, you were... unhinged.
              You were like some desperate,
              howling demon. You frightened me.
              Do it again.

      TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET,
      approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of
      its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and
      Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be
      startled by "Gate."
      Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered
      grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent.
      High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap-
      pointed in Tully than he is in himself.
      Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes
      through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the

      Morticia is looking for her children. She discovers
      Pugsley ASLEEP, curled up on the SILVER PLATTER WHERE THE
      TWO-HEADED PIG LAY. She finds this enchanting.
      Gomez enters.   Morticia shushes him; she points to the
      platter.

                             MORTICIA

                      (whispering)
               Look - our little boy.

               So sweet. He looks just... like
               a little entree.
      Pugsley wakes up; he looks around.

               Not since before the Mamushka.

      Gomez rallies the family for the search. Morticia wears
      a black cloak. Granny has grabbed her divining rod.
      Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting
      instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map
      of the area.

                             GOMEZ

               Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung
               heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow
               graves. I'll take the abyss, and
               Lurch - check the bottomless pit.

               Up here.
      They look up at Fester, looking down at them from
      Wednesday's window.

                             GOMEZ

               Fester! You take the ravine!     And
               the unmarked, abandoned well!

      Thing tugs at the cuff of Gomez's pants.       Gomez nods.

                                GOMEZ

                  That's the spirit, Thing - lend a

      They all sweep off, with Gomez in the lead.

      Fester is still at the window.      Abigail joins him.

      TULLY -




      sitting in an armchair, basking in the rays of sunshine
      that beam from a copy of "The Sun Also Rises." Tully
      smiles at them.

       Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the
       cemetery. Two proud marble vultures guard the entryway.
       Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and
       the stone doors slide open. He steps into -

       Inside it is catacomb-like, filled with the bleached
       bones of the Addams dead. Gomez's torch casts shadows
       -- one of which belongs to Wednesday, curled asleep on a
       stone sarcophagus. Relieved to find her, Gomez
       approaches quietly. He doesn't want to wake her up. He
       lifts her tenderly in his arms.

      Gate can't open. He rattles miserably on his hinges --
      locked tight with heavy chains and yellow police tape -
      large "NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!! ADDAMS FAMILY -
      KEEP OUT!!" signs are posted on Gate's rusty bars.

      hurries down the walkway, waving his legal document.

                               TULLY

                 This is a restraining order, Gomez.

                               GOMEZ

                 A restraining order?

                               TULLY

                 It requires you to keep a distance of
                 one thousand yards from this house.
                 You've got about nine hundred and
                 ninety-nine yards to go - catch my

                 Not your house, moustache! Not any
                 more! It belongs to the eldest living
                 descendant, the older of the brothers

      GOMEZ

      already sits in the passenger seat of the Duesenberg, his
      coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid,
      his head thrown back.
      Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny
      carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie
      Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots
      his favorite tree and joins the procession. Thing follows,
      dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings, his glove.

      Morticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer,

      Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork.

      As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow

      plastic and orange shag carpet.

      GOMEZ

      sits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga-
      hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has
      been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back

      worried look.

      comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel
      soap.

       Wednesday and Pugsley are at their lemonade stand. They
       are negotiating with a PRISSY LITTLE GIRL IN A GIRL SCOUT
       UNIFORM. The girl scout carries several boxes of Girl
       Scout cookies.

                       (with grave doubts)
                Is this made from real lemons?

       White clapboard. Geraniums in the flower boxes.
       Surrounded by a white picket fence.



       Carrying his SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER AND BUCKET, the tools of
       his new trade, Lurch carefully opens the little white gate.

       AT THE DOOR,

       he rings the doorbell, afraid he might break something.
       A BLONDE HOUSEWIFE in tennis whites, obviously in a hurry,
       opens the door -- only to be greeted by a BUCKETFUL OF
       SLOP thrown past her, onto her peach Oriental rug. She
       SCREAMS in horror, turns to challenge the perpetrator of
       this atrocity and, seeing Lurch, SCREAMS again.
       In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like
       the salesman's manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his
       foot in the way. The door partially RIPS off its hinges.
       Lurch steps inside and shuts the door as best he can.
       A moment passes. The door swings open and Lurch exits,
       jauntily waving a check.

                          dabbing her eye with
                          a fingertip)
                  Look - I'm weeping.
        Abigail exits. The minute the door shuts, Fester gets
        out of bed. He is fully clothed. He goes to the window,
        and begins to climb out.

        Morticia, fully dressed, wearing her cloak, heads off
        down the walk. Unseen by her, Thing trails after.

        Morticia, just outside Gate, struggles to get it open,
        Thing clutching the bars, also attempting to block her
        way.

                                MORTICIA

                  Stop it, you two.
        Morticia breaks free of Thing.

        the sight of Morticia on the stoop.

                                MORTICIA

                  I would like to speak with Fester.
        Tully steps aside.

                                TULLY

                  We've been expecting you...
        Morticia crosses the threshold.

155   EXT. INTERSECTION AT THE FOOT OF THE ADDAMS HILL - NIGHT 155

      Thing does his damnedest to flag down any of the few
      oncoming cars. He waves to no avail, DANCES AROUND in
      frustration, then tries HITCHHIKING, sticking out his
      thumb. A passing car splashes him with mud.
      Screwing up his courage, in a kamikaze leap, he GRABS
      ahold of the bumper of the next car that comes along and
      hangs on for dear life as the car SPEEDS down the street.

      Morticia is now stretched out on the torture RACK. Fester
      and Tully are securing her hands and feet, under Abigail's
      supervision. Fester seems torn, agitated, upset.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Abigail, graciously)
               You are a desperate woman, consumed
               by greed and infinite bitterness.
                      (a beat)
               We could have been such friends.

                             ABIGAIL

               I don't think so. The vault,
               Mrs. Addams - any thoughts?

                      (sweetly, to Abigail)
               Despite everything, I don't hate
               you. I pity you. Persecution,
               fiendish torture, inhuman depravity -
               sometimes it's just not enough.

                             ABIGAIL

               Gordon - let's get started.

                             FESTER

               But, Mother...

               I'm not stalling! Stop badgering me!

                             TULLY

               I'd love to, you know that, but -
               I've got this stomach thing. When I
               torture people. It's just me.

                                ABIGAIL

               Do it!

               Where's your bathroom?




                               ABIGAIL


               NOW!

      Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's
      bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She
      MOANS, rather sensually.

                               ABIGAIL

               Again!
      Tully tightens the rack again. More BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS again, even more orgasmically.

                               ABIGAIL

               Tighter!
      Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes.
      She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Tully, flirtatiously)
               You've done this before.

      Thing leaps dramatically onto the porch, then stops dead
      to knock on the cabin door.
      After a beat:

                                GOMEZ (O.S.)

               Who is it?     We're paid through
               Thursday.
      He opens the door.    Thing rushes in.

      Frustrated, Thing grabs a SPOON and begins tapping out

      MORSE CODE.

                        (to Gomez)
                 A day alone - only that would be
                 death.
      Gomez kisses Morticia's hand.

                                 ABIGAIL

                 Knock it off!    The vault, Addams -
                 right now!

                               FESTER

                 But, Mother can't we...
      Gomez reaches for the book that will open the secret
      panel:

                               ABIGAIL

                 Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your
                 feet! You disgust me - you're nothing
                 but a useless, snivelling baby! A
                 stone around my neck! What was I
                 thinking - I should've left you where
                 I found you!
      At Abigail's final words, Fester suddenly LEAPS FORWARD.

                               FESTER

                 No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong
                 book!

      CLOSE UP

      Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester
      stops him from pulling it.




                                 FESTER

                 Allow me...
      Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's
      about to do.

                               GOMEZ

                        (murmuring)
                 Good show, old man...
      Fester reaches for a DIFFERENT BOOK -- "Hurricane Irene:
      Nightmare from Above."
      Seeing the title of the book, Tully suddenly panics:

               Oh, really?

                             TULLY

               I'm your friend, Gordon - think
               of the doubloons!

                             FESTER

               They're not yours, Tully!     Back off!



      ANGLE on Gomez, releasing Morticia from the torture wheel.

                             MORTICIA

               Quickly, my darling!
      He helps her down from the wheel.

                             GOMEZ

               Leather straps, red-hot pokers...

                             MORTICIA

               Later, my dearest.
      ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.

                             ABIGAIL

               Keep the book closed, Gordon -
               listen to mother!

                             FESTER

               I'll never listen to you - not

                             ABIGAIL

               I had to be strict with you -
               because I cared! Put it down!

                             FESTER

               You never really loved me!
      ANGLE on Gomez and Morticia, nearing the bookcase.

                             GOMEZ

               Come, my love - to safety!

                 You're a terrible mother!   There,
                 I said it!
       Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window.
       Then he blasts Abigail out as well.
       ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed",
       to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading
       Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the
       bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale
       force winds.

                               GOMEZ

                        (calling out to Fester)
                 Old man! This way!
       ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the
       floor toward the bookshelf. Thing fights the wind,
       which pelts him with papers and other flying debris.
       Gomez can no longer fight the storm, and the bookshelf
       slams shut. Fester desperately tries to close the book to
       quell the storm, but a HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ZAPS HIM.
       He falls to the floor, with electricity coursing through
       him.



       MOVE IN on the storm raging within the pages of the book,
       then -

174   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION, NEXT OCTOBER - NIGHT                174

      A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There
      is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN
      OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional
      Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton,
      etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle
      and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and
      he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the
      children CHANT:

                             CHILDREN

               Trick or...
      They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened
      the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM
      IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.




                                                  CUT TO:

175   INT. FRONT HALL - SAME TIME                               175

      Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled.
      The family is busily decorating the house for their annual
      Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant
      yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
      chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o-
      lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from
      the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are
      clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
      cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters
      and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe
      paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each
      holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and
      the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans
      against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat.
      A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the
      letters drip with blood.
      Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony.   Morticia hands
      him a decoration.
      Granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.

                             GRANNY

               Well, it's their loss. I even
               made finger sandwiches.
      Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear.

                             FESTER

                      (petting Thing)
               Oh, calm down.

                               PUGSLEY (O.S.)

               Here we come!



      Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday
      is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as
      a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND
      GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down
      onto his feet.

                             GOMEZ

               Pugsley, old man!

               Look at you.

                      (to Uncle Fester)
               How do you like it?
      Fester is very touched; he picks Pugsley up.

      Everyone starts to move toward the den. There is a KNOCK
      on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the door.
      Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is
      dressed as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin
      It wears a cowboy hat, a bandanna and a holster. Margaret
      is radiant, obviously very much in love.

                             MARGARET

               Hello, Margaret. Cousin It - I
               almost didn't recognize you.

                             MARGARET

               Isn't he handsome? Everyone keeps
               asking where he bought his costume.

                             GOMEZ

                      (admiringly)
               It is a wonderful hat.

                      (solemnly)
               This is my costume. I'm a homicidal
               maniac. They look just like everyone
               else.

      Fester and Pugsley are posed at one end of the room.
      Lurch has set up an easel and canvas; he is painting
      Fester and Pugsley's portrait.
      Gomez and Wednesday are sitting on the floor amid
      newspapers, carving a pumpkin.
      Morticia is knitting. Margaret and Cousin It sit together,
      holding hands. Granny brings people cups of steaming
      punch, from a punch bowl.

               Halloween - it's such a special
               time. Ghosts and goblins. Witches
               on broomsticks.

               Children begging in the streets.

               Now that I've got my memory back.

               For the picture?
      Fester pops a light bulb into his mouth.   It lights.
      Pugsley giggles.
      Gomez stands up, having finished the pumpkin. He places
      it on a table, and lights the candle inside. The pumpkin
      glows. It has ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD.
      Everyone oohs and ahhs.

               You know, all the old sayings are
               true. There's no place like home.
               And blood is thicker than water.

               All right, everybody - time for a
               game! What shall it be - bobbing
               for apples?

      Everyone starts to exit, chattering happily.

               Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?

                               WEDNESDAY

               No, mine!

                             FESTER

                      (to Wednesday)
               I tell you what - we'll give you a
               head start. Three skulls and a
               pelvis - how's that?
      Pugsley and Wednesday cheer and run out.   Fester faces
      Gomez.




                             FESTER

               My own dear brother - who could be
               more precious?

                       brothers devotion)
               And just as refreshing.
      Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly
      handshake.

                             GOMEZ

               Let us never be parted.

               Let us always be as one.



      Fester flips Gomez in a JUDO FLIP.
      Gomez LANDS -
      At the foot of a glass display case. The camera pans up
      the case. It contains ABIGAIL AND TULLY, EXPERTLY

      MOUNTED AND STUFFED.

      Fester rises, dusting himself off.

      Everyone is gone. Morticia and Gomez have drifted into
      the front hall; they are moving toward the front door.

                              MORTICIA

                       (deeply satisfied)
                Our family... what are they?

                Oh, Tish - what a night. Everyone
                -- together at last. What more

      Morticia and Gomez are silhouetted in the doorway. There
      is a FULL MOON. In the distance, a wolf HOWLS. Wispy
      GHOSTS flit through the night sky. A human SCREAM is
      heard, followed by Granny's CACKLE. In the cemetery,
      torches are seen, like fireflies.

                         REVISED 10/07/08

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY


                         BLINDING WHITENESS
          We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically.
          A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing
          whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the
          ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.

          ON THE WOMAN'S FACE
          Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then...
          ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing
          pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s).
          We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their
          movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at
          her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops.
          Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.

                                                  PAUL
                      What's wrong?

                                                  ANNA
                      Nothing.
          Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.

                                                  PAUL

                                            (SIGHS WEARILY)
                      You used to enjoy it. Now it's...
          He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette.

                                                  PAUL
                      ...it's like fucking a corpse.
          Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna.

                                                   PAUL
                      Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was--
          Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul
          puts his head in his hands.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred
          ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.

                                                  PAUL
                      Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid
                      thing to say.   But you know sometimes...
                      sometimes it's like you're not here
                      anymore. Like you're somewhere else.

                                                                      2.

                         

                         
          Anna doesn't reply.

                                                PAUL
                    Is this about us?

                         ON ANNA
          her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.

                                                ANNA
                    It's not about us.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                    Then what is it?

                                                ANNA
                    I don't know.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                    I just want us to be happy.
          Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                    Are you happy?
          She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply.

                                                   ANNA
                    I'm happy.

          A DROP OF BLOOD
          falls into the water.   Then another drop.

                         ON ANNA
          her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks
          impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF
          WATER carries into the next scene...

                                                       FADE TO WHITE.

                         

          A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER
          A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant.
          Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them
          meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel.
          Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

          A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.
          Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old
          trees onto statues of grieving angels.

                                                                   3.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

          A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of
          violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING

          Sun streams into an elegant wood-panelled room. The
          Funeral Director, ELIOT DEANE (40s) guides MRS. AYRES
          (70s) past caskets tastefully arranged on faux-marble
          pedestals. He's a serene man. Quiet and professional.

                                                ELIOT
                    The Antique Carlisle. Solid cherry.
                           (strokes the wood lovingly)
                    Hand rubbed satin finish. Tufted
                    sovereign interior. Eternal-Rest
                    adjustable mattress with matching pillow.
          He gestures to a metal casket.

                                                ELIOT
                    Or perhaps the Aegean? Solid bronze
                    exterior. Hand brushed finish with
                    Grecian bronze highlights.

                                 MRS. AYRES
                    The Antique Carlisle. Definitely the
                    Antique Carlisle.

                                                ELIOT
                           (writes in his notebook)
                    Excellent choice.
          Mrs. Ayres caresses the soft velvet trimming.

                                 MRS. AYRES
                    An antique coffin for an antique lady.
                    We suit each other.

                                                 ELIOT

                    You'll look beautiful.

                                          (BEAT)
                    Now about the service.   Would you like a
                    private visitation?
          Mrs. Ayres is miles away.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Mrs. Ayres?

                                 MRS. AYRES
                    I'm sorry. Yes. A private visitation.

                                          (HESITATES)
                    Mr. Deane? What happens when we die?

                                                                    4.

                         

                         
          Eliot chooses his words carefully.

                                                ELIOT
                    It's different every time.   Each person
                    dies in their own way.

                         

          INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - MORNING

          Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town
          in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
          DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a
          red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the
          vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.
          The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind
          her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...
          ... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on
          her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The
          DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.

                         

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Anna locks her car.   Heads towards the main building.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNING

          Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy,
          walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER
          BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY
          against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.

                                                 TALL KID
                    Hey.   Jack-off!
          Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him.
          He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's
          lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him
          jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic
          incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.

                                 TALL KID (O.C.)
                    Didn't you hear me Jack-off?
          Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as
          the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply.

                                                ACNE KID
                    He must be deaf.

                                                                     5.

                         

                         

                                                TALL KID
                    You deaf Jack-off?
          Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more.

                                                TALL KID
                    Can't fucking speak either.
          He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator.
          Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just
          then the door opens. Anna walks in.

                                                ANNA
                    What's going on?
          She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.

                                                 ANNA
                    Jack?

                                                JACK
                    Nothing Miss Bryant.

                                                ANNA
                    Nothing? The incubator didn't just
                    fall by itself.
          The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction.

                                                 JACK
                    I tripped.   It was an accident.
          Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying.

                                                ANNA
                           (to the Older Boys)
                    Show's over. Get to your classes.

                                          (TO JACK)
                    Jack. Help me clear up.
          Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY
          CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.

                                                JACK
                    I think it's dead.
          Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick.

                                                 ANNA
                    No.   The poor thing's just scared.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY

          School's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of
          exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF
          PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry.

                                                                     6.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large
          conference table covered with documents and thick files.
          He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty.

                                                 PAUL
                    OK.   Who took the last pepperoni?
          A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.

                                                PAUL
                    Great.  Broccoli.
                           (lifts out a slice)
                    Who the fuck ordered broccoli?
          NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up.

                                                NEAL
                    Oh that's just disgusting.

                                                PREPPY GUY
                    What's wrong with vegetarian pizza?   It's
                    healthy.

                                                NEAL
                    Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy.
          Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time.
          He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door.

                                                NEAL
                    You ordering in another pizza?

                                                  PAUL
                    Yeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts.
          Everyone laughs.

                                               PREPPY GUY

                                         (MUTTERS)
                    Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses.

          Paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She
          fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door.
          Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call.

                                                                   7.

          Paul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard.

                                                  PAUL
                    Hi baby.    I'm really sorry about this
                    morning.    I fucked up. I know.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

          Anna steps into an empty corridor.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)

                                          (FILTERED)
                    We still on for tonight?

                    I don't know Paul.

                         

          INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

          Paul's anxious.    We sense he's hiding something.

                                                  PAUL
                    Please Anna.    It took me weeks to get the
                    table.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)

                                          (FILTERED)
                    Maybe we can change it to Thursday--

                                                   PAUL
                    No.     It has to be tonight.

                                ANNA (O.S.)

                                         (FILTERED)
                    Paul? What's the matter?
          Paul tries hard to cover his nervousness.   Forces a smile.

                                                PAUL
                    Nothing. Don't worry. I just need... I
                    just want us to have dinner tonight.

          Despite Paul's reassurances Anna is clearly worried now.

                                                  ANNA

                                            (HESITATES)

                    OK.

                    Great.

                         

          INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

          Paul hesitates.    Lowers his voice.

                                                  PAUL
                    And Anna.    Everything's going to be fine.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)

                                          (FILTERED)
                    Promise?

                                                  PAUL
                    I promise.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks
          through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo
          loudly in the eerie quietness.
          Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her
          blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns.
          WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step.
          The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly
          creeping up behind her. There's only one light still on
          as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light
          flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her in a
          cold pool of light.
          Anna's unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the
          door. It doesn't open. She pushes hard with both hands.
          Nothing. It's locked. She turns back slowly. The
          darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She
          reaches out...
          ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness.     Anna
          snatches her hand back. Stares at it.
          Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS.    Moving
          deliberately towards her.

                                                  ANNA

                                            (NERVOUSLY)
                    Hello?
          Her voice echoes down the silent corridor.   She glimpses
          something move in the blackness.

                                                ANNA
                    Is someone there?

                                                                       9.

                         

                         
          A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent.
          Brooding. Anna can't move. Terrified. Suddenly the
          corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.
          Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand.     As she
          tentatively pulls her hand away...
          ...it's only Jack.   His hand on the light switch.

                                                  ANNA
                    Jack!

                                                JACK
                    Did I scare you Miss Bryant?
          Jack moves over to the door.

                                                  ANNA
                    It's locked.
          He gently pushes against the door.    The door slowly opens.

                         

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.

                                                ANNA
                    Shouldn't you be home?

                                                 JACK
                    My mom's picking me up.

                                          (BEAT)
                    It's my birthday. We're going to
                    MacDonald's. Then on Saturday my mom's
                    taking me to Busch Gardens. We're
                    going to ride the Alpengeist.

                                          (EARNESTLY)
                    Continually voted one of the top ten roller
                    coaster rides in America, the Alpengeist is
                    a breathtaking avalanche of adventure.

                                                ANNA
                           (tries to keep a straight-face)
                    I didn't know the park was open yet.

                                                JACK
                    My mom's friends with the manager.
                    They're opening it specially for me.
          She knows he's lying again.     Smiles sadly.

                                                ANNA
                    Sounds like fun.

                                                  JACK
                    Yes.    It will be fun.

                                                                      10.

                         

                         
          They reach Anna's car.    Stand in silence for a moment.

                                                ANNA
                     Jack. Those boys.    Do they bother you
                     a lot?
          Jack hesitates.    Then slowly nods his head.

                                                 ANNA
                     You know you can always talk to me about
                     it if you want to.
          He nods.   Anna's clearly worried about him.

                                                 ANNA
                     You sure you don't need a ride?
          Jack shakes his head.    Anna glances at her watch.

                                                  ANNA
                     Well.   I better run.

                                                 JACK
                     Where are you going?

                                                 ANNA

                                           (HESITATES)
                     I have to go to a funeral.   My old piano
                     teacher.

                                                 JACK
                            (with sudden interest)
                     Can I come?

                                                  ANNA
                     No Jack.   Funerals are very private
                     affairs.

                                                 JACK
                     I've never been to a funeral.

                                                 ANNA
                     It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway
                     wouldn't your mom worry about you?

                                                 JACK

                                           (SHRUGS)
                     Not really.

                                                 ANNA
                     I'm sure she would. I'll see you
                     tomorrow in class. Have a wonderful
                     birthday.
          Jack nods disappointed.   Anna watches him walk away then
          gets in her car.

                                                                   11.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. ANNA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly
          blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes
          the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills
          from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove
          compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs.

                         

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then
          unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange
          jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up
          and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own.

                         

          EXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAY

          Anna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill
          with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon.
          Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window.
          Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door
          handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when
          the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a
          freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.

                         

          INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

          Anna leans back against a washbasin.    Her neck tightly
          cradled against the white porcelain.    The light's harsh
          and not particularly flattering. She    closes her eyes.
          Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER   in latex gloves
          begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair.

                         ON SINK
          Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink.
          Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually
          turns a deep crimson red.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY

          Anna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as
          she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her
          hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room,
          we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough.

                                  OLD WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Anna?   Is that you?

                                                 ANNA
                    Yes Mother.

                                                                   12.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with
          swift, violent precision. The bedside table's stacked
          with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some
          time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room.
          Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a
          second. Then returns to her knitting.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Terrible color.
          Anna moves to the beside table.   Picks up a dirty plate.

                                                ANNA
                    Can I get you something to eat?

                                                BEATRICE
                    I'm not hungry.

                                                ANNA
                    You have to eat.

                                                BEATRICE
                    I don't have to do anything.

                                                ANNA
                    The doctor said--

                                                BEATRICE
                    The doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know
                    what he's talking about.
          Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke
          her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Why did you do it? Today of all days.

                                                ANNA
                    What have I done wrong this time?
          Anna goes to the window.   Draws back the curtains.

                                                BEATRICE
                    You've forgotten haven't you?

                                                ANNA
                    No I haven't forgotten.   The service
                    isn't till six.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Then you've got plenty of time to wash it
                    out.

                                                                   13.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    It's permanent. You can't wash it out.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Then dye it back. You can't show up at
                    the funeral looking like that. Like some
                    prostitute.

                                                ANNA
                    I don't look--

                                                BEATRICE
                    Don't argue with me. Why are you
                    constantly arguing with me?
          Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Where are you going?

                                                ANNA
                    To do the washing up.

                                                BEATRICE
                    The sheets need changing.    They haven't
                    been changed in months.

                                                ANNA
                    I changed them Monday.
          Anna goes to the cupboard.    Takes out clean sheets.

                                                BEATRICE
                    You weren't here Monday. You never sleep
                    at home anymore. What if something
                    happened to me in the middle of the night?

                                                ANNA
                    Nothing is going to happen to you.

                                   ANYWAY DIANE--

                                                BEATRICE

                                          (SNORTS)
                    Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn't have
                    to pay for a Nurse if my only daughter
                    wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of
                    hers. Doing God knows what. They always
                    leave you in the end. You'll see. Just
                    like your father--

                                                ANNA
                    That's enough Mother!
          Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave
          Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist.

                                                   BEATRICE
                    That's it.     Go and cry to Paul.

                                                                     14.

                         

                         
          Anna pulls herself free.   Moves to the door.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Go and bitch to Paul about your mean old
                    mother.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

          A warm intimate room. Peaceful. Rows of chairs filled
          with ELDERLY MOURNERS. Eliot stands respectfully beside
          a casket. FATHER GRAHAM (50s) reads at a lectern.

                                                FATHER GRAHAM
                    We have entrusted our brother James
                    Hutton to God's mercy in sure and...

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Anna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel
          driveway. She stops. Stares out over the cemetery.

                                 FATHER GRAHAM (O.S.)
                    ...certain hope of the resurrection to
                    eternal life through our Lord Jesus
                    Christ, who died and rose again for us.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna slips into the back of the room. Eliot leads MRS.
          HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON
          (70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a
          bouquet of white roses by the casket.

                                 MRS. HUTTON
                    White roses. They were his favorite.
                    How did you know?

                                                ELIOT
                    They just seemed appropriate somehow.

                                 MRS. HUTTON
                    He looks so peaceful. As if he's only
                    sleeping.
          Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton.   She doesn't notice Eliot
          watching her carefully.

                                                  ANNA
                    Mrs. Hutton.    I'm so sorry.

                                 MRS. HUTTON
                    Thank you Anna. You were always his
                    favorite student.

                                                                    15.

                         

                         
          Anna smiles awkwardly.     Uncomfortable.

                                    MRS. HUTTON
                       How's your mother?

                                                    ANNA
                       Fine.   She sends her condolences.

                                    MRS. HUTTON
                       You look tired dear.

                                                    ANNA
                       No.   I'm fine. Everything's fine.
          But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine.
          Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER.
          Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.

                         ANNA'S POV
          James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming.
          Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face
          serene again. It must have been her imagination. She
          glances up quickly. Embarrassed.
          Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

          A spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully
          pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall.
          Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge
          of ANOTHER POLAROID.
          Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment,
          then takes off his jacket and moves to the window.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys.
          Getting increasingly frustrated.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

          Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of
          her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the
          keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag.
          She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary.
          She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back
          her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.

                                                                    16.

                         
          Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her
          hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

          Eliot watches intently as Anna drives away.

                         

          INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

          Paul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside.
          He glances at his watch then nervously checks his
          pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a
          moment then slips it back into his pocket.
          As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her
          raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment
          through the window marbled with rain.
          Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window.   He starts.
          Spills some of his red wine on his shirt.
          CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower.
          Spreading out over the white material.

                                 ANNA (O.C.)
                    Sorry about that.
          Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.

                                                PAUL
                    You scared the life out of me.
          Anna laughs as she sits down.   Paul looks up at her.

                                                 PAUL
                    Your hair.

                                                ANNA
                    You don't like it.

                                                PAUL
                    I didn't say that. It's just very...
                    red. I mean it's not really you is it?
          A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.

                                                WAITER
                    Are you ready to order?

                                                  PAUL
                    Yes.    We'll have the duck.

                                                 ANNA
                    Paul.

                                                                  17.

                         

                         

                                                  PAUL
                    What?    You always have the duck here.

                                                ANNA
                           (picks up the menu)
                    I don't always have the duck.
          Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through
          the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad
          impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.

                                                ANNA
                    I'll have the duck.
          Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore
          him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.

                                                PAUL
                    The duck is very good.
          Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken
          for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.

                                                PAUL
                    Let's not argue tonight.    OK?

                                                 ANNA

                    OK.
          Anna takes a sip of wine.

                                                ANNA
                    This is good.
          She picks up the bottle.    Checks the label.

                                                ANNA
                    And looks very expensive...

                                          (SMILES QUESTIONINGLY)
                    What's the special occasion?
          Paul's momentarily thrown. He tries to cover it by
          rearranging his napkin. Anna notices.

                                                PAUL
                           (suddenly very serious)
                    Actually there is something I need to
                    talk to you about.
          Now Anna's nervous.

                                                PAUL
                    I've been offered a transfer to head
                    office in Chicago.
          Anna looks down.   Stares at her hands on the table.

                                                                   18.

                         

                         

                                                PAUL
                    It'll mean more work of course. More
                    responsibility. A lot of changes. But
                    it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be
                    crazy to turn it down. And...

                                          (NERVOUS)
                    ...well I've been thinking. Maybe it's
                    time for us to...
          Paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket.

                                                ANNA
                           (without looking up)
                    You're going to leave me.
          Paul's stunned.   Speechless.   Before he can say anything--

                                                ANNA
                    You could've just told me this morning.
                    You didn't need to buy me off with an
                    expensive meal.
          Paul reaches for her hand.     Anna gets up to leave.

                                                 PAUL
                    Anna wait.

                                                ANNA
                    Why did you lie to me? You promised
                    everything was going to be OK.

                                                PAUL

                                          (INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED)
                    Don't be ridiculous. Anna. You've got
                    it all wrong.

                                                ANNA
                    I'm not being ridiculous. Why do you
                    always talk to me like I'm a small child?

                                                 PAUL
                            (as if talking to a small child)
                    Anna.

                                                ANNA
                    See? There you go again.      Do you know
                    how irritating that is?

                                                PAUL

                                          (LOSES IT)
                    Jesus. Can't we just have one fucking
                    meal without arguing--

                                                 ANNA
                    Fuck you!
          The other DINERS turn and stare at them. Paul glances at
          them embarrassed. Anna doesn't notice. Upset.

                                                                   19.

                         

                         

                                                PAUL
                    Keep your voice down, everyone's watching.

                                                 ANNA

                    FUCK YOU!

                                                PAUL
                    You're crazy. You know that?      Just like
                    your mother.

                                                ANNA
                    I'm nothing like my mother!
          Anna grabs her coat.   Pushes her way through the restaurant.

                                                PAUL

                                          (STANDS)
                    I'm not running after you this time Anna.

                                                 ANNA
                    Good.
          Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. He
          quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious.

                         

          INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - NIGHT

          Anna closes the car door.   It's still raining hard outside.
          Her hair, perfect minutes ago, is now bedraggled. Her make-
          up's running. She places her hands on the steering wheel.
          Trying desperately to pull herself together.
          Suddenly. THUMP. Anna jumps. Turns. Paul's at the car
          window. He thumps the glass again. Anna hits the locks.

                         

          EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

          Paul grabs the door handle.

                                                PAUL
                    Anna. Open the door. Please. I want
                    you to come with me. I want to...

                         

          INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Anna can't hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING
          onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive.

                         

          EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

          Paul stumbles aside as Anna's car pulls away. She stops
          at the parking lot exit a short distance away.

                                                                       20.

                         

                         

                         

          INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Anna looks up into the rearview mirror.

          ON REARVIEW MIRROR
          Paul stands forlornly in the rain.      Their eyes meet.

                         ANNA'S CAR
          She hesitates.       For a moment we think she might go back
          to him...

                         

          EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

          ... but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul
          alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt.

                         

          INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers
          battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows
          past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway.
          Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the
          dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to
          side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she
          dials a number. She looks up...
          a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.

                                                     ANNA
                       Shit!
          Anna swerves into the next lane.      We hear the blaring
          horn from the car behind her.

                                                  ANNA
                             (into rear-view mirror)
                       OK. OK. I saw you.

                                            (MUTTERING)
                       Jerk.
          The cell phone connects.      We hear Paul's answering machine.

                                                   ANNA
                       Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?      I
                       just don't want it to end like this.
          Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat.
          Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass.
          A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes.

                                                                        21.

                         

                         

          ON METAL PIPES
          The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          Darkness.   A bright light comes on.
          CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of
          crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands.
          Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft
          morning light seeps in from a small round window set high
          on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel.
          In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab
          covered with a white sheet.
          We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The
          room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.
          Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket.
          Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale
          blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every
          move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual.
          Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly
          clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab
          for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away
          revealing...
          ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her
          eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress
          soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe.
          Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist.
          Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe.
          Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel
          trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off.
          He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when...
          Anna OPENS HER EYES.
          She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes.
          Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He calmly steps back.
          Watches her carefully.
          Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot.     She's groggy.   Confused.

                                                                   22.

                         

                         

                                                   ANNA
                      Where am I?
          She talks with difficulty.       Her breathe labored.

                                                   ELIOT
                      You're in a funeral home.

                                            (BEAT)
                      You're dead.
          Anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit
          up but she can't even raise her head. Her body stiff.
          Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly.

                                                  ELIOT
                      You had a car accident. It was raining.
                      You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.
          She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand.

                                                  ANNA
                      I'm not dead.

                                                  ELIOT
                      You were pronounced dead eight hours ago.
                      Your blood no longer circulates through
                      your body. Your brain cells are slowly
                      dying. Your body's already decomposing.

                                                  ANNA
                      I'm not dead.
          Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the
          bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document.
          Holds it up for her.

                         ON DOCUMENT
          It's Anna's death certificate.

                                   ELIOT (O.C.)
                      This is your death certificate. Cause of
                      death. Massive internal trauma. Time of
                      death. 8.23PM.

                         PREP ROOM

                                                  ELIOT
                      You were dead on arrival. The attending
                      physician signed here...
                             (points to document)
                      ...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your
                      body from the hospital morgue at 12.10
                      this morning.
          Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at
          Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so
          distressed.

                                                                     23.

                         

                         

                                                  ELIOT
                    I'm sorry.
          Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley.   Wets it.

                                                  ANNA
                    Who are you?
          Eliot delicately washes Anna's face. She doesn't flinch
          as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.

                                                ANNA
                    Don't touch me! Why are you touching me?

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm preparing your body. You have to
                    look beautiful for your funeral.

                                                ANNA
                    I'm not dead.
          Eliot sighs wearily.   As if he'd had this conversation
          many times before.

                                                 ELIOT
                    You all say the same thing.

                                          (BEAT)
                    I'm sorry. Maybe you should rest now.
          Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door.
          As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and
          looks at Anna for a moment.

                         ON ANNA
          The lights go off. O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks
          automatically behind Eliot.

                                                ANNA

                                          (SOFTLY)
                    I can't be dead. It's just a nightmare.
                    I'll wake up soon. Wake up.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MORNING

          Paul wakes up. Badly hung-over. Still in his clothes.
          Sunlight streams into the room. Blinding him. He
          reaches across. The bed's empty. He's surprised for a
          moment then remembers the argument the night before.
          He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a
          cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. Leans
          down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the
          RING BOX falls onto the floor. Paul doesn't notice.

                                                                    24.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - LATER

          Paul steps into the kitchen. Nervously checking his
          BlackBerry. Nothing. Just then he sees the red light
          blinking on his answer machine. He presses play.

                                                ANNA
                    Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?       I
                    just don't want it to end like this.
          Paul's relieved. He picks up the phone.   Dials.   We hear
          the ringing on the other end.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - SAME TIME

          Two technicians, an OLD GUY and his YOUNG PALE ASSISTANT,
          push a NAKED BODY wrapped in plastic through the morgue.
          They jump as they hear the MUFFLED sound of a cell phone.
          The ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on
          a table (we recognize it as Anna's bag). The Assistant
          walks over. Takes out the cell phone.

                                                ASSISTANT
                    It's the schoolteacher's. From the car
                    crash. Should I answer it?
          The ringing stops abruptly.   It's suddenly very silent.

                                                ASSISTANT
                    Someone's in for a surprise.

                                                OLD GUY
                    How many times do I have to tell you? You
                    can't leave their stuff laying around. It
                    should've been returned to the family.

                                                ASSISTANT
                    I've been busy, OK.

                                          (MUTTERING)
                    Like she's really going to need her
                    rollover minutes now.
          As the Assistant reaches for the bag, he notices a
          solitary shoe on the table. He picks it up.

                                                ASSISTANT
                    What shall I do with this?

                                                OLD GUY
                    Where's the other one?
          The Assistant looks round. He can't see the other shoe
          anywhere. He turns to the Old Guy and shrugs.

                                                                      25.

                         

                         

                                                OLD GUY
                    Just burn it. You can't send them back
                    one shoe. It's not respectful.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          We hear a BEEP.

                                                PAUL

                                          (ON PHONE)
                    You got it all wrong baby. I want you to
                    come to Chicago with me. Look. I'll
                    swing by your place on my way to the
                    office. You know I love you.

                         

          EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

          Paul pulls up to a suburban house. Walks quickly to the
          door, a supermarket bouquet of flowers wrapped in
          cellophane in his hand. He rings the bell. No-one
          answers. He rings again. Knocks hard on the door.

                                                PAUL
                    Anna!
          Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the
          driveway's empty. He heads back to his car.

                         

          INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul's on his cell phone as he drives.    He gets Anna's
          voice mail again.

                                                PAUL

                                          (INTO PHONE)
                    It's me again. I must have just missed you
                    at home. Call me when you get this. OK?

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - DAY

          Paul strides down an empty corridor. The flowers in his
          hand. Searching for Anna's classroom.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          A TEACHER stands in front of the class holding a shell.

                                                TEACHER
                    ... the shell grows slowly...
          The door opens. Paul steps into the classroom.    His
          smile fades as he realizes it's not Anna.

                                                                    26.

                         

                         

                                                 PAUL
                    Oh hi.   I'm looking for Anna Bryant.
          The Teacher quickly moves over.    Hustles Paul to the door.

                                                TEACHER

                                          (INDIGNANT)
                    I'm sorry but you just can't--

                                                PAUL
                    I'm Anna's... fiancée. Paul Conran.     I
                    thought this was her class.
          The Teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand.

                                                PAUL
                    We had a little misunderstanding last
                    night.

                                                TEACHER

                                          (HESITATES)
                    She didn't come in today.
          Jack's in the front row.   Following the conversation.

                                                PAUL
                    Did she call in sick?

                                                TEACHER
                    She hasn't called in at all. It's not
                    like her. She always calls in.
          Paul's worried now.   Something's wrong.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Anna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one
          side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed.
          Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns.
          Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty.
          Nervously looks around.
          For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she
          sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation
          as he approaches her.

                                                ANNA
                    Please don't hurt me.

                                                ELIOT

                                          (SMILES)
                    How can I hurt you?     You're already dead.

                                                ANNA
                    But I'm not dead.

                                                                   27.

                         

                         

                                                ELIOT
                    Then why are you here?
          Anna doesn't know what to say.   She turns her head away.
          A tear falls down her cheek.

                                               ANNA
                    Please. Just let me go. I won't go to
                    the police. I won't tell anyone.
          Eliot moves her head back.   Gently wipes away her tear.

                                                ELIOT
                    You're still in denial. You have to
                    trust me. I'm only here to help you.
          Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies
          her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how
          to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments.
          Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna.
          The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her
          skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews
          the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job.
          Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an
          AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid.
          Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.

                                                ELIOT
                    Don't be scared.

                                                ANNA
                    What are you doing?

                                                ELIOT
                    This will relax your muscles. Stop the
                    rigor mortis setting in so I can work on
                    your body.
          He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car
          pull up on the gravel driveway outside.

                                                ELIOT

                                          (TO HIMSELF)
                    Your mother's early.
          Anna's eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close.
          Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          A Nurse, DIANE (30s) follows Beatrice in her wheelchair
          as Eliot leads them through the hallway.

                                                                   28.

                         

                         

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's
                    always so tragic when you lose a child.

                                                BEATRICE
                    I lost her years ago.
          He glances at her curiously.    Then gestures to his office.

                                                ELIOT
                    If you'd care to come to my office we can
                    discuss the arrangements.

                                                BEATRICE
                    I want to see her.

                                                ELIOT
                    But she hasn't been--

                                                BEATRICE
                    I don't care. I want to see her.
          It takes him a second to respond.

                                                ELIOT
                    Of course.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Beatrice leans against the slab staring at Anna's covered
          body. Eliot stands respectfully to one side. In the b.g.
          Diane shivers. The room's cold. Beatrice touches Anna's
          hand through the white sheet. Then uncovers Anna's face.
          The needle's still embedded in her eyebrow.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Ah.   Forgive me.
          Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle.    Cuts
          the thread with a pair of large scissors.

                                                ELIOT
                    As I said. I've only just started
                    preparing her.

                                                BEATRICE
                    What's the point of preserving the body
                    if the soul's already left?

                                                 ELIOT
                            (quietly to himself)
                    No.   The soul never leaves.
          Beatrice stares at Anna.

                                                                          29.

                         

                         

                                                   BEATRICE
                       It's us who are left behind. It's us who
                       suffer.

                                             (TO ANNA)
                       Who's going to look after me now? Did
                       you think about that?
          She nods to Diane.    Diane helps her into the wheelchair.

                                                   ELIOT
                       I'll confirm the date with Father Graham
                       this afternoon. Friday as you requested.

                                                   BEATRICE
                       Just do what you think's best.   It's just
                       details.
          Beatrice whirs towards the door.      She suddenly stops.
          Turns to Eliot.

                                                   BEATRICE
                       Oh there is one thing.

                                                   ELIOT
                       Yes?

                                                   BEATRICE
                       Her hair. She was a brunette.    I'd like
                       it back to that color.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

          Eliot watches Beatrice's car drive away.

                         

          INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR - DAY

          Paul waits in his car outside the Mother's house.        The
          wilting flowers on the passenger seat beside him.

                         PAUL'S POV
          Beatrice's car pulls up. Diane gets out.      Pulls the
          wheelchair out of the car.

                         PAUL'S CAR
          Paul grabs the flowers.

                         

          EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul strides over as Diane helps Beatrice into her
          wheelchair.

                                                                   30.

                         

                         

                                                   PAUL
                    Mrs. Bryant.
          Beatrice doesn't acknowledge him.   Paul turns to Diane.

                                                 PAUL
                    Hi Diane.   I need to talk to Anna.
          Diane can't look him in the eye.

                                                PAUL
                    What's wrong?

                                                DIANE
                    I think you better come in.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Beatrice sits in her wheelchair with her back to the
          door. Paul stops a short distance away.

                                                PAUL
                    What happened? Where's Anna?

                                                BEATRICE

                                          (WITHOUT TURNING)
                    Anna was in a car accident last night.
                    My daughter's dead. That's what
                    happened.
          Paul stares at Beatrice's back in disbelief.

                                                   PAUL
                    A car crash?     When?
          Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul.

                                                BEATRICE

                                          (IRRITABLY)
                    I don't know.

                                                DIANE
                    They said it happened just before 8.30.

                                                PAUL
                    But... we were at the restaurant...
          Beatrice glares at him.    She clearly blames him for
          Anna's death.

                                                BEATRICE
                    You shouldn't have let her drive in that
                    weather.
          Paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand.

                                                                    31.

                         

                         

                                                PAUL
                    No. She can't be dead.    There must be
                    some mistake.

                                                BEATRICE
                    There's no mistake. We just got back
                    from the funeral home.
          Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair.   As she
          whirs past Paul she notices the flowers.

                                                BEATRICE

                                          (DRYLY)
                    Flowers? How appropriate.
          Paul's not listening anymore.   Stunned.

                                                PAUL
                    Why didn't you call me?

                                                BEATRICE
                    You took her away from me.   I don't want
                    you anywhere near her.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - DAY

          Eliot turns on the taps.   Fills a copper kettle.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Silence. O.S. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. Anna
          opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep.
          She stares at us. Numb.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          CLOSE ON an exploding BLUE FLAME from a gas ring.
          We pull back. Eliot places a kettle on the ring. Then
          measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin
          into a teapot. Meticulous in everything he does.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          CLOSE ON Anna's hand. Her fingers FLEX slightly. She
          pushes herself up awkwardly. Suddenly realizes
          something. She touches her wrist. Desperately searching
          for her pulse. Then frantically checks her neck.
          Panicking. She can't find her heartbeat.
          She stares at her hand. Then abruptly SLAMS it against
          the slab. Hard. She feels no pain. She does it again.
          Harder. Still nothing.

                                                                    32.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    I must be in shock.     That's all.   It's
                    just shock.
          She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door.
          Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the
          door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her
          head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs.

                                                ANNA

                                          (HOARSE)
                    Let me out!

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Eliot's by his desk. Checking his appointment book.
          Whistling softly to himself. We can't hear Anna's cries.
          He pours a cup of tea. Adds a drop of milk. As he stirs
          his tea, he hears the sound of feet CRUNCHING on the
          gravel outside. He glances out the window.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly
          at the Funeral Home.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot steps out of the Funeral Home.     Heads towards Paul.

                                                ELIOT
                    Can I help you?
          Paul turns to him.   Pulled away from his thoughts.

                                                  PAUL
                    Mr. Deane?

                                                  ELIOT
                    Yes.

                                                PAUL
                    My name's Conran.      Paul Conran.
          Eliot smiles.    Holds out his hand.

                                                ELIOT
                    Of course. The lawyer.
                           (off Paul's surprised look)
                    It's a small town. In my line of work
                    you get to know everyone eventually.
          As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely.    As
          if he senses something.

                                                                    33.

                         

                         

                                                PAUL
                    I'm Anna Bryant's fiancée.

                                                ELIOT
                    That's strange. She wasn't wearing an
                    engagement ring.

                                                PAUL
                    Well not quite fiancée...

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.

                                                PAUL
                    I'd like to see her.

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm afraid the viewing isn't until--

                                                PAUL
                    I'd need to see her now.    If that's
                    possible.

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm sorry. It's not possible.     You're
                    not family and--

                                                 PAUL
                    Please.   It'd only take a minute.

                                                ELIOT
                    I understand. But--

                                                 PAUL

                    NO.   YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna suddenly hears Paul's loud voice outside.

                                               ANNA

                                         (WEAKLY)
                    Paul! I'm here! Paul!
          She frantically beats her fists against the door.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

          Paul quickly controls his anger.    His eyes smart with tears.

                                                PAUL
                    I tried to stop her.     She didn't hear me.
          Paul's voice breaks with emotion. He can't go on. Eliot
          gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car.

                                                                     34.

                         

                         

                                               ELIOT
                    Mr. Conran.  There really is nothing I
                    can do. I'm so sorry.
          Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head.     Eliot
          watches him get into his car and drive away.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - LATER

          Anna sits by the door in the darkness. Suddenly the
          room's flooded with light. Eliot walks in. Looks at
          Anna for a moment. She just stares back at him coldly.
          He heads over to the sink.

                                                ANNA
                    Who was that?

                                                  ELIOT
                    No one.

                                                  ANNA
                    No one?
          A long beat.

                                                  ELIOT
                    It was Paul.

                                                ANNA

                                          (CALMLY)
                    I know. I heard you talking to him.
                    Why didn't you let him see me?
          Eliot smiles. Amused she caught him out.   He continues
          washing his hands.

                                                ELIOT
                    Did you love him?
          Anna looks up sharply.   Eliot's clearly hit a nerve.

                                                ANNA
                    That's none of your business.
          Eliot shrugs.   Dries his hands on a white towel.

                                                ANNA
                    You weren't going to tell me Paul was
                    here, were you?

                                                  ELIOT
                    No.

                                                  ANNA
                    Why not?

                                                                   35.

                         

                         

                                                ELIOT
                    Because it would only hurt you. You have
                    to let go of the living. Just like they
                    have to let go of you.

                                                ANNA
                    I don't believe you.   Why are you doing
                    this to me?
          He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.

                                                ELIOT
                    You're all the same. You all blame me
                    for your death. As if it were my fault.

                                               ANNA
                    No. You drugged me.    So my mother

                                   WOULDN'T--

                                                ELIOT
                    The others. They just see you as a dead
                    body on a slab. Only I can see you as
                    you really are.

                                                ANNA
                    You're crazy!
          Eliot's taken aback.    Hurt.

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this.
          He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it.
          Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.

                                                ELIOT
                    Oh I nearly forgot.    How tall are you?

                                                  ANNA
                    What!?
          He looks her up and down.   Gauging her height.

                                                  ELIOT
                    Five seven.

                                                  ANNA
                    Why..?

                                                ELIOT
                    I need to know how tall you are.   For
                    your coffin.
          Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment.     Then
          switches off the main lights.

                                                                  36.

                         

                         

                                                 ANNA
                    Wait!
          He ignores her.   The door CLICKS shut behind him.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot steps into the hallway. Stops by a vase of
          flowers. He plucks a dead petal. Crushes it. Curiously
          sniffs his fingers. Then heads to the casket room.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks empty. Dispirited.
          Just then something catches her attention...
          The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE
          SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the
          trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness.
          Grabs the scissors.
          Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet,
          lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away.
          Scared. But then, almost against her will, she
          approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She
          slowly pulls the sheet away...
          The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna
          with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken,
          Anna pushes herself against the wall.

                                                 ANNA
                    Oh God.   Please. I don't want to die.

                         

          INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY

          Jack carefully cuts something out of a local newspaper.
          The loud sounds of a TV blare from another room.

                         ON NEWSPAPER
          Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash.

                         

          INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          The curtains are drawn. JACK'S MOTHER sits in an
          armchair with her back to us watching TV. Jack walks in.

                                                JACK
                    You were supposed to pick me up from
                    school yesterday.
          His mother doesn't reply.   Jack moves in front of the TV.

                                                                    37.

                         

                         

                                                   JACK
                       I waited.
          His mother doesn't respond.

                         

          EXT. STREETS - DAY

          Jack furiously cycles through empty streets. Past
          identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns. He
          stops suddenly. Considering something. Then turns and
          cycles away purposely.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

          Eliot walks out of the funeral home. We pull back. Jack
          stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot
          looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack
          steps back quickly behind a tree.

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          A POLICE OFFICER talks on the phone as Paul walks in.

                                                   POLICE OFFICER

                                             (INTO PHONE)
                       Hang on a sec.

                                             (TO PAUL)
                       Mr. Conran. Heard about your girlfriend.
                       I'm sorry.
          Paul nods.    Clearly doesn't want to talk about it.

                                                   PAUL
                       Is Tom in?

                                                   POLICE OFFICER
                       The captain just stepped out. He won't
                       be long. You can wait in his office if
                       you want.

                                                    PAUL
                       Thanks.   I'll just go and grab a coffee.
          As Paul walks away, the Officer returns to the phone.

                                                   POLICE OFFICER

                                             (INTO PHONE)
                       A buddy of the captain's. Poor guy...

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul slides a dollar bill into a coffee machine. Presses
          his selection. Nothing.

                                                                    38.

                         

                         

                                                  PAUL
                       Come on.
          He pushes the button repeatedly.   Then angrily slams the
          side of the machine. Nothing.

                                                   PAUL
                       You piece of shit.
          As Paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it:
          AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Paul glances around. Then
          quickly walks over to the door.

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          A dozen wrecked cars. Twisted metal. Paul's footsteps
          echo through the empty garage. It's dark. Out the
          corner of his eye Paul glimpses a SHAPE move quickly
          around a pillar. He stops. Unsettled.
          Just then we hear a WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS. Her high-heels
          clicking on the concrete floor. There's something
          strange about the sound. UNNATURAL. Paul listens
          nervously. The footsteps grow fainter. Then fade away.
          The garage is silent again. Too quiet.
          Paul moves apprehensively over to Anna's GREEN TOYOTA.
          The car's a mess. One side's completely caved in. He
          touches the car.   Pulls open the door. Squeezes into
          the driver's seat.

                         ANNA'S CAR
          Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
          DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his
          hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange
          noise. He looks up...
          The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling
          face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until
          it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us.
          Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE
          WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and
          touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns.
          ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him.   The
          color drains from Paul's face.

                                   MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
                       Paul?
          The Police Captain, Tom Peterson, stands by the car where
          Anna was a second ago. He pulls his hand away from
          Paul's shoulder. Looks at him with concern.

                                                                     39.

                         

                         
          Paul gathers his composure. He must have just imagined
          Anna was there. He shoves the door open. He's about to
          step out when he turns back and grabs the Kitschy Doll.

                         GARAGE
          Paul gets out awkwardly.    He can't look Tom in the eye.

                                                  TOM
                    You OK?

                                                PAUL

                                          (UNCONVINCING)
                    I'm fine.

                                                TOM
                    I just found out. I'm so sorry Paul.       If
                    you need anything--

                                                PAUL
                    I need to see Anna.

                                                TOM

                                          (PUZZLED)
                    What do you mean?

                                                PAUL
                    The funeral director won't let me see her
                    Tom. He says I'm not family. Can you
                    talk to him? Put some pressure on him.

                                                TOM
                    I can't do that.

                                                  PAUL
                    Tom.    You're my friend.

                                                   TOM
                    Paul.     I can't do it.
          Paul nods slowly.    Tom notices the Kitschy Doll.

                                                TOM
                    You sure you're OK?

                                                  PAUL
                    I fucked up.

                                                TOM
                    Paul. It was an accident. You should
                    get some rest. Let me drive you home.

                                                PAUL
                    I always fuck everything up.

                                                                    40.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Eliot stops by a thermostat. Studies it for a moment.
          Turns it lower. He glances at his watch. Takes out his
          keys from his jacket and moves over to the Prep Room door.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna sits on the slab. Her hands behind her back.    She
          carefully watches Eliot as he pulls on his pale blue
          smock then walks over to a cabinet.

          BEHIND ANNA'S BACK
          her hands clutch the large scissors.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with
          photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he
          looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind
          him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old
          Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully
          pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.

                                                   ANNA
                      Who is she?

                                                  ELIOT
                      Mrs. Whitehall.
          He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.

                                                  ELIOT
                      You shouldn't be afraid of her.   The dead
                      can't harm the dead.

                                                  ANNA

                                            (FORCEFULLY)
                      But I'm not dead!
          Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP...   she slashes at Eliot's
          face with the SCISSORS.
          The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops
          the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley.
          Instruments crash to the floor.
          Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank
          hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at
          the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly
          moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors.

                                                  ANNA
                      Stay where you are.

                                                                     41.

                         

                         

                                                  ELIOT
                             (holds out his hand)
                      Give me the scissors. I only want to
                      help you.

                                                  ANNA
                      Don't come any closer.     I swear to God
                      I'll kill you.
          Eliot walks right up to her.     His face now inches from hers.

                                                  ELIOT

                                            (CALMLY)
                      Go ahead.
          Anna doesn't move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye.
          He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings
          the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna's hand.

          CLOSE ON ELIOT'S FACE
          The sharp tip pushes into his skin.

                                                  ELIOT
                      Go on.

                         PREP ROOM
          For a moment we think she might do it.      But then she wavers.

                                                  ELIOT
                      What are you waiting for?
          Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand.
          The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down
          defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...

                                                  ANNA
                      I'm breathing!
                             (raises her head)
                      Look. I'm still alive!

                                                  ELIOT
                      You think you're still alive because
                      you're still attached to life. It's
                      normal. You're just imagining you still
                      have symptoms of life.
          She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels.
          Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.

                                                  ANNA
                      Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The
                      doctors made a mistake. They're always
                      making mistakes.

                                                   ELIOT
                      You died.   Everyone dies.

                                                                     42.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    How can I be dead if we're talking?
          He stands up.    Sighs wearily.

                                                 ELIOT
                    We're talking not because you're alive.
                    But because I have a gift.

                                          (BEAT)
                    I can talk to those between life and death.

                                                  ANNA
                    Why?

                                                ELIOT
                    To help them make the transition.
          Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of
          doubt in her mind.

                                                ANNA
                    Is this what happens when you die?

                                                ELIOT
                    It depends on how you lived your life.

                                                ANNA
                    What do you mean?

                                                ELIOT
                    Not everyone needs my help. Some let
                    go as soon as their body dies. Others
                    don't let go until long after they're
                    in the grave.

                                                ANNA
                    Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here?

                                                ELIOT
                    You're here so I can bury you.
          Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just
          heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.

                                                  ELIOT
                    Come.    We've wasted enough time already.
          She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired.       Eliot
          leans over her to apply what's left of the dye.

                                                  ANNA

                                            (WHISPERS)
                    No.    Please. I don't want--

                                                ELIOT
                    You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn't
                    count anymore.

                                                                   43.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    But I can breathe.     I must be alive.
          She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's
          face, but just as quickly he controls it.

                                                ELIOT
                    You people. You all think that if you
                    breathe, shit, piss you're alive.
          Anna doesn't know what to say.

                                                ELIOT
                    You clutch onto life as if your life was
                    worth clutching onto. Was your life
                    worth clutching onto Anna?
          Anna turns her head away.   Clearly he's struck a chord.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Was it?   Maybe you died a long time ago.
          Eliot rips off his latex gloves.    Tosses them into a bin.

                                                ELIOT
                    I have to tell you I'm surprised you're
                    still arguing with me. You don't have
                    much time left.
                           (gestures to the Old Women)
                    Look. She's accepted her death. Her
                    life has been examined. She has no more
                    regrets. And now she's at peace. She
                    used her time well. You still have so
                    much to learn.

                                                ANNA
                    I have nothing to learn!

                                                ELIOT
                    Are you sure?
          Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light.
          His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.

                                                ELIOT
                    Your funeral's in three days. Soon
                    you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then
                    buried in the ground. No-one will hear
                    you then. No-one will talk to you there.
          The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move.
          Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she
          looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly
          pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman
          curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.

                                                ANNA
                    Are you cold?

                                                                        44.

                         

                         
          She takes the Old Woman's hand.      Strokes her paper-thin skin.

                                                    ANNA
                      I'm so cold.
          Anna notices the Old Woman's plastic ankle tag.

          ON PLASTIC ANKLE TAG
          Name: Carol Whitehall.     Sex: F.   DOB: 11.02.30.

                         PREP ROOM

                                                  ANNA
                      You had a long life.
          Anna turns back.   Studies the Old Woman's serene face.

                                                   ANNA
                      You look so peaceful.

                                            (BEAT)
                      Aren't you scared?
          Anna's eyes fill with tears.

                                                    ANNA
                      I'm scared.    I'm so scared.

                         

          INT. JACK'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside
          table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an
          Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open
          shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light.
          The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even
          though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the
          box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches
          it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Paul stands motionless in the middle of the room. Staring
          blankly into space. The room feels empty and depressing.
          He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into
          the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player.
          Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He
          turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's
          unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb.

                         ON PAUL
          The music's strangely distorted now.        Almost silent.   As
          if we were inside Paul's head.

                                                                    45.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

          Anna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. O.S.
          we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty
          faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares
          at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.
          The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing
          her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.
          Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely
          larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain
          objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She
          notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.
          The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised.
          The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna
          with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to
          the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow
          to normal size.
          Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel
          trolley now towers high above her. The massive
          instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects
          cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a
          solid wall of DARKNESS.

          FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS
          the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark
          space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep
          Room behind her.

                         PREP ROOM
          Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick
          blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then...
          ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's
          wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna
          struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper
          into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.

                         

          INT. DARKNESS

          Anna stands in the black empty space.

                                   GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      I'm disappointed with you.
          An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of
          the blackness. She looks like a young Anna.

                                                    ANNA
                      Who are you?

                                                                   46.

                         

                         
          The Young Girl walks slowly towards Anna.

                                                  GIRL
                      You promised me so many things.

                                            (AMUSED)
                      You don't recognize me?
          Anna shakes her head.

                                                  GIRL
                      I am you. I've been waiting for you.
                      You shouldn't have disappointed me.
          The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back
          terrified. Turns. But there's no door anymore.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          The Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room.
          Braiding her long hair.

                                                  OLD WOMAN
                      You're not ready.

                                          CUT TO A SEARING WHITENESS.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

          A small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs.
          "AVE MARIA" plays quietly in the b.g. A MAN leans over
          the casket paying his respects.

                         ON CASKET
          The Old Woman.   Her long hair braided.   She looks serene.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          "AVE MARIA" filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes.
          She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the
          room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone.
          Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside.
          Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the
          wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a
          counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm
          across the counter top in rage. Sending everything
          crashing to the floor.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

          The funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of
          flowers from a vase.

                                                                      47.

                         

                         
          In the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway.
          Glancing around in fascination. A flower in his hand.

                                                ELIOT
                           (to Jack without looking up)
                    Can I help you?
          Jack steps back timidly.   Eliot looks up.   Smiles.

                                                ELIOT
                    Then perhaps you can help me.
                           (holds up the withered flowers)
                    Could you throw these away for me?
          Jack nods hesitantly.   Moves over and takes the flowers.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Thank-you.
          Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.

                         ON JACK
          as he looks at the wilted flowers.    He crushes a petal
          then sniffs his fingers.

                                 ELIOT (O.C.)
                    There's no life left in them.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Jack looks up.   Eliot's watching him carefully.

                                                ELIOT
                    They belong in the garbage.
          Jack turns to leave.

                                                ELIOT
                    I've seen you round here before.
          Jack's suddenly nervous.

                                                ELIOT
                    Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?

                                                JACK
                    I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral.

                                                ELIOT
                    Ah. Miss Bryant. No.       Her funeral's not
                    until Friday.

                                                JACK
                    Where is she now?
          Eliot considers the question for a moment.

                                                                    48.

                         

                         

                                                ELIOT
                    She's downstairs.

                                                   JACK
                    Why?

                                                 ELIOT
                    Why?  Because she's not ready.

                                          (BEAT)
                    Is the flower for her?

                                                 JACK

                                          (NODS)
                    She was my teacher.

                                                   ELIOT
                    And you are?

                                                   JACK
                    Jack.
          Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face.
          Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand.

                                                    ELIOT
                    Well Jack.      What did you think?

                                                   JACK
                    About what?

                                                ELIOT
                    Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.     Did you find
                    it interesting?

                                                JACK

                                          (SHRUGS)
                    It was OK I guess.

                                                   ELIOT
                    Oh.    I see.

                                                JACK
                    Are all funerals the same?

                                                ELIOT
                    No Jack. They're never the same. Each
                    one is special. The dead always speak to
                    us in different ways.

                                                JACK

                                          (CURIOUS NOW)
                    What do you mean?
          Eliot finished arranging the flowers.     He glances at his
          watch. Smiles at Jack.

                                                ELIOT
                    It was a pleasure talking to you Jack.

                                                                   49.

                         

                         
          Jack's intrigued.   He watches Eliot walk out of the room.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH
          from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to
          the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind
          him. He turns. Jack's at the top of the stairs.
          Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door.
          Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound
          as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then
          without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room.
          Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro.
          Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments.
          Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.

                                                ELIOT

                                          (ANGRY)
                    Why did you do this?
          Anna ignores him.   Eliot strides over to her.

                                                ELIOT

                    WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
          Anna stares at him blankly.

                                                ANNA
                    Is this the afterlife?    Am I in heaven?
                    Or am I in hell?
          Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He nods his head.   His
          anger gone now.

                                                ANNA
                    The door...

                                          (POINTS DISTRACTEDLY)
                    There was a door. Just there.

                                                ELIOT

                                          (GENTLY)
                    It won't be long now.

                                                ANNA
                    I used to believe in God. I thought I'd
                    see him when I died. Instead I saw you.
          Eliot softly strokes her hair.    Comforting her.

                                                                     50.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA

                                          (WHISPERS)
                    Maybe you are God.

                                                ELIOT
                    You'll be at peace soon.     I promise.
          For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's
          conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together.
          Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes.
          Hugs her legs closer to her chest.

                                                 ANNA
                    Paul.
          She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH.   The SIGH carries into
          the next scene...

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          The tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves. A
          sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage. Their
          leaves ripple. Languid and fluid like a wave. RUSTLING
          EERILY. The sound almost malevolent.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Paul's red-rimmed eyes snap open. He lies on his bed
          fully clothed. An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside
          table. Behind him the curtains stir.
          The KITSCHY DOLL'S head begins to slowly nod. Turning
          towards us. We hear the eerie rustling sound again.
          Like a MURMURING WHISPER...

                                  ANNA (O.S.)

                                           (WHISPERS)
                    Paul.
          Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It's only the
          wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets
          up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again.
          This time from the bathroom.
          Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the
          door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates.
          The room's strangely silent. He slowly opens the door...

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Nothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around
          nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face
          in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin.

                                                                    51.

                         

                         
          Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over
          the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps.
          Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for
          a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head
          slightly. A feeling.
          He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul
          dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of
          dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence.
          Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.
          Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a
          cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.

                         PAUL'S POV
          Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him.
          She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then
          her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET
          SUCKING sound...
          ...as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on
          the hook next to her bathrobe.

          ON THE STILL BEATING HEART
          dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles.

                         BATHROOM

                                                    PAUL

                                              (WHISPERS)
                       Anna.
          Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally
          translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be.
          The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist.
          She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of
          thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns
          away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later
          Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's
          not even running.

                         

          INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENING

          Jack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out
          a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell.
          From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV.

                                                     JACK

                                               (SHOUTS)
                       Mom!    We're out of milk.
          There's no reply.      Jack grabs his jacket.

                                                                   52.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING

          Anna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean
          and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment
          bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.

                                                    ANNA
                      What's that?

                                                  ELIOT
                      It's your dress. For your funeral. Your
                      mother brought it round this morning.
          As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a
          plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She
          touches the material puzzled.

                                                  ANNA
                      This isn't my dress.
                             (realizes with shock)
                      This is my mother's dress! It was
                      supposed to be for her funeral. Why has
                      she given it to me?
          Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices
          something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then
          takes something out.

          ON ELIOT'S HAND
          An old-fashioned wooden rosary.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at
          Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a
          drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and
          printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the
          drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.

                                                  ANNA
                      It should have been her not me.
                             (turns to Eliot)
                      She was the one dying. Not me.
          Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop.
          Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off
          his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a
          collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and
          snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.

                                                  ANNA
                      I'm not ready to die.
          Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.

                                                                   53.

                         

                         

                                                  ELIOT
                      Why are you still struggling?

                                                  ANNA

                                            (PLAINTIVELY)
                      I'm not ready to die.   Not yet.
          She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look.

                                                  ELIOT
                      There's nothing out there for you
                      anymore.
          As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's
          jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the
          pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still
          busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.

                         ON ELIOT
          as he gets up and turns to Anna.

                         PREP ROOM
          Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to
          get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels
          the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room.
          Nudges the door stop away with his foot.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I'll be back soon.
          The door locks behind him with a CLICK.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted
          windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of
          Anna just before the accident).

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on
          the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van
          drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys.

                         

          INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

          As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He's
          low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and
          makes a left turn.

                                                                  54.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna staggers to the door. There's at least a dozen keys.
          She frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock.

                                                ANNA
                           (begging the door to open)
                    Please.
          It doesn't fit. She's panicking. She fumbles for
          another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key
          SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.

                                                ANNA
                    No!
          Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments
          on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of
          surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.

                         

          EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

          Eliot replaces the pump nozzle.   Walks over to the cashier.

                                                CASHIER
                    Thirty-four fifty.
          In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out
          of the gas station. Eliot doesn't notice him as he pulls
          out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he
          frowns. Something's wrong. He checks his pockets again.
          He can't find his keys. He walks quickly away.

                                                 CASHIER
                    Sir.   Your change.
          Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued,
          Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna's still trying to pry out the broken key.

                                                ANNA

                                          (DESPERATELY)
                    Come on. Come on.

                         

          INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME

          Eliot's at a red light. Drumming his fingers in
          frustration as he waits for the light to change.

                                                                    55.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Finally Anna pulls out the broken key. Quickly chooses
          another. Turns it gently. Again it doesn't fit. Anna's
          hysterical now. She tries the next key. It fits! She's
          stunned for a second. Then pulls open the door.

                         

          INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME

          Eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

          Anna staggers to the front door. She pulls at the door.
          It won't open. Frantically she finds the key. Unlocks the
          door, leaving the keys in the lock. As she opens the door,
          HEADLIGHTS sweep across the hallway.

                         ANNA'S POV
          Eliot's van pulls up in front of the house.

                         ENTRANCE HALL
          Anna's trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot's footsteps
          on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

          Eliot reaches the front door. It's slightly ajar.   He
          pushes it open. Steps warily inside.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Eliot looks around. The entrance hall's empty.   Then he
          notices the keys in the lock.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          It's dark. Anna pulls at the back door. It won't budge.
          She panics. Sees a kitchen knife on the counter.
          Quickly grabs it. As she steps back, she knocks over a
          metal bucket. The sound's DEAFENING in the silent house.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Eliot hears the NOISE. Smiles. He calmly locks the door
          and puts the keys into his pocket. Moves down the
          hallway towards the kitchen.

                                                                       56.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot switches on the light.   The kitchen's empty.    He
          steps back into the hallway.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          He stands very still.    Watching.   Waiting.   We pull back.

          JUST AROUND THE CORNER
          Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife.

                         HALLWAY
          Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment
          changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction
          towards the viewing room.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks
          around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet
          STAMPING along the hallway behind him.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME

          Anna runs to the front door. It's locked. She glances
          around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs.
          She weakly stumbles up the stairs.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room.
          Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the
          telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME

          Eliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs.    He cocks his
          head upwards. Straining to listen.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          A telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen.

                                                                 57.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the
          RINGING on the other end.

                                                ANNA

                                          (DESPERATELY)
                    Please pick up. Please pick up.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. STAIRS - SAME TIME

          Eliot slowly climbs the stairs.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          The phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares
          at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks
          worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna glances back to the door in panic.

                                                 ANNA
                    Paul.   Please pick up.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          Finally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece.

                                               ANNA

                                         (FRENZIED WHISPER)
                    Paul. I'm here.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME


                                 ANNA (O.S.)

                                          (FILTERED)
                    Help me Paul.
          Anna's HOARSE DISTORTED VOICE sounds almost malevolent.
          Paul's stunned. He stares at the phone as if it was
          possessed. Then slowly puts it down.

                                                PAUL
                    Leave me alone.

                                                                    58.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna looks at the phone in disbelief. The MONOTONOUS
          TONE DRONES in the ear piece. She doesn't notice Eliot
          appear in the doorway.

                                                   ANNA
                      Paul.
          Suddenly the light comes on.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I'm the only one who can hear you now.
          Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window.      Eliot
          walks over and calmly replaces the phone.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I'd be very careful if I were you. The
                      dead have such a hold over the living.

                                                  ANNA
                      What do you mean?

                                                  ELIOT
                             (nods to the phone)
                      He still feels your presence. You're
                      only causing him more pain. If you
                      really loved him, you'd accept your death
                      and let him go.

                                                  ANNA
                      Then prove to me I'm really dead.

                                                   ELIOT
                      You people.   You always need proof.
          Eliot places his hands on her shoulders.    Turns her
          towards a tall mirror.

                         ON MIRROR
          A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes.      A blood-stained
          tear in the side of her RED SLIP.

                         UPSTAIRS ROOM
          Anna's stunned. She moves closer to the mirror.      Touches
          her reflection through a thin layer of dust.

                                                  ANNA
                      Why do I look like a corpse?

                                                  ELIOT
                      Because you are a corpse.

                                                                    59.

                         

                         

                         ON MIRROR
          Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.

                                    ELIOT (O.C.)
                       It's time you finally accepted the truth.
                       You are dead. You will never live again.

                                                   ANNA
                       I am dead.

                         UPSTAIRS ROOM
          Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of his child's first
          step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a
          brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle.    Looking
          up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY


                         JACK'S POV
          Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening
          in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.

                         DRIVEWAY
          Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at
          the window. Calmly. Curiously.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

          Eliot coolly turns back to Anna. She hasn't noticed
          Jack. Still staring at her reflection in the mirror.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul stares at the telephone. After a moment he slowly
          pulls the telephone plug out of the wall. Mechanically
          grabs a plastic bin liner from underneath the sink.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul opens the wardrobe. Pulls out Anna's clothes. Stuffs
          them into the bin liner. He notices the Kitschy Doll.
          Shoves it in with Anna's clothes.

                                                                    60.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Anna lies on the slab. She stares at us blankly. Her
          face emotionless. Resigned. Eliot rinses her hair now
          dyed back to brown. She slowly closes her eyes.
          CLOSE ON RED DYE draining into the sink.
          Eliot picks up the scissors. Carefully slices open
          Anna's red slip. Delicately peels the slip off her body.
          Anna doesn't react.
          CLOSE ON Anna. She opens her eyes. Confused.     She turns
          her head... she's in PAUL'S BEDROOM.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Paul lies in bed next to her watching her intently.     He
          looks different. Clean shaven. Sober.

                                                ANNA

                                          (RELIEVED)
                    Oh God.

                                                  PAUL
                    Bad dream?

                                                ANNA
                    I was dead. I had a car accident.     Did
                    you ever dream you were dead?
          Paul doesn't reply.    She turns... the bed's empty.

                                                  ANNA
                    Paul?

                                   PAUL (O.C.)
                    Yes?
          Anna looks up. Paul's in the doorway.    She gets up.
          Suddenly the light goes off.

                                                  ANNA
                    Paul.
          The light comes back on.   Paul stands by the light switch.

                                                ANNA
                    What are you doing?

                                                PAUL
                           (puts his finger to his lips)
                    Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake
                    the neighbors.

                                                                 61.

                         

                         
          Anna's getting nervous.    Something's not right.

                                                ANNA
                    What neighbors? You don't have any
                    neighbors.
          Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully.

                                                PAUL
                    Did you ever love me Anna?
          CLOSE ON Anna's face.    She looks away guiltily.

                                    PAUL (O.C.)
                    Did you?
          Anna closes her eyes.    Unable to answer.

                                    PAUL (O.C.)
                    Say it.     Say you love me.
          Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone.

                                                ANNA
                    Aren't you going to pick it up?

                                    PAUL (O.C.)
                    Me?   No.    It's probably for Eliot.
          Anna's eyes snap open in shock...

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Eliot stands over her. We're back in the PREP ROOM.   We
          hear the faint ringing of a phone from upstairs.

                                                ANNA
                    Is it always like this?

                                                ELIOT
                    What do you mean?

                                                 ANNA
                    I thought when you died you wouldn't
                    feel anything. You wouldn't feel any
                    more pain. You wouldn't have to
                    struggle anymore.

                                          (BEAT)
                    But it just doesn't stop does it?
          Upstairs the phone keeps on ringing.

                                                                 62.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. He looks at
          a day calendar on his desk. Idly flips over the page
          from Tuesday to Wednesday.

                                                 ELIOT
                    No.   It's no problem at all.
          He glances at his watch.

                                                ELIOT
                    I'll pick up the deceased from the
                    hospital. Yes. This afternoon? That'll
                    be fine. It's my pleasure Mr. Merano.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY

          GRAY BODIES lie on steel tables. Eliot moves over to one
          of the CORPSES. Examines it with professional interest.
          Just then the Old Guy walks in with the Pale Assistant
          pushing a gurney with a BODY wrapped in plastic sheeting.

                                                OLD GUY
                    Well here he is. Frank Merano.
          The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant
          unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away.

                         ON BODY
          FRANK (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened.
          His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face.

                                  ASSISTANT (O.C.)
                    Ouch.   That had to hurt.

                         MORGUE
          Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the
          release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Paul stands by a PRINCIPAL as they watch a JANITOR snap
          off the padlock on Anna's locker.

                                                PRINCIPAL

                                          (TO PAUL)
                    I'll leave you to sort out her things.

                                                PAUL
                    Thank you.

                                                                   63.

                         

                         
          The Principal and Janitor walk away. Paul reaches inside
          the locker. Pulls out a stack of exercise books. An
          empty pills bottle. Then he notices something in the
          back of the locker. He pulls it out.
          It's a PHOTOGRAPH of Paul and Anna together on vacation.
          Smiling. Happy. Paul looks at it for a moment. Trying
          hard to hold back his emotions.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - LATER

          The DEAFENING NOISE of schoolchildren.    Paul weaves his
          way through the crowded corridor.

                                  JACK (O.C.)
                    Mr. Conran?

                                                PAUL

                                          (TURNS)
                    Yes?

                                                 JACK
                    My name's Jack. Miss Bryant was my
                    teacher.

                                          (BEAT)
                    I saw her last night.
          Paul looks at Jack coldly for a second.    Then walks away.
          Jack follows him.

                                                JACK
                    I was going past the funeral home. Miss
                    Bryant stood there. In the window. In a
                    red dress.

                                                PAUL

                                          (IRRITATED)
                    Anna doesn't have a red dress.

                                                JACK
                    You think I'm lying.   I'm not lying.
          Paul stops.   Turns to Jack angrily.

                                                PAUL
                    Look...
                           (trying to remember his name)
                    Jack. I'm in no mood--

                                                JACK
                    She needs your help.

                                               PAUL

                                         (SHOUTS)
                    Jack. Anna's dead.
          Paul's words ECHO loudly.   The bustling corridor goes silent.

                                                                    64.

                         

                         

                                                PAUL
                           (almost to himself)
                    I can't help her anymore.
          Paul turns and walks away.    Jack grabs his arm.

                                                JACK
                    Maybe you just don't love her anymore?
          Paul turns and hits Jack with the back of his hand.     Jack
          falls to the ground. Paul stands over him enraged.

                                                PAUL
                    You little fuck. You think this is funny?
          He's about to hit Jack again when a STOCKY TEACHER grabs
          him. Paul tries to struggle loose.

                                                STOCKY TEACHER
                    Hey!
          The CHILDREN stare at Paul. A SECURITY GUARD runs across
          talking into a walkie-talkie. Another TEACHER bends down.

                                                TEACHER
                    Are you alright sweetie?
          Jack nods numbly. Looking up all the time at Paul.      The
          Security Guard grabs Paul's arm.

                                                SECURITY GUARD
                    The police are on their way.
          Paul watches Jack stand shakily.   Realizes what he's
          done. He reaches out to Jack.

                                                PAUL
                    Jack... I'm sorry...

                                                SECURITY GUARD
                    Step back sir.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. SECURITY ROOM - DAY

          Paul sits at a table. Staring blankly at a row of CCTV
          monitors. The door opens. Tom walks in.

                                                TOM
                    You're lucky.

                                                PAUL
                    Am I?

                                                TOM
                    They're not pressing charges.

                                                                         65.

                         

                         
          Paul doesn't look up.     He's miles away.

                                                   TOM
                       What the hell's wrong with you?
                              (holds his fingers close together)
                       You're this close to fucking up your
                       career.

                                                   PAUL
                              (suddenly looks up)
                       You know what he told me? He told me
                       Anna's alive.

                                                   TOM
                       You didn't believe him did you?

                                                    PAUL
                       No.   Of course not.
          Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The
          ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts
          hypnotically across the screen.

                                                   PAUL
                       It's just... I'm having these...

                                                   TOM
                       What?

                                                    PAUL
                       Nothing.   Forget it.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a
          ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves
          Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her
          slab watching Eliot work.

                         ANNA'S POV
          Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face
          partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's
          face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of
          wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.

                                    ANNA (O.C.)
                       What's that for?
          Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He
          leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.

                                                                     66.

                         

                         

                                                 ELIOT
                    His mouth.   To keep it closed.
          Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back
          Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the
          lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He
          picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.

                                                ELIOT
                    Now his eyes.
          He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids
          over them. Glues the eyelids together.

                                                ANNA
                    Is this how you'll prepare my body?
          Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly.

                                               ELIOT
                    No. There's no need. I had to rebuild
                    his face. You're still beautiful.

                                                ANNA
                    Does he have family?

                                                  ELIOT
                    Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later.
          Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.

                                                ANNA
                    My mother... She didn't cry did she?
                    When she came to see me?

                                                ELIOT
                           (shakes his head)
                    I'm sorry.

                                                 ANNA
                    And Paul?

                                                ELIOT
                    It's not important anymore.

                                                ANNA
                    I need to know.

                                                  ELIOT

                                            (HESITATES)
                    No.    He didn't cry.
          We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes.

                                                                      67.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    I knew he wouldn't.     He always got
                    upset when I cried.     He said crying
                    never helped.
          Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily
          against the slab. As if she's about to fall.

                                                ELIOT
                    You should rest.
          He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down.

                                                ELIOT
                    You're getting weaker.    It's almost time.
          Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him.

                                                ANNA
                    Can I ask you something?

                                                 ELIOT
                    Yes.   Of course.

                                                ANNA
                    Why do we die?
          A long beat.

                                                ELIOT
                    To make life important.
          Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable
          child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna
          sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering.
          But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with
          AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently
          in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves
          to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the
          shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

          Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes
          over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a
          ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More
          ominous. Claustrophobic.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back.
          Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in
          thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.

                                                                     68.

                         

                         

                         ON POLAROID
          The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.

                                 ELIOT (O.C.)
                    Mrs. Whitehall. Susan. I hope you found
                    what you were looking for.

                         ROOM
          Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken
          to him.

                                                ELIOT
                    Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No
                    need to apologize.
          Eliot moves over to the wall.

                                                ELIOT
                    I really enjoyed our time together.
          We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an
          OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in
          HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins.
          Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with
          their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot
          touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in
          the Young Man's eyes.

                                   ELIOT (O.C.)
                    Anthony.    Anthony. Always confused.
          Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot
          moves to the window.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR
          parked on the driveway.

                         ELIOT'S ROOM
          Eliot steps back.    Calmly continues to dry his hands.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - DAY

          Eliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway.

                                                ELIOT
                    How can I help you Officer?

                                                OFFICER
                    I'd like to see the body.

                                                                   69.

                         

                         
          Eliot stops.   We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes.

                                                OFFICER
                    Frank Merano. I'm his brother.    Vincent
                    Merano? I called this morning.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Mr. Merano.   Yes. Of course.

                                                VINCENT (OFFICER)
                    I hope it's no trouble. I'd just like to
                    see him before the funeral.
          Eliot glances at his watch.   Smiles at Vincent.

                                                ELIOT
                    It's no trouble at all.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent
          looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her
          shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.

                                                ELIOT
                    Your brother's here.
          Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was
          speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet
          away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.

                                                VINCENT
                    He looks so peaceful. You've done a
                    beautiful job. Thank-you.

                                                ELIOT
                    You should remember him as he used to be.
          Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances
          again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side.
          Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled
          for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.

                                                VINCENT
                    That's the schoolteacher isn't it?
          Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.

                                                ELIOT

                                          (QUICKLY)
                    Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything
                    else I can help you with?
          Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot.

                                                                   70.

                         

                         

                                                  VINCENT
                      Something's not right here.

                                                  ELIOT
                             (looks up sharply)
                      Not right?
          Vincent nods towards Frank's body.

                                                    VINCENT
                      His smile.    It was a bit more...
          Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find
          the right word.

                                                    VINCENT
                      ...smiley.

                                                    ELIOT
                      Smiley.

          ON FRANK'S MOUTH
          Eliot manipulates Frank's lips.

                                   VINCENT (O.C.)
                      A touch more.

                         PREP ROOM

                                                  VINCENT
                      That's much better. Thank-you.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I'm glad I could help.

                                                  VINCENT
                      Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes
                      alone with him?
          Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles.

                                                   ELIOT
                      No.   Not at all. I'll wait outside.
          As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a
          moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He
          quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then
          pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES
          HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body.
          As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against
          the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls
          back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.

                                                    VINCENT
                      I'm sorry.    I didn't see...

                                                                    71.

                         

                         
          Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly
          askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks
          coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence.

                                                  VINCENT
                      Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll
                      see you at the service. Thanks again.
          Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The
          door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I just told you. That was your brother.
                             (turns to Frank)
                      You had an accident. You're dead. Why
                      do you people never listen to me?
          Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut.

                                                   ELIOT
                      No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse.
          Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks
          with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I take care of each of you as if you were
                      my children. I wash the shit from your
                      bodies. I dress you. I do everything to
                      make you look more beautiful than when
                      you were alive. And what do you do?
          Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red
          lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.

                                                  ELIOT
                      You argue with me. As if it were my fault
                      you're dead. As if I was to blame.
                             (slams down the lipstick.)
                      What? You're not talking to me now? You
                      don't want to?

          ON FRANK'S FACE
          The crudely drawn bright red lips.     Clown-like circles of
          rouge. Gaudy and macabre.

                                   ELIOT (O.S.)
                      You don't talk because you have nothing
                      to say. And you have nothing to say
                      because you're a corpse.

                         PREP ROOM
          From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to
          talk again.

                                                                      72.

                         

                         

                                                  ELIOT
                       No. Now I don't want to talk to you
                       anymore.

                         

          INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          The curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless,
          in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway.

                                                   JACK
                       I'm off to school now.
          His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment
          she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

          Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush.
          Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          The service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously
          through the empty room to an open casket. He glances
          back, then leans over the coffin.

                         JACK'S POV
          Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His
          face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches
          into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand.
          In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops
          surprised. Watches Jack intently.

                         ON JACK

                                                   JACK

                                             (TO FRANK)
                       What's it like? Are you afraid?

                                   ELIOT (O.C.)
                       Jack.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Jack turns quickly.    Eliot stands over him.

                                                                  73.

                         

                         

                                                ELIOT
                    You have empathy with the dead. You're
                    drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to
                    you. It's a rare gift.
          Jack can't look Eliot in the eye.

                                                ELIOT
                    I know you saw Anna.
          Jack hesitates.   Then nods his head.

                                                ELIOT
                    You're frightened by it. I was scared
                    too the first time. But you shouldn't
                    be. Christ had the same gift. He raised
                    Lazarus and spoke to the dead.

                                                JACK

                                          (INTRIGUED)
                    You spoke to Miss Bryant?

                                                  ELIOT
                    Yes.

                                                JACK
                    You've spoken to others?

                                                  ELIOT
                    Yes.    Many others.

                                                JACK
                    Who was the first one you spoke to?
          A long beat.

                                                  ELIOT
                    My mother.
          Jack looks up sharply.   Eliot's words have clearly struck a
          chord.

                                                 ELIOT
                    You shouldn't be afraid.

                                          (BEAT)
                    The others. They won't understand.    They
                    don't see what we see.

                                          (BEAT)
                    I can help you. I can teach you.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. Eliot places a bunch
          of tulips on the trolley. Turns on a CD. CLASSICAL MUSIC
          fills the room as before. He moves over to Anna. Gently
          Pulls away the sheet.

                                                                    74.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    Your fingernails are dirty.
          Eliot smiles.    Examines his nails.

                                                ANNA
                    Your hands are normally so clean.

                                                ELIOT
                    I've been gardening.
          He walks over to the sink.      Scrubs his nails.

                                                ANNA
                    Is it sunny outside?
          Eliot fills a bowl with water.     Carries it to the slab.

                                                  ELIOT
                    Yes.    The tulips love the sun.

                                                ANNA
                    I miss the sun.
          Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on
          his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the
          bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.

                                                ANNA
                    Are they your favorite flower?

                                                  ELIOT
                    Tulips?    Yes. I think so.
          Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit.
          Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.

                                                ANNA
                    I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies.
                    Don't they symbolize death?

                                                  ELIOT
                    No.    They symbolize purity.
          He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her
          body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.

                                                  ANNA
                    And tulips?
          Eliot hesitates for a second before replying.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Unrequited love.

                                          (BEAT)
                    What's your favorite flower?

                                                                         75.

                         

                         

                                                  ANNA
                    Violets.
          Eliot softly washes her legs.

                                                ELIOT
                    A beautiful flower.       They need shade and
                    lots of water.

                                                ANNA
                    What do they symbolize?

                                                ELIOT
                    Faithfulness.

                                                ANNA

                                          (DISTRACTEDLY)
                    Do they?
          Eliot puts down the sponge.      Dries her body with a towel.

                                                ANNA
                    Roses are red, violets are blue...
          He reaches over to the CD player to switch it off.

                                                   ANNA
                    No.     Leave it on.    It's so peaceful.
          Eliot smiles.   Leaves the music on.

                         

          INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. STREETS - DAY

          Paul drives aimlessly past strip malls. He stops at a
          red light. Lights a cigarette. Just then he notices
          something across the street. He looks puzzled.

                         

          EXT. STREET/STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

          Paul gets out of his car.    Quickly walks over to the
          store window.

          ON STORE WINDOW
          A RED-SLIP on a mannequin.       Just like ANNA'S RED SLIP.

                         STREET
          The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily.
          Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the
          plate glass. Stunned.

                                                                  76.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

          Eliot prunes a low hedge by the front door.

                                  PAUL (O.C.)
                    Deane.
          Eliot turns.   Paul's clearly agitated.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Mr. Conran.   A pleasure.
          Eliot stands stiffly.   Rubs his back.

                                                ELIOT
                    I love gardening, but I'm not sure
                    gardening loves me anymore.

                                                PAUL
                    She's not dead is she?

                                                ELIOT

                                          (AMUSED)
                    Mr. Conran.

                                                PAUL
                    Someone saw her.

                                                 ELIOT
                    I'm sorry?

                                                PAUL
                    One of Anna's students.
                           (nods towards the funeral home)
                    In the window.

                                                ELIOT
                    Do you mean Jack?
          Paul's momentarily taken aback.

                                                PAUL
                    You know him?

                                                ELIOT
                    Of course I know him. He's often round
                    here. He seems to have a strange
                    fascination with death. He's eleven
                    years old Mr. Conran. And like all young
                    boys has a vivid imagination. Now if
                    you'll excuse me--

                                                PAUL
                    I don't think he imagined it.   I think he
                    really saw her.

                                                                    77.

                         

                         

                                                ELIOT
                    Maybe you just want to believe he saw her.

                                                  PAUL
                    Fuck you.
          Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home.

                                                  ELIOT
                    Mr. Conran!

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul moves quickly through the hallway.

                                                  PAUL

                                            (SHOUTS)
                    Anna!
          Eliot calmly heads towards Paul.

                                                ELIOT
                    Mr. Conran. I think you should leave
                    before I call the police.
          Paul notices the stairs leading down to the Prep Room.

                                                PAUL
                    What's down there?

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul runs over to the Prep Room door. He grabs the handle.
          It's locked. Eliot appears behind him. Paul turns.

                                                PAUL
                    She's in here isn't she?     Give me the
                    key.
          Eliot stares at Paul with pity.

                                                PAUL
                    Give me the fucking key.
          Paul turns back.   POUNDS the door in rage.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          The POUNDING echoes through the room. Anna awkwardly
          sits up. Struggling with her emotions. She wants to
          call out but knows she has to let Paul go.

                                   PAUL (O.S.)
                    Anna!

                                                                      78.

                         

                         
          Anna gets up.   Hesitates.   Weakly stumbles to the door.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME


                                                PAUL
                    I'm here Anna.

                                          (DESPERATE)
                    I'm sorry. Please Anna.
          He places the palm of his hand against the door.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna places her palm against the door. As if touching
          Paul's hand. A tear falls down her cheek.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                    We'll be happy again. I promise.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME


                                                PAUL
                    I can't live without you.
          Eliot looks up at Paul with sudden interest.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna shakes her head. Takes her hand away from the door.
          Walks back to her slab.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME


                                                 PAUL
                    Anna!
          Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul's shoulder.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Mr. Conran.   She's dead.
          Paul pushes him away.

                                                ELIOT
                    I know what you're going through.
                    Denial's a natural part of grieving...

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna lies down on the slab. Closes her eyes.     ELIOT'S
          VOICE seems far away now. Receding.

                                                                      79.

                         

                         

                                    ELIOT (O.S.)
                       ...but you've got to accept she's gone.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS


                                                   PAUL
                       She needs my help.
          Eliot looks at him for a moment.

                                                   ELIOT
                       You can't help her anymore.    Believe me.

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

          An open plan office. Paul weaves quickly through the
          rows of desks. He seems unbalanced. Manic. DETECTIVES
          cautiously watch Paul approach Tom sitting at his desk,
          his head bent over paperwork.

                                                   PAUL
                       I need you to issue a search warrant.
          Tom looks up.       He's shocked by Paul's appearance.

                                                   PAUL

                                             (LOUDLY)
                       I need a fucking search warrant.    Now are
                       you going to help me or what?
          JEFF (20s) a Young Detective at a nearby desk stands.
          Tom nods to him. It's under control.

                                                     TOM
                       Paul.    Sit down.
          Paul hesitates for a second.

                                                     TOM

                                               (FIRMLY)
                       Sit.    Down.
          Paul sits.    Tom leans forward.    He's not amused.

                                                   TOM
                       Just what the hell do you think you're
                       doing? I got a call from Eliot Deane.
                       Are you out of your fucking mind?

                                                   PAUL
                       Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see
                       her. He's keeping her there--

                                                                    80.

                         

                         

                                                TOM
                    Anna was in a car accident. Her car was
                    wrecked Paul. Remember? It's downstairs.

                                                PAUL
                    She's not dead.
          Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet.   Takes
          out a file. Hands it to Paul.

                                                TOM
                    Here's the Coroner's report.
          Paul manically rifles through the file.

                                                   PAUL
                    Look.
                           (shows file to Tom)
                    The paramedics phoned it in. They only
                    checked for eye dilation and pulse. The
                    doctor signed the death certificate
                    without even seeing her body.

                                                 TOM

                                           (IRRITATED)
                    So?   That's standard procedure.

                                                PAUL
                    There was no EEG. Nothing. He could
                    have drugged her to make it look like she
                    was dead.

                                                   TOM
                    Drugged her?     Are you serious?
          Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk.

                                                JEFF
                    There are drugs like that chief.
                    Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis
                    within seconds. The heartbeat slows to
                    almost nothing.
          Tom shoots Jeff a look.

                                                PAUL
                    See? I'm telling you. She's not dead.
                    The boy at school. Jack. He saw her.

                                    VINCENT (O.C.)
                    I saw her.
          Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him.
          Vincent Merano stands by Jeff's desk.

                                                VINCENT
                    She was on the slab.     Dead.

                                                                    81.

                         

                         

                                                   PAUL
                    No!

                                                VINCENT
                    I've seen dead bodies.       Believe me, she
                    was definitely dead.

                                               PAUL
                    Tom. Just go down there and check the
                    place out.

                                                TOM
                    On what grounds Paul?       Do you have any
                    evidence?

                                                   PAUL
                    No.     But--

                                                TOM
                    Do you have anything?
          Paul hesitates.    We sense his uncertainty.

                                                PAUL
                    I think she called me.

                                                   TOM
                    Called you?

                                                PAUL

                                          (WEAKLY)
                    On the telephone.
          Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd
          this all sounds.

                                                VINCENT
                    Collect or long distance?
          Jeff snorts with laughter.

                                                TOM
                    First you hit a fucking kid. Then you
                    attack Deane. And now you're telling me
                    your dead girlfriend called you? What the
                    fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul.
          Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if
          he were crazy. Tom's voice softens.

                                                TOM
                    I know you feel guilty but you've got to
                    pull yourself together.
          Paul slumps in the chair.       Rubs his face.

                                                                   82.

                         

                         

                                                PAUL
                    Maybe you're right.    But why won't he let
                    me see her?
          Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his
          desk. Jeff turns back to his work.

                                                TOM
                    Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow.
                    You'll see her then. It'll help. It
                    will give you closure. Trust me.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

          The sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to
          himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like
          everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over
          Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure.
          For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is.

                                                JACK
                    You said you could teach me.
          Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave.
          Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him.

                                                ELIOT
                    It's only a hole in the ground.   I'm
                    digging it for--

                                                  JACK
                    Miss Bryant.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Exactly.   For Anna.   She belongs here.

                                                JACK
                    Because she's dead.

                                                 ELIOT
                    No.   Because there's no life left in her.
          Jack carefully considers Eliot's words.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm
                    the only one who can see all these
                    corpses. Wandering the earth
                    aimlessly. All they do is piss and
                    shit. Suffocating us with their
                    stench. Doing nothing with their
                    lives. Taking the air away from those
                    who actually want to live. I have to
                    bury them all. I have no choice.

                                          (BEAT)
                    Now there's two of us.

                                                                    83.

                         

                         
          Eliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a
          moment then reaches for the shovel.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING

          Anna watches Eliot brush an invisible speck off her
          mother's black dress.

                                                ELIOT
                    You did well this morning.

                                                ANNA
                    This morning?
          She talks with difficulty now. Her voice SLURRED and
          HOARSE. Her words muddled and rambling. Her eyes even
          more sunken. Her skin even more pale.

                                                ELIOT
                    When Paul came. You did the right thing.
                    You let him go.

                                                ANNA
                    He'll be all right now?    Won't he?
          Eliot looks away. Doesn't reply. He drapes the dress
          over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and
          moves over to her.

                                                ANNA

                                          (CONFUSED)
                    Why do I have to get dressed?

                                                ELIOT
                    Tomorrow's your funeral.
          Eliot lifts Anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves
          of the dress. Her body's stiff and unyielding.

                                                 ANNA
                    Already?

                                                 ELIOT
                    I told you.   You only had three days.
          He delicately turns her onto her side.    Buttons up the dress.

                                                ELIOT
                    I told you to use your time well.
          Anna frowns. As if trying to remember something. Eliot
          gently lifts her legs. Pulls on a pair of black tights.

                                                ANNA
                    I need to... I have so many regrets.     I
                    have nothing but regrets.

                                                                     84.

                         

                         
          She looks up at him.   Suddenly realizing.

                                                ANNA
                    That's why I'm here isn't it?      To be
                    judged.
          Eliot picks up Anna's shoes.   Slips them onto her stiff feet.

                                                ELIOT
                    You're here to understand your life.       So
                    you can finally be at peace.

                                                ANNA
                    I wanted a different life.
          Eliot picks up a nail-clipper. Gently holds Anna's hand
          as he carefully cuts her long nails.

                                                ELIOT
                    Then why didn't you do anything about it?

                                                ANNA
                    No matter what I did everything just
                    stayed the same. I'd wake up. I'd
                    shower. Sit in the same traffic
                    everyday on my way to work. Go home.
                    Go to sleep. Then wake again.
          Eliot stops clipping her nails.   Irritated.

                                                ELIOT
                    What did you really want from life?

                                                ANNA
                    I just wanted to be happy.

                                                ELIOT

                                          (DERISIVELY)
                    Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy.
                    What does it mean Anna? To be happy?

                                                ANNA
                    I don't know. Don't you understand?
                    That's the whole point. I don't know.

                                                ELIOT
                    Yes you do! You're just too scared to
                    admit it to yourself.
          Anna turns away ashamed.   She knows he's right.

                                                ANNA
                    I don't want to talk about it anymore.      I
                    just want this to be over.

                                                ELIOT
                    What did you want from life?

                                                                      85.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA
                    I don't fucking know!

                                                ELIOT

                    WHAT DID YOU WANT ANNA?

                                                ANNA

                                          (SCREAMS BACK)

                    I WANTED LOVE! OK!
          Anna's stunned.   She's finally admitted it.

                                                ANNA

                                          (QUIETLY)
                    I wanted love.

                                                ELIOT
                    You had love. Paul loved you.

                                                 ANNA
                    No. You don't understand. I was scared.
                    I wanted to love but I didn't know how.
                    I was...

                                          (BEAT)
                    When I was a child... my mother.
          Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts.

                                                ANNA
                    When I was a child. I learnt that love.
                    That when you love someone. You get
                    hurt. So I learned not to love. That
                    way no one could ever hurt me again.
          She looks down at the slab.     Touches the cold marble.

                                                ANNA
                    I was always pushing Paul away.      He
                    thought I didn't love him.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Did you?

                                                ANNA
                    He was the only one I ever loved. But I
                    never told him that. And then he stopped
                    loving me.
          Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision.

                                                ELIOT
                    What would you do if you had another
                    chance?
          Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it.
          Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold
          light. Anna doesn't move.

                                                                     86.

                         

                         

                                                 ELIOT
                    Well?   Isn't this what you wanted?
          Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and
          rises from the slab.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

          Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the
          driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress
          and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.

                         

          EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Anna approaches her mother's house.    Paul opens the door.
          He's not surprised to see her.
          Beatrice stands just behind him.     A black shawl over her
          head and arms.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD
          WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical
          black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in
          different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like
          an ANCIENT PRAYER.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down
          we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly
          flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily.
          The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning
          over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell
          their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER.
          Through the chaos of words we begin to make out...

                                                  OLD WOMEN
                    Spit it out.
          Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her
          mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING.

                                                  OLD WOMEN
                    Spit it out.
          Anna spits out... white maggots.     She gags again.   Closes
          her eyes. Shakes her head.

                                                  ANNA
                    No.

                                                                   87.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

          Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room.
          She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.

                                                ELIOT
                    I thought you were different. You all
                    say you're scared of death. But the
                    truth is you're more scared of life.
          Eliot switches off the lights.

                                 ANNA (O.C.)
                    I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over.

                         

          EXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

          Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as
          he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's
          room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out
          of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home.
          It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the
          wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.
          He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge.
          Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches
          down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.

          FROM THE BUSHES
          Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.

                         FUNERAL HOME
          Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's
          caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly.
          A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.

                                                MAN'S VOICE
                    What the fuck are you doing here?
          The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom.

                                                TOM
                    I'm taking you home.

                         

          EXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON black earth.   A trowel digs into the soil.

                                                                   88.

                         

                         
          We pull back. Jack's just finished digging a hole in the
          flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid.
          The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly
          replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He
          pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the
          faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.

                                                 JACK
                     Don't be scared. It's better this way.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAWN

          Eliot lies on his bed. Dressed in a dark suit. He hasn't
          slept at all. His eyes rimmed red. He checks the clock on
          the bedside table. It's 4.30am. He glances to the
          window. Dawn light seeps into the room.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAWN

          Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters
          in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still
          covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the
          delicate flowers.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAWN

          Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress.   Her eyes closed.
          Eliot enters the room. He doesn't lock the door behind
          him. Doesn't turn the lights on. Doesn't change into
          his mortician smock.
          He approaches the slab. The violets in his hand. Pulls
          over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets
          on the steel trolley beside her.
          He looks at her intently. For the first time he seems
          uncertain. Vulnerable. As if questioning himself.
          After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the
          door. He's about to close the door behind him...

                                  ANNA (O.C.)
                     I don't even know your name.

                         ON ANNA
          Her eyes still closed.

                         ON ELIOT
          Eliot pauses.   Too confused to look back at her.

                                                                    89.

                         

                         

                                                    ELIOT
                       It's...

                                             (BEAT)
                       It's not important.
          He closes the door.

                         

          INT. BEATRICE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY

          CLOSE ON Beatrice's face.    Her eyes closed.
          A HAND delicately powders her forehead. As if she's
          being prepared for her own funeral. We pull back.
          Beatrice, dressed in black, sits in front of a mirror.
          Diane applies her make-up. Beatrice opens her eyes.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Paul, badly shaven, leans against the washbasin. Wearing
          a crumpled black suit. Staring vacantly in the mirror.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Anna lies in a casket as Eliot arranges her hair.

                                                   ELIOT

                                             (GENTLY)
                       It's time now.
          She looks up smiling. Eliot positions her hands,
          entwining her fingers.

                                                   ELIOT
                       You have to look beautiful for your
                       funeral.
          He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID.
          Fills the syringe.

                         ON AMPOULE
          We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.

                                    ELIOT (O.C.)
                       This will relax your muscles. Make your
                       skin radiant. As if you were still
                       alive. Just sleeping.

                         PREP ROOM

                                                   ELIOT
                       This is how they'll all remember you.

                                                                      90.

                         

                         

                                                   ANNA
                       Can I see myself for the last time?
          Eliot smiles.    Picks up a mirror.    Hands it to Anna.

                         ON MIRROR
          Anna looks peaceful.    Beautiful.    Serene.

                                                   ANNA
                       Is this the end?

                                    ELIOT (O.C.)
                       The last part is the most difficult.
                       You'll have to face it alone. But you'll
                       be at peace soon.
          Anna nods.    SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror.
          She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on
          the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror, then at Anna.

                                                   ANNA
                       You lied to me.

                                                   ELIOT
                       Anna. We've been through this before.
                       You're just imagining--

                                                   ANNA
                       You lied to me.
          Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to
          raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.

                                    ELIOT (O.C.)
                       You're still clutching onto life. Don't
                       give in to your fears. You're so close.
          Anna's fading away.    Her hand drops limply to her side.

                                                   ANNA

                                             (WHISPERS)
                       Why did you lie to me?
          She stops struggling.    Stares blankly at us.
          Eliot looks at her for   a moment. Sadly. Regretfully.
          He picks up a Polaroid   camera. The flash explodes in a
          blinding white light.    He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels
          off the front and fans   it in the air. Then...

                                                                     91.

                         

                         

                         ON ANNA
          ...delicately closes Anna's eyelids.

                                   ELIOT (O.C.)
                      Good bye Anna.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

          Anna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her
          casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies.
          Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane
          beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack
          and other CHILDREN.

                                   FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)
                      I am the resurrection and the life.
                      Those who believe in me, even though they
                      die, will live.
          Tom and Paul appear at the door.   Tom guides Paul to a
          seat near the back.

                                   FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)
                      They that sleep in the earth will awake
                      and shout for joy; and the earth will
                      bring those long dead to birth again.

                         ON CASKET
          Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed.     She can
          hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.

                                   FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)
                      We have come here today to remember
                      before God our sister Anna. To give
                      thanks for her life.

          ON ANNA'S FACE
          We see an almost imperceptible frown.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket.
          Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the
          violets in Anna's hands.

                                                  DIANE
                      Violets. They were her favorite flowers.
                             (turns to Eliot)
                      How did you know?

                                                  ELIOT
                      Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.

                                                                      92.

                         

                         
          Next we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He
          stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the
          Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin.

                         PAUL'S POV
          Anna looks serene.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently
          slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger.
          Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.

                                                   TOM

                                             (WHISPERS)
                       What is it?

                                                   PAUL
                       She's so cold.
          Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes. He
          touches her cheek again.    Finally accepting her death.

                                                   PAUL
                       I'm sorry Anna.
          He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's
          almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look
          then turns and stares at Paul.
          As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket.
          Begins to screw down the lid.

                         

          INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

          It's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING.      Anna's eyes
          FLICKER OPEN then close again.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIME

          Just then Paul turns back sharply.      As if he sensed
          Anna's reaction inside the casket.      Tom gently stops him.

                                                   TOM
                              (shakes his head)
                       She's at peace now.
          Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows
          Tom to lead him away.
          Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room.
          Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger.

                                                                    93.

                         

                         

                         ON COFFIN
          A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a
          pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the
          blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.

                                                  ELIOT

                                            (SOFTLY)
                      Don't be scared. It's better this way.
          Eliot turns.   Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOON

          The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open
          grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.

                         

          INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

          Anna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out.
          But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - SAME TIME

          The TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin.
          Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could
          sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.

                                   FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.)
                      We have but a short time to live. Like a
                      flower we blossom and then wither. In
                      the midst of life we are in death.

                         

          INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

          Blackness. Earth CLATTERS HEAVILY onto the wooden lid.
          Anna GASPS softly. Hyperventilating. The earth keeps
          falling. The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful.
          She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATER

          The grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles
          flicker on top. In the b.g. MOURNERS head to their cars.
          Paul and Tom stand by the grave.

                                                  TOM
                      You sure you're going to be OK?

                                                                   94.

                         

                         

                                                 PAUL
                    Yeah.   Thanks Tom.
          Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - SAME TIME

          Eliot carefully pins Anna's Polaroid to the wall.

                         ON POLAROIDS
          We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before.
          But now we look at them differently. In some faces there
          is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading
          look. In others passive resignation.

                         ELIOT'S ROOM
          Eliot moves towards the window.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles
          illuminate Anna's grave.

                                 ELIOT (O.C.)
                    Imagine Anna. The whole world, your
                    mother, your fiancée, your friends.
                    Everyone has buried you. They've placed
                    a stone above your body.

                         ELIOT'S ROOM

                                                ELIOT
                    They've said their good byes and gone
                    back to their TV dinners and shopping
                    malls. Thinking that this is never going
                    to happen to them. Until it's their turn
                    to be buried. Think about it Anna...
          Eliot glances at his watch.

                                                ELIOT
                    ...think about it while you still can.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul unlocks his car. He's about to open the car door
          when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack's
          observing him carefully.

                                                PAUL
                    You said she was alive.

                                                                       95.

                         

                         

                                                   JACK
                       I never said she was alive.     I just said
                       I saw her.
          Paul simply nods his head.        Too drained of emotion to react.

                                                   PAUL
                       You need a ride?
          Jack shakes his head.

                                                    PAUL
                       OK.   See you.
          Paul opens the car door.

                                                   JACK
                       Mr. Conran?

                                             (PAUL TURNS)
                       Don't forget to fasten your seat belt.
          Paul nods. Gets in his car.        Jack looks up at the
          Funeral Home.

                         JACK'S POV
          Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          We're at Anna's wake.      PEOPLE talk quietly in small groups.
          Paul fills a glass with whiskey. Knocks it back in one.
          PEOPLE stare disapprovingly. WHISPERING to each other.

                                    ELIOT (O.C.)
                       Don't you think you've had enough to
                       drink?
          Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him.        Paul pours himself
          another drink.

                                                    PAUL
                       Go to hell.
          An ELDERLY COUPLE shake their heads and walk away.

                                                   ELIOT

                                             (AMUSED)
                       Mr. Conran. We're at a wake.      You should
                       show more respect.

                                                   PAUL
                       I know she wasn't dead.

                                                                    96.

                         

                         

                                                   ELIOT
                    Wasn't she?
          Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations.

                                                ELIOT
                    Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral
                    Home, making wild accusations. You have
                    no idea what happens when someone dies.
                    What happens to their body. What
                    happens to their soul.

                                          (TAUNTING)
                    You think Anna was alive after the
                    accident? Maybe you're right.
          Paul's stunned.

                                                ELIOT
                    Maybe she's still alive. You obviously
                    don't believe a word I say. So why don't
                    you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran.
                    Find out whether she's alive or dead.
          Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels.   Shoves him against the wall.

                                                PAUL

                                          (LOUDLY)
                    You twisted fuck.
          The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot
          whispers in Paul's ear.

                                                ELIOT
                    You don't have much time left.
          Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.

                                                 FATHER GRAHAM
                    Please.   Paul. You're not well.
          Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly.
          Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out.

                         

          EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Paul sprints across the lawn to his car.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S CAR - NIGHT

          Paul slips his key into the ignition.   His hand's shaking.

                         

          EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Eliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF.

                                                                        97.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

          We can't see a thing. But we can hear Anna's SHORT
          SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately
          SCRATCHING at the coffin lid.

                         

          INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. ROAD - NIGHT

          Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as
          he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a
          slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.

                                                  PAUL
                     Come on.   Come on.
          He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind
          curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner.
          A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's
          momentarily blinded.

                                           THE SCREEN FLASHES TO WHITE.
          Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any
          traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago.
          Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the
          car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.

          ON REARVIEW MIRROR
          An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.     Blasts past.

                         CAR
          Paul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He
          frowns. Where did the ambulance go?

                         UP AHEAD
          We see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight.
          The cemetery next to it.

                         

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          Eliot's White Van sits by the side of the road.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Paul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the
          distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.

                                                                     98.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then
          the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes
          away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.
          Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody.
          Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her
          body slumps limply like a rag doll.

                                                 PAUL
                    Anna.   I'm here. Please God.     Anna.
          He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life
          left in her. He's about to give up when...
          Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.
          Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.

                                                ANNA
                    Paul?

                                                 PAUL
                    Baby.   Thank God.
          Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round.
          Dazed. Turns back to Paul.

                                                ANNA
                    You came back for me.

                                                PAUL
                    I came back for you.     You're safe now.

                                                ANNA
                    Promise?

                                                PAUL

                                          (SMILES)
                    Promise.
          Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He
          turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's
          something unnerving about the silence.
          Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.
          Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the
          dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.

                                                PAUL
                    Anna?
          Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone
          crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.

                                                                       99.

                         

                         

                                                  PAUL
                    Anna!
          Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.
          Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees
          appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his
          jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on
          Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.

                         

          INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. ROAD - NIGHT

          We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.
          Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC
          fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Paul frantically runs into the parking lot.    Still
          calling out for Anna.

                                                  PAUL
                    Anna!
          Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on.    Paul
          looks at the car nervously.
          He heads over to it.   Apprehensive.   Then... the car door
          slowly CLICKS open.
          Paul stops.   Stares into the car.   There's no one there.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Through the windshield we see Paul approach the car.
          He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he
          switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly
          around him revealing...
          ... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.

                                                ANNA
                    Are we going home?
          Paul turns sharply.    Stunned.   Anna moves towards him.

                                                ANNA
                    Or do you want to make love here?

                                                PAUL
                    Where did you go?
          Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on.
          We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.

                                                                  100.

                         

                         

                                                ANNA

                                          (WHISPERS)
                    I've been waiting for you.    I missed you
                    so much.
          A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his
          lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A
          drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls
          like a flower. Spreading out over the material.

                                                 ANNA
                    I love you.   I always did.
          Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately.
          Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.

                                                PAUL

                                          (ALARMED)
                    What was that?
          Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.

                                                ANNA
                    It's only the scissors...
          We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.    Anna's just
          interested in his lips.

                                                 PAUL
                    Scissors?   What scissors?

                                                ANNA
                    Scissors. For your clothes.    Eliot just
                    put them on the table.
          Paul pulls back.   Terrified.

                                                ANNA
                    You're safe now. We're finally together.
          A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like
          the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.

                                          FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.
          Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light.
          Slowly the room comes into focus...

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

          Eliot stands over Paul holding a pair of BLOODY SCISSORS.
          Paul looks down. His white shirt soaked with blood, the
          material sliced open.

                                                 PAUL
                    Where am I?

                                                                     101.

                         

                         
          He talks with difficulty.   His breath labored.

                                                 ELIOT
                    You're in a funeral home.

                                          (BEAT)
                    You're dead.

                                                PAUL
                    I'm not dead.
          Jack appears at Eliot's side.

                                                ELIOT
                    You had a car accident. You swerved off
                    the road. On the way to the cemetery.
                    Hit a tree.

                                                  PAUL
                    I saw Anna.    You buried her alive.

                                                ELIOT
                    I'm sorry Mr. Conran. You never made it
                    to the cemetery. You never saw Anna.
                    You're dead.
          Paul's glazed eyes widen in shock.

                                                PAUL
                    I'm not dead.
          Eliot speaks calmly.    Soothingly.

                                                ELIOT
                    Your skull was crushed. Your spinal cord
                    pulverized. Your brain cells are slowly
                    dying. Your body's already decomposing.

                                                PAUL
                    I'm not dead.
          Eliot sighs wearily.    He's had this conversation many
          times before.

                                                  ELIOT
                    You people.    You all say the same thing.
          Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further
          away. Paul closes his eyes.

                                           FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                    I'm not dead.

                                                            FADE OUT.

                Story by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett


                      Screenplay by Dan O'Bannon





                                                                       1976






                              SYNOPSIS

     En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

     FADE IN:

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital
     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.

     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic
     machinery chuckles softly to itself.

     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.
     Circuits close, lights blink on.

     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the
     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:

     INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT

     A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with
     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.

     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER
     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.

     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the
     freezers pop open.

     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.

                              ROBY
               Oh... God... am I cold... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Is that you, Roby?

                              ROBY
               I feel like shit... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, it's you all right.

     Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.

                              FAUST
                    (groans)
               Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.

                              BROUSSARD
               You look dead.

                              MELKONIS
               The vampires rise from their graves.

     This draws a few woozy chuckles.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (shakes his fist in the
                     air triumphantly)
               We made it!

                              HUNTER
                    (not fully awake)
               Is it over?

                              STANDARD
               It's over, Hunter.

                              HUNTER
                    (yawning)
               Boy, that's terrific.

                              STANDARD
                    (looking around with a grin)
               Well, how does it feel to be rich
               men?

                              FAUST
               Cold!

     This draws a LAUGH.

                              STANDARD
               Okay!  Everybody topside!  Let's get
               our pants on and get to our posts!

     The men begin to swing out of the freezers.

                              MELKONIS
               Somebody get the cat.

     Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.  There
     are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by
     viewscreens, all blank for the moment.

     There are seats for four men.  Each chair faces a console and is
     surrounded by a dazzling array of technology.

     STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their
     seats.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.

                              ROBY
                    (putting down the cat)
               Cattle ranch!

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm not kidding.  You can get one if
               you have the credit.  Look just like
               real cows, too.

                              STANDARD
               All right, tycoons, let's stop
               spending our credit and start
               worrying about the job at hand.

                              ROBY
               Right.  Fire up all systems.

     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control
     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights
     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills
     with the hum and chatter of machinery.

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, you want to give us some
               vision?

                              MELKONIS
               Feast your eyes.

     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The
     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.

     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (after a pause)
               Where's Irth?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, scan the whole sky.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a
     starfield.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,
     turning silently on its base.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on
     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.

     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
     "SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
     background of glimmering stars.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, contact traffic control.

     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.

                              MELKONIS
               This is deep space commercial vessel
               SNARK, registration number E180246,
               calling Antarctica air traffic
               control.  Do you read me?  Over.

     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (staring at a screen)
               I don't recognize that constellation.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, plot our location.

     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               I got it.  Oh boy.

                              STANDARD
               Where the hell are we?

                              BROUSSARD
               Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We
               haven't even reached the outer rim
               yet.

                              ROBY
               What the hell?

     Standard picks up a microphone.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we
               are not home.  Our present location
               seems to be only halfway to Irth.
               Remain at your posts and stand by.
               That is all.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, I've got something here on my
               security alert.  A high priority from
               the computer... 

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons)
               Computer, you have signalled a
               priority three message.  What is the
               message?

                              COMPUTER
                    (a mechanical voice)
               I have interrupted the course of the
               voyage.

                              ROBY
               What?  Why?

                              COMPUTER
               I am programmed to do so if certain
               conditions arise.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, this is Captain Standard.
               What conditions are you talking
               about?

                              COMPUTER
               I have intercepted a transmission of
               unknown origin.

                              STANDARD
               A transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               A voice transmission.

                              MELKONIS
               Out here?

     The men exchange glances.

                              COMPUTER
               I have recorded the transmission.

                              STANDARD
               Play it for us, please.

     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A
     STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN
     LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls
     silent.

     The men all stare at each other in amazement.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what language was that?

                              COMPUTER
               Unknown.

                              ROBY
               Unknown!  What do you mean?

                              COMPUTER
               It is none of the 678 dialects
               spoken by technological man.

     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.

                              STANDARD
                    (silencing them)
               Just hold it, hold it!
                    (glares around the room)
               Computer: have you attempted to
               analyze the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               Yes.  There are two points of salient
               interest.  Number one: it is highly
               systematized, indicating intelligent
               origin.  Number two: certain sounds
               are inconsistent with the human
               palate.

                              ROBY
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Well, it's finally happened.

                              MELKONIS
               First contact... 

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, can you home in on that beam?

                              MELKONIS
               What's the frequency?

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what's the frequency of
               the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               65330 dash 99.

     Melkonis punches buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got it.  It's coming from
               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,
               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

                              STANDARD
               Dell -- show me that on a screen.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll give it to you on number four.

     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a
     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               That's it.  Let me straighten it out.

     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in
     the center.

                              STANDARD
               Can you get it a little closer?

                              BROUSSARD
               That's what I'm going to do.

     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.

                              MELKONIS
               It's tiny!

                              STANDARD
               Any rotation?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah.  Two hours.

                              STANDARD
               Gravity?

                              BROUSSARD
               Point eight six.  We can walk on it.

     Standard rises.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, get the others up to the
               lounge.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and
     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.

                              MELKONIS
               If it's an S.O.S., we're morally
               obligated to investigate.

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

                              HUNTER
               I don't know.  Seems to me we came on
               this trip to make some credit, not
               to go off on some kind of side trip.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (excited)
               Forget the credit; what we have here
               is a chance to be the first men to
               contact a nonhuman intelligence.

                              ROBY
               If there is some kind of alien
               intelligence down on that planetoid,
               it'd be a serious mistake for us to
               blunder in unequipped.

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, we're equipped --

                              ROBY
               Hell, no!  We don't know what's down
               there on that piece of rock!  It
               might be dangerous!  What we should
               do is get on the radio to the
               exploration authorities... and let
               them deal with it.

                              STANDARD
               Except it will take 75 years to get
               a reply back.  Don't forget how far
               we are from the Colonies, Martin.

                              BROUSSARD
               There are no commercial lanes out
               here.  Face it, we're out of range.

                              MELKONIS
               Men have waited centuries to contact
               another form of intelligent life in
               the universe.  This is an opportunity
               which may never come again.

                              ROBY
               Look --

                              STANDARD
               You're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen
               -- let's go.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, I want greater magnification.
               More surface detail.  I want to see
               what this place looks like.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll see what I can do.

     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE
     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.

                              STANDARD
               It's out of focus.

                              ROBY
               No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud
               layer.

                              MELKONIS
               My God, it's stormy for a piece of
               rock that size!

                              ROBY
               Just a second.
                    (punches buttons)
               Those aren't water vapor clouds;
               they have no moisture content.

                              STANDARD
               Put ship in atmospheric mode.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - OUTER SPACE

     The great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main body
     of the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assumed
     an aerodynamic form.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Dell, set a course and bring us in
               on that beam.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the
     distant dot that is the planetoid.

     CAMERA APPROACHES THE PLANETOID, until it looms large on screen.  It is
     turbulent, completely enveloped in dun-colored clouds.

     The SNARK drops down toward the surface.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Activate lifter quads.

                              BROUSSARD
               Activated.  Vertical drop checked.
               Correcting course.  On tangential
               course now, orbiting.
                    (brief pause as he
                     studies his instruments)
               Crossing the terminator.  Entering
               night side.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - IN ORBIT

     Beneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet.

     Descending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmosphere
     of the planetoid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.

                              STANDARD
               Turn on navigation lights.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK"

     Hydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brilliant
     lights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improving
     visibility.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               Approaching point of origin.  Closing
               at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing.
               Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are
               directly above the source of the
               transmission.

                              STANDARD
               What's the terrain down there?

                              BROUSSARD
               Well, line of sight is impossible
               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.
               Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared --
               noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There.
               Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.

                              STANDARD
               Is it solid?

                              BROUSSARD
               It's... basalt.  Rock.

                              STANDARD
               Then take her down.

                              BROUSSARD
               Drop begins... now!  Fifteen
               kilometers and dropping... twelve... 
               ten... eight and slowing.  Five.
               Three.  Two.  One kilometer and
               slowing.  Lock tractor beams.

     There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.

                              ROBY
               Locked.

                              BROUSSARD
               Kill drive engines.

     The engines fall silent.

                              ROBY
               Engines off.

                              BROUSSARD
               Nine hundred meters and dropping.
               800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers
     above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.

     Landing struts unfold like insect legs.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               And we're... down.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the
     panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.

                              BROUSSARD
               Jesus Christ!

     The lights come back on again.

                              STANDARD
               What the hell happened?

                              ROBY
                    (hits a switch)
               Engine room, what happened?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Just a minute, hold it, I'm
               checking.

                              ROBY
               Has the hull been breached?

                              BROUSSARD
               Uh... 
                    (scans his gauges)
               No, I don't see anything.  We've
               still got pressure.

     There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then:

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are
               clogged with dust.  We overheated and
               burned out a whole cell.

                              STANDARD
                    (strikes his panel)
               Damn it!  How long to fix?

                              ROBY
                    (into microphone)
               How long to fix?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Hard to say.

                              ROBY
               Well, get started.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Right.  Talk to you.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take a look outside.  Turn the
               screens back on.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black.

                              BROUSSARD
               Can't see a blessed thing.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute
     darkness around it.

     THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING
     LIGHTS.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              STANDARD
               Kick on the floods.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     A ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light
     out into the night.

     They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and
     clouds of blowing dust.  The wind shrieks.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
               Not much help.

     Standard stares at the dark screens.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we can't go anywhere in this
               darkness.  How long till dawn?

                              MELKONIS
                    (consults his instruments)
               Well... this rock rotates every two
               hours.  The sun should be coming up
               in about 20 minutes.

                              BROUSSARD
               Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see
               something then.

                              ROBY
               Or something will be able to see us.

     They all look at him.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT (MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE)

     The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the
     darkness and the storm.  MAIN THEME MUSIC BEGINS, EXTREMELY OMINOUS.

     THE TITLE APPEARS:

                              ALIEN

     RUN TITLES.

     Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.  The
     silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect
     crouching motionless on the barren plain.  The floods shut off.  Dense
     clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and
     reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.

     END MAIN TITLES.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange
     dust.

     PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.  The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and
     Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee
     and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.

                              ROBY
               There could be a whole city out
               there and we'd never see it.

                              BROUSSARD
               Not sitting on our butts in here,
               that's for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any
               response yet?

                              MELKONIS
                    (pulls off his earphones)
               Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn
               transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've
               tried every frequency on the
               spectrum.

                              BROUSSARD
               Are we just going to sit around and
               wait for an invitation?

     Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console
     and speaks into the mike.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hello, Faust!

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Yeah!

                              ROBY
               How's it coming on the engines?

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking
     into a wall intercom.

                              FAUST
               I never saw anything as fine as this
               dust... these cells are all pitted on
               a microscopic level.  I have to
               polish these things smooth again, so
               it's going to take a while.  Okay?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.
                    (puts down the mike)

                              STANDARD
               Sandy... how far are we from the
               source of the transmission?

                              MELKONIS
               Source of transmission is to the
               northeast... about 300 meters.

                              ROBY
               Close... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Close enough to walk to!

                              STANDARD
               Martin, would you run me an
               atmospheric?

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons and
                     consults his panels)
               10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... 
               and some trace elements.

                              STANDARD
               Nontoxic... but unbreathable.
               Pressure?

                              ROBY
               Ten to the fourth dynes per square
               centimeter.

                              STANDARD
               Good!  Moisture content?

                              ROBY
               Zero.  Dry as a bone.

                              STANDARD
               Any microorganisms?

                              ROBY
               Not a one.  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Anything else?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we won't need pressure suits,
               but breathing masks are called for.
               Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of
               portable unit that we can use to
               follow that transmission to its
               source?

                              MELKONIS
               No problem.

                              BROUSSARD
               I volunteer for the exploration
               party.

                              STANDARD
               I heard you.  You want to break out
               the side arms?

     INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves,
     boots, jackets, and pistols.

     Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut,
     sealing them into the lock.

     They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks.

                              STANDARD
                    (adjusting the radio on his
                     mask)
               I'm sending.  Do you hear me?

                              BROUSSARD
               Receiving.

                              MELKONIS
               Receiving.

                              STANDARD
               All right.  Now just remember: keep
               away from those weapons unless I say
               otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Read you, Chaz.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Open the outer door.

     Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams
     into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE
     WIND OUTSIDE.

     A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it
     hits the ground.

     Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet.
     Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock.

     The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at
     their clothes.  Nothing can be seen.

                              STANDARD
               Which way, Sandy?

     Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.

                              MELKONIS
                    (pointing)
               That way.

                              STANDARD
               You lead.

     Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the
     others.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Martin.  We're on our way.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his
     console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a
     screen.

                              ROBY
               Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you
               on my board.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Good.  I'm getting you clear too.
               Let's just keep the line open.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and
     shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements,
     they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean.

     Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction
     finder.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Can't see more than three meters in
               any direction out here.  We're
               walking blind, on instruments.

     They wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               What's wrong?

                              MELKONIS
               My signal's fading.

     He studies the direction finder.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               It's the dust, it's interfering... 

     His concentration is so great that he does NOT NOTICE HUNTER COMING UP
     BEHIND HIM.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... Hold it, I've got it again.  It's
               over that way.

     Standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ROBY, Hunter speaks.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening?

     Startled out of his wits, Roby GASPS and whirls around to face Hunter.

                              ROBY
                    (startled silly)
               Hell!

     Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves into
     embarrassed anger.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men push their way through the storm.  Melkonis stops again,
     studies the direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               It's close, real close.

                              STANDARD
               How far?

                              MELKONIS
               We should be almost on top of it.  I
               just can't quite... 

     Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points.  The others stare
     in the direction he is pointing.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POINT-OF-VIEW

     Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out
     some kind of HUGE SHAPE.

     As we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHIP
     RISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL.  It is clearly of
     non-human manufacture.

     ANGLE ON THE MEN

     They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft.  Finally, Standard
     finds his voice.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, uh, we've found it.

                              ROBY
                    (sharply -- over, filtered)
               Found what?

                              STANDARD
               It appears to be some sort of
               spacecraft.  We're going to approach
               it.

     They start toward the alien ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               There are no signs of life.  No
               lights... no movement... 

     Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               We're, uh, approaching the base.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF TOADSTOOL SHIP - DAY

     A strangely shaped DOOR yawns open at the base of the ship.  Dust and
     sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.

     With great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Appears to be a door hanging open,
               the entrance is clogged with debris.

                              BROUSSARD
               Looks like a derelict.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to
               hold the conversation to a minimum
               from here on.

     INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY

     The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness,
     spewing dust.  In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless
     shapes.

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the
     doorway.  They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS",
     and step in.

   

   

     Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct
     machinery.

                              MELKONIS
               Air lock?

                              STANDARD
               Who knows?

                              BROUSSARD
               Let's try and find the control room.

     As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls,
     ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.

                              MELKONIS
               Look at these holes.  This place
               looks like Swiss cheese.

     Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.

                              BROUSSARD
               This hole goes up several decks --
               looks like somebody was firing a
               military disintegrator in here.

     They all peer up the hole into darkness.

                              STANDARD
               Climbing gear.

     Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it.
     He aims it up into the hole and fires.

     The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There
     is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll go first.

                              STANDARD
               No, you'll follow me.

     Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and
     presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the
     hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.

     Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP

     This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the
     hole.

     Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a
     beam through the hanging dust.

     Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own
     light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.

     THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns
     of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes.

     Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it.

     It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings.
     Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is
     empty.

     Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have
     illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,
     SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.

     They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A
     GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.

                              MELKONIS
               Holy Christ... 

     Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton
     is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.

                              STANDARD
               Look at this... 

     They approach.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Something has been scratched here... 
               into the veneer.  See?

     Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a
     sharp instrument, is a small triangle:

   

   

     Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the
     beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.

     Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.

                              MELKONIS
               LOOK OUT, IT MOVED!

     Standard knocks his hand down.

                              STANDARD
               Keep away from that gun!

     Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he
     begins to move toward the far side of the room.

     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.
     There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back
     and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Just machinery.

                              BROUSSARD
               But functioning.

     Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               That's where the transmission is
               coming from.

     He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a
     hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.

                              BROUSSARD
               A recording.  A damned automatic
               recording.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET

     SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color
     of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its
     wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly
     combatting the darkness and the storm.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching
     holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken
     by their "datasticks" (flashlight/cameras).

     Standard is commenting on the changing slides.

                              STANDARD
               ... This is the control room... 

     Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the
     suited men standing against banks of machinery.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... Some details of the control
               room... 

     The SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is the skeleton... another
               view of the skeleton... the
               transmitting device... 

     The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is a closeup of the triangle
               we found scrawled on the console in
               front of the skeleton... 

     Standard changes the slide.  The screen goes white.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... And that's it.

     He turns off the projector and brings the lights up.

                              HUNTER
               Phenomenal.  Staggering.

                              BROUSSARD
               We've got to go back and take a lot
               more pictures, holograph
               everything.

                              MELKONIS
               And bring back as much physical
               evidence as possible, too.  The rest
               of the skeleton.  Some of the
               machinery.  Written records, if there
               are any.

     Roby is slumped in his chair.  He has said nothing.

                              STANDARD
               Martin?

                              ROBY
               I agree.  This is the single most
               important discovery in history.

                              STANDARD
               But?

                              ROBY
               What killed it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, that thing's been dead for
               years.  Maybe hundreds of years.  The
               whole planet's dead.

                              FAUST
               The way I figure it, they landed
               here for repairs or something, then
               they couldn't take off again.  Maybe
               the dust ruined their engines.  They
               set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody
               came.  So they died.

                              ROBY
               He died.

                              FAUST
               What?

                              ROBY
               Not they... he... 

     They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod.  CAMERA MOVES
     OVER TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SKULL SITTING ON A TABLE.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               ... There was only one skeleton.

     There is a moment of silence.

                              STANDARD
               Jay... how's it coming on the
               repairs?

                              FAUST
               Well... I'm going to have to blow the
               engines out... 

                              STANDARD
               And when will you be ready to do
               that?

                              FAUST
               Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

                              STANDARD
               Then why the hell are you sitting
               around here?

                              FAUST
               Right.

     The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in
     thought, staring at the skull.  Melkonis lingers in the room with him.

                              MELKONIS
               And there sits man's first contact
               with intelligent life in the
               universe.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON THE SHIP, its spotlights cutting into the gloom.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     A room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of
     releasing unimaginable energies.

     Faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the
     engines, with spotlights on it.  He is wearing goggles and thin gloves.

                              FAUST
               You ready up there?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Broussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with
     Faust while they watch their instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure, we're ready.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

                              FAUST
               Okay.  I'm going to start the
               extraction procedure now.

     He pauses to wipe his brow.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the
     photographic slides on the screen.  He is clicking slowly through them.
     He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it.

     The alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him.  He
     picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it.

     Standard appears in the doorway.

                              STANDARD
               Alas, poor Yorick.

     Roby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (nodding at the screen)
               Find anything we missed?

                              ROBY
                    (shrugs)
               I don't even know what I'm looking
               for.

                              STANDARD
               Still worried?

                              ROBY
               Oh well... you know me.

                              STANDARD
               I've always respected your opinion,
               Martin.  If something worries you, it
               worries me.

     Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY
     DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL.

                              ROBY
               What would you say that was supposed
               to mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well... it's obviously intentional... 
               some kind of attempt at
               communication... maybe it's a symbol
               that means something to them... 

                              ROBY
               But why draw it on the wall?

     Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.

     He rises and goes to the coffee machine.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (picking a hair out of
                     the coffeepot)
               This ship is full of cat hair.

                              STANDARD
               Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as
               the engine's fixed --

     BEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and
     presses the button.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               This is Chaz.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come
               topside for a minute?

                              STANDARD
               What's up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Well, the sun just came up again,
               and it seems the wind's died down.
               It's as clear as a bell outside.
               There's something I think you ought
               to see.

                              STANDARD
               I'm on my way.

     He and Roby head for the door.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.

                              STANDARD
               What is it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Take a look.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               I was scanning the horizon to see
               what I could pick up.  Look there, on
               that screen.

                              STANDARD
               What is it, I can't --

     BLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image.

     The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon.

     They all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the
     PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien
     ship.

   

   

     Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz.  All hands topside.
               Now.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     ANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA
     PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the
     room.

                              STANDARD
               Doesn't seem much doubt about it,
               does there?

                              MELKONIS
               That creature sure must have
               considered it important... using his
               last strength to draw it... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe they built it.

                              FAUST
               As what?

                              BROUSSARD
               A marker for buried instrumentation?

                              HUNTER
               Or a mass grave.

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe the rest of the crew is in
               there -- in some kind of suspended
               animation, waiting to be rescued.

                              MELKONIS
               It wasn't necessarily built by them.

     On the screens, a puff of DUST blows in front of the pyramid.

                              ROBY
               Here comes the dust again.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     WITH A SHRIEK, THE DUST STORM RETURNS, completely obscuring the SNARK.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Well, does anyone else agree with
               Martin that we should not explore
               it?

     Everyone looks around the room, but no one volunteers.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Then the sooner we get moving, the
               better.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     LONG SHOT OF THE STONE PYRAMID, dust blowing in front of it.  It is a
     crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless,
     tapering toward the top.

     Standard, Broussard, and Melkonis, wearing the protective suits,
     approach the pyramid.  As they draw near, it becomes clear that the
     pyramid is roughly 50 feet tall.

                              STANDARD
               We can't make out any details or
               features yet... but it's definitely
               too regular for a natural
               formation... 

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby and Hunter are present.  They are listening to Standard's VOICE ON
     THE RADIO.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... There's one thing I can say for
               sure though... 

     BUZZZZZ!  Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.

                              ROBY
               Now what's wrong?

                              HUNTER
               I've completely lost their signal.

                              ROBY
               Can you get them back?

                              HUNTER
               I'm trying.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The three men come to the base of the massive structure.  Dust and sand
     have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the
     base.

                              MELKONIS
               This looks ancient.

                              STANDARD
               Can't tell -- these weather
               conditions could erode anything,
               fast.

     They walk around the base.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's no entrance.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe the entrance is buried.  Could
               be under our feet.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe there is no entrance; the
               thing may be solid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Well, there ought to be some way we
               can get through to them --

     The INTERCOM BEEPS.  Faust's voice is heard.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna
               charge up the engines for a minute,
               okay?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.

     A LOUD, POWERFUL THROBBING BEGINS, drowning out all other sounds, as
     the engines are tested.

     A light on Roby's panel is FLASHING.  We can see that it is the
     COMPUTER ALERT.

     Irritably, Roby throws the switch.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Yes!

                              COMPUTER
               I have a temporary sequence on the
               monitor --

                              ROBY
               Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!

     He puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computer's voice over.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Go ahead!

     There is a PAUSE while Roby listens to the computer.  His eyes widen.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               You mean... you've translated it?

     Another PAUSE as he listens to the earphone.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Well come on, come on!  What does it
               say?

     Another PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His
     mouth works.

     Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE.

                              HUNTER
                    (looking over at Roby)
               What?  What was that?

                              ROBY
               The computer just translated the
               goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S.
               It was a warning.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe we can get in by the top.

                              STANDARD
               You want to try?

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure.

     Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the
     top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               You guys just wait down here till I
               say it's okay to come up.

     Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side
     of the pyramid.

     OMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust
     blowing, the wind shrieking.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at
     the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's a hole at the top.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Can we come up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               No, it's too small, only room enough
               for one person.

                              STANDARD
               Can you see anything in the hole?

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness.

     Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on
     the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole.

                              BROUSSARD
               I can see... partway down.  It just
               goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth
               walls.  I can't see the bottom --
               light won't reach.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face.

                              FAUST
               Yes?  What is it?

                              ROBY
               Jay, we've got a problem.  I was
               wondering if there was any way you
               could shortcut the repairs and give
               us immediate takeoff capability.

                              FAUST
                    (quickly)
               Why, what's wrong?

                              ROBY
               The computer's translated the alien
               signal, and it's kind of alarming.

                              FAUST
               What do you mean?

                              ROBY
               It couldn't translate the whole
               thing, only three phrases.  I'll just
               read it to you the way I got it:
                    (reads from a strip of paper)
               "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO
               NOT LAND... "
                    (looks up at the others)
               And that's all it could translate.

     Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from
     his belt.

               Dell, you want to come down, we can
               figure out where to go from here.

                              BROUSSARD
               No, I want to go in.

     Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Dell, but just for a
               preliminary look-around.  Don't
               unhook yourself from your cable.  And
               be out in less than ten minutes.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

     Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He
     unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end
     of it to his chest unit.

     He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by
     the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Okay, I'm in the mouth of the
               chimney now, and I'm starting down.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Take care.

     Broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the
     hole.

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel,
     Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the
     depths.

     The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's noticeably warmer in here.  Warm
               air rising from below.

     He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops,
     pushing off each time with his feet.

     He stops to catch his breath.  His breathing rasps loudly in his
     helmet.

     A little sunlight filters down from above.  Looking up, he can see the
     mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light.

     Standard's voice comes over his earphones.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Are you okay in there?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (gasping for breath)
               Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom
               yet.  Definitely a column of warm air
               rising; it keeps the shaft clear of
               dust.

                              STANDARD

               What was that Dell, I lost you, do
               you read me?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't
               talk now.

     He kicks off and continues down, taking longer and longer hops as he
     gains confidence.

     Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               I'm way below ground level.

                              MELKONIS
               I couldn't make it out -- too much
               interference.

     Roby and Hunter.

                              HUNTER
               I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area
               around the pyramid is dead to
               transmission.  I think we should go
               after them.

                              ROBY
               No.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean, no?

                              ROBY
               We're not going anywhere.

                              HUNTER
               But they don't know about the
               translation!  They could be in danger
               right now.

                              ROBY
               We can't spare the personnel.  We've
               got minimum takeoff capability right
               now.  That's why Chaz left us on
               board.

                              HUNTER
               Why, you chickenshit bastard --

                              ROBY
               Just can that crap!  I'm in command
               here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's
               leaving this ship!

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard resumes his downward climb.  SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR
     PURCHASE AS THE WALLS OF THE SHAFT DISAPPEAR.

     The tunnel has reached its end.  Below him is an unfathomable,
     cavernous space.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (huffing and puffing)
               Tunnel's gone -- cave or something
               below me -- feels like the tropics
               in here; air is warm and humid... 
                    (consults his instruments)
               ... high oxygen content, no dust,
               it's completely breathable --

     Puffing with exertion, he releases his purchase on the stone walls and
     begins to lower himself on power.  Now he is dangling free in darkness,
     spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds.

     Finally, his feet hit bottom.  He grunts in surprise and almost loses
     his balance.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - DAY

     Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of
     sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above.  Around is
     solid darkness.

     He flashes his datastick around.  The beam reveals that he is in a
     stone room.  STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls.  They have
     a primitive, religious appearance.  Row after row of pictograms stretch
     from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language.  Huge
     religious symbols dominate one wall.

     Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque
     monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's unbelievable!  It's like some
               kind of tomb... some primitive
               religion!  Hey, is anybody there?  Do
               you read me?  Standard!

     Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them
     hanging around his neck.  He takes a deep breath of the wet air.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - LATE AFTERNOON

     Standard and Melkonis are standing around nervously.

                              STANDARD
               If we don't hear from him soon, I
               think we better go in after him.

                              MELKONIS
               Sun will be down in a minute.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON

     Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is
     dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF
     LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS
     IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED.

     He walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He
     shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.

     He lifts his mask radio to his lips.

                              BROUSSARD
               I don't know if you can hear me, but
               the place is full of large bottles
               or jars, just like the one we found
               on the other ship -- except these
               are all sealed.  Also they're soft to
               the touch.

     He peers more closely at the leathery object.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Another funny thing -- I just put my
               hand on it, and now there are these
               raised areas appearing where my
               fingertips were.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     THE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom.
     Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights.

                              STANDARD
               Let's go.

     He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT

     Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the
     wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters.

     He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he
     turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN
     THE TOP OF IT.

     He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn."  There lies
     the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and
     studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside
     surface is spongy and irregular.

     Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn."

     He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITH
     SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES
     ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.

     With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the
     thing with his hands.

   

   

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT

     The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top,
     lights bobbing in the darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (puffing with exertion)
               Here's his line.  We can haul him out
               of there if we have to.

                              MELKONIS
               It'll yank him right off his feet if
               he's not expecting it.  The line
               could get tangled in something.

                              STANDARD
               But what can we do?  He's out of
               radio contact.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we should just wait a few more
               minutes.

     Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.

                              STANDARD
                    (making up his mind)
               No, I told him to be out in ten
               minutes.  It's been much longer.
               Let's get him out of there.

     Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the
     tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which
     Broussard's line dangles.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               The line's slack.  Christ, do you
               think the idiot unhooked himself?

     He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the
     line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the
     motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               There, it caught!

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still coming up, or is it
               hooked on something?

                              STANDARD
               No, it's coming.

                              MELKONIS
               Can you see anything?

     Standard shines his light down into the hole.

                              STANDARD
               No, I can't see far enough.  The
               line's moving, though.

     For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid,
     saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls.
     Then Standard shines his light back down in.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I can see him!  Here he comes!

     The winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Get ready to grab him!

     Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the
     wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Look out!  There's something on
               his face!

     Melkonis attempts to come to his aid.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               Don't touch him, watch it!

     In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally
     regain their balance.  They shine their lights on Broussard.

     He appears to be completely unconscious -- AND THE OCTOPUS THING IS
     STILL WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACE, MOTIONLESS.

                              MELKONIS
               Oh God, oh God no.

                              STANDARD
               Help me -- I'm going to try to get
               it off.

     With his gloved hands, Standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to
     pull it from Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It won't come -- it's stuck.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               How the hell should I know?  Come on,
               give me a hand, let's get him out of
               there!

     The two men grapple with Broussard's limp body, lifting him from the
     hole.

     Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.  There is a long moment
     while nothing is said, then:

               We'll need some help getting him
               into the ship.

     Roby collapses into a chair, suddenly limp with apprehension.  He's
     feared something like this all along, and now it has begun to happen.

                              ROBY
                    (to himself)

                              FAUST
               Hurt!  How?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- maybe we'll be real
               lucky and he just broke his neck.
                    (a beat)
               I knew we shouldn't of come down
               here.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Roby is seated alone in the room, listening to the transmission from
     Standard and Melkonis.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, are you there?

     Roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone.

                              ROBY
               Here, Chaz.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We're coming up now, open the outer
               lock door.

                              ROBY
               Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               It's some kind of organism, it's
               attached itself to him.  Let us in.

     Roby does not reply.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer
               door.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, if it's an organism, and we
               let it in, the ship will be
               infected.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We can't leave him out here, open
               the door.

                              ROBY
                    (urgently)
               Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken
               every rule of quarantine.  If we
               bring an organism on board, we won't
               have a single layer of defense left.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is an order!  Open the
               door!

     Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     A RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large
     servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK.

                              HUNTER
               Outer door's open.

     After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another
     CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off.

     The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through,
     carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust
     follows them out of the lock.

                              STANDARD
                    (pulling off his mask)
               You men stay clear, there's a
               parasite on him.

     Hunter and Faust RECOIL.

                              HUNTER
               Oh -- God -- oh --

                              FAUST
               Is it alive?

                              STANDARD
               I don't know but don't touch it.
               Give us a hand here, let's get him
               up to the Autodoc.

     Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the
     medical room, carrying Broussard.

     Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with
     machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed,
     which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.

                              STANDARD
               Help me, come on, let's get him up
               here.

     They slide the man onto the bunk.

                              HUNTER
               That thing, God almighty, didn't you
               try to get it off him?

                              STANDARD
               It wouldn't come.

     Standard yanks off his gloves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Medical gloves.

     They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull
     them on.

     Gingerly, they approach Broussard.

     Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing
     on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to
     pull it free.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It's really on there tight.

                              FAUST
               Here, let me try.

     Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip
     of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his
     weight.

                              STANDARD
                    (grabbing Faust's hands)
               Stop it, you're tearing his face.

     A trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek.

                              MELKONIS
               It's not coming off -- not without
               his whole face coming off too.

                              STANDARD
               Let's let the machine work on him.

     Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a
     couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard
     is sucked into the slot in the wall.

     He is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of
     disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.

     A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different
     parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.

     ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.

     Standard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard
     each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE
     FACE.

     The others are shocked.

                              HUNTER
               Hey now, what is this?

                              STANDARD
               Ask him.

                              ROBY
                    (slowly puts his hand
                     to his cheek)
               I understand why you did that.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

                              MELKONIS
               He wouldn't open the lock; he was
               going to leave us out there.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I
               mean, you brought the goddamn thing
               in here.  Maybe you deserve to get
               slapped.

                              FAUST
                    (embarrassed)
               Excuse me, I've got work to do.

     Faust exits.

                              HUNTER
               I keep my mouth pretty much shut,
               but I don't like hitting.

                              ROBY
                    (to Standard)
               I guess I had it coming.  Let's call
               it settled.

     After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns
     his attention to the machinery.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (slowly)
               Would somebody fill me in?

                              STANDARD
               He went into the pyramid alone.  We
               lost radio contact with him.  When we
               pulled him out, it was on his face.
               It won't come off, not without
               injuring him.

                              HUNTER
               Where did it come from?

                              MELKONIS
               He's the only one that knows that.

                              HUNTER
               How does he breathe?

     They study the monitors.

                              MELKONIS
               Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth
               are blocked.

                              STANDARD
               Let's look inside his head.

     Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray
     image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER
     TORSO.

     The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the
     creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is
     that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open,
     and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED
     INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.

                              ROBY
               Look at that.

                              HUNTER
               What is it -- I can't tell
               anything --

                              ROBY
               It's some kind of organ -- it's
               inserted some kind of tube or
               something down his throat.

                              HUNTER
                    (turning sick)
               Oh... God... 

     Hunter bends over and RETCHES.

                              ROBY
               I think that's how it's getting
               oxygen to him.

                              HUNTER
               It doesn't make any sense.  It
               paralyzes him... puts him into a
               coma... then keeps him alive.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't expect to understand a life
               form like this.  We're out of our
               back yard.  Things are different
               here.

                              HUNTER
               Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we
               can't leave the damn thing on him.

                              MELKONIS
               We don't know what might happen if
               we tried to kill it.  At least right
               now it's keeping him alive.

                              HUNTER
               How about cutting it off?  We can't
               pull it loose, but we can cut off
               everything but the bottom layer,
               where it's stuck to his face.

                              STANDARD
               You're right... we can't stand here
               and do nothing.

     Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head.
     Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch
     and Broussard slides back out of the booth.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled in his mask)
               Somebody give me a scalpel.

     Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall,
     and carefully passes it to Standard.

     Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his
     hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button
     with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum.

     Standard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously.
     Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and
     holds it inconspicuously at his side.

     Standard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to
     the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the
     back of Broussard's head.

     Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue.
     Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               I've made an incision... it's not
               reacting... but some kind of
               yellowish fluid is leaking out of
               the wound... 

     The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to
     Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of
     smoke curls up from the stain.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               Hold it, this stuff's smoking!

     The others REACT nervously.

     By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has
     dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble
     and sizzle, and more smoke rises.

     The men start to COUGH.

                              MELKONIS
               God, that smoke's poisonous!

                              HUNTER
                    (pointing)
               It's eating a hole in the floor!

     Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the
     corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.

     Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a
     bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and
     in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They
     begin to smoke.

     Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves.
     Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

                              STANDARD
               That stuff's eating right through
               the metal!  It's going to eat through
               the decks and right out through the
               hull!

     By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to
     the level below.

                              STANDARD
               There!  Look!

     A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and
     drips to the floor.

     It bubbles on the floor.

                              MELKONIS
               Jesus, what can we put under it?

     Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below.

     INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW

     Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at
     the ceiling.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               There.  Should be coming through
               about there.

                              HUNTER
               Careful, don't get under it!

     INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE

     Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid
     sizzles.

                              MELKONIS
               Christ, that stinks.

     Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the
     floor.

                              ROBY
               Seems to have stopped penetrating.

     Hunter comes charging up the steps.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening up here?

                              ROBY
               I think it's fizzled out.

     Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the
     pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by
     the end.

                              MELKONIS
               I never saw anything like that in my
               life... except molecular acid.

                              HUNTER
               But this thing uses it for blood.

                              MELKONIS
               Hell of a defense mechanism.  You
               don't dare kill it.

     Standard comes up the stairs.

                              STANDARD
               It's stopped?

                              MELKONIS
               Yes, thank heaven.

                              STANDARD
               We're just plain lucky.  That could
               have gone right through the hull --
               taken weeks to patch it.

                              MELKONIS
               Reminded me of when I was a kid and
               the roof leaked -- everybody running
               for the pots and pans.

                              ROBY
               My God, what about Broussard?

     They turn and run up the stairs.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen).
     Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.

                              ROBY
               Did it get on him?

     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD
               No, thank God... just missed him.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still dripping?

                              STANDARD
                    (examining it)
               It appears to have healed itself.

                              HUNTER
               It makes me sick to see him like
               that.

                              MELKONIS
               Isn't there some way we can get it
               off him?

                              STANDARD
               I don't see how.  But let's do what
               we can for him.

     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the
     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up
     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think we'd better get some
               intravenous feeding started.  God
               knows what that thing is leaching
               out of him.

     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade
     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.

                              ROBY
                    (studying the screens)
               Look there, what's that stain on his
               lungs?

     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's
     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.

                              MELKONIS
               It appears to be a heavy fluid of
               some sort... it blocks the X-rays... 

                              ROBY
               That tube must be depositing it in
               him.

                              MELKONIS
               Could be some kind of venom, or
               poison... 

                              HUNTER
               This is horrible.

                              ROBY
               Hey!  what about the film?

                              STANDARD
               What film?

                              ROBY
               Broussard had film in his datastick,
               didn't he?  We can see what happened
               to him.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Again we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,
     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs
     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.

     The camera reveals the "urns."  The climax of the sequence of stills
     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA --
     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to
     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.

                              HUNTER
               That must have been when he got it.

                              ROBY
               The same thing must've happened to
               the creatures on the other ship... 
               except they took one of those jars
               on board, and opened it there.

                              MELKONIS
                    (clicks back through the
                     slides to a picture of
                     one of the "urns")
               At first I thought they were jars
               too, or artifacts anyway.  But
               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore
               casings.  Let's go back to the
               heiroglyphics.

     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a
     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of
     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.

                              STANDARD
               I personally can't make any sense
               out of it... 

     CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing
     different angles on the glyphs.

                              MELKONIS
               It's a crude symbolic language --
               looks primitive.

                              HUNTER
               You can't tell -- that kind of stuff
               could represent printed circuits... 

                              STANDARD
               That sounds a little fanciful... 

                              MELKONIS
               Primitive pictorial languages are
               based on common objects in the
               environment, and this can be used as
               a starting point for translation... 

                              ROBY
               What common objects?

                              HUNTER
               Listen, hadn't somebody better check
               on Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (rising)
               I'll do it.  The rest of you
               continue.

                              HUNTER
                    (rising)
               I'll come with you.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

     Standard and Hunter come down the passageway.

                              STANDARD
               You know, it's fantastic -- the
               human race has gone this long
               without ever encountering another
               advanced life form, and now we run
               into a veritable zoo.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well, those things out there aren't
               the same, you know -- the spaceship
               and the pyramid.  They're from
               different cultures and different
               races.  That ship just landed here --
               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and
               the thing from it are indigenous.

                              HUNTER
               How could anything be indigenous to
               this asteroid?  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe it wasn't always dead.

     They arrive at the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     The door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates
     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.

     THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.

                              HUNTER
               It's gone.

     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS
     FACE.

     Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE IS
     COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.

                              HUNTER
               Now we're in for it.

                              STANDARD
               The door was closed.  It must still
               be in here.

     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the
     door.  Standard grabs his arm.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               No, don't open the door.  We don't
               want it escaping.

                              HUNTER
                    (very nervous)
               Well, what the hell good can we do
               in here?  We can't grab it -- it
               might jump on us --

                              STANDARD
               Maybe we can catch it.

     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               As long as we're careful not to
               damage it... 

     Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly
     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.

     He bends down and peers under the bunk.

     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE
     THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.

     He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO
     THE FLOOR.

                              STANDARD
                    (leaping back)
               Shit!

     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its
     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.

     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and
     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not
     respond.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think it's dead.

     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite
     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.

     INTERIOR - LABORATORY

     Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a
     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.

     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.

                              STANDARD
               Look at these suckers -- no wonder
               we couldn't get it off him.

                              ROBY
               Is that its mouth?

                              MELKONIS
               More likely that organ -- the tube-
               like thing -- fits up in there.

     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy
     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.

                              ROBY
               Ugh.

     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.

                              STANDARD
               Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme
               something to grab it with!

     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.

     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at
     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes
     the thing in the tongs.

     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Christ!  Let's get it out of here!

     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing
     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the
     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is
     already on the intercom:

                              ROBY
                    (shouts into intercom)
               For Chrissake, open the main lock!

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the
     thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed
     by the inevitable dust.

     Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY

     The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust,
     smouldering and fuming.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     The outer door rolls shut.

                              ROBY
                    (slumping against the
                     wall)
               My God, it's lethal even when it's
               dead!

     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in
     the floor.

     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,
     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              HUNTER
                    (over intercom,
                     filtered)
               Yes?

                              STANDARD
               How's Broussard?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               He's running a fever.

                              STANDARD
               Still unconscious?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               Yes.

                              STANDARD
               Can you do anything for him?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               The machine will bring his
               temperature down.  His vital
               functions are strong.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

     He switches off the intercom.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (suddenly exhausted)
               I need some coffee.

     He turns and walks away.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats;
     Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.

                              MELKONIS
               These day and night cycles are
               totally disorienting.  I feel like
               we've been here for days, but it's
               only been how long?

                              ROBY
                    (stroking the cat)
               About four hours.

                              STANDARD
                    (staring into his coffee
                     cup)
               I'm sorry to say it looks like you
               were right in the first place,
               Martin.  We never should have landed
               here.

                              ROBY
               Look, I'm not trying to rub
               anybody's nose in anything.  The
               important thing is just to get away
               from here as fast as possible.

                              STANDARD
               I can't lean on Faust any harder --
               he's been working non-stop on the
               engines.

                              ROBY
               If we knew exactly what happened to
               the beings on the other ship --

                              MELKONIS
               We do know that.

                              ROBY
               Yeah?

                              MELKONIS
               They never made it off the planet.
               The parasites won.

     This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.

                              ROBY
               Where did the parasites come from?

                              STANDARD
               They seem native to the planet.  It's
               got an atmosphere and a dense
               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it
               must have been fertile.

                              MELKONIS
               No.  It's just too small to support
               fauna as big as the parasites.  If
               there were a native ecology, it
               would have to be microscopic.

                              ROBY
               Couldn't the pyramid have been built
               here by space travellers?

                              STANDARD
               Too primitive.  It's a pre-
               technological construction.  That
               slab was engineered by an Iron-Age
               culture at best.

                              MELKONIS
               They're from a dead civilization;
               they're spores from a tomb.  God
               knows how long they've been here.

                              ROBY
               I think we better take another look
               at those heiroglyphs.

     Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in.  He is covered
     with dirt and grime.

                              FAUST
               Hey, guess what?

                              STANDARD
               What?

                              FAUST
               The engines are fixed.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OUT
     STREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust.

     The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited
     power.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     They are all at their posts.

                              STANDARD
               Switch on tractor beams.

     There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whole
     ship, and it begins to float, like a cork in water.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Lock tractor beams.

     The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Retract landing struts.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force.
     The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Take us up.

                              ROBY
                    (into intercom)
               Up one kilometer, Jay.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Switch on lifter quads.

     A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - DAY

     The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking
     atmosphere.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Engage artificial gravity.

     Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.

                              ROBY
               Engaged.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take her into an escape orbit.

     The men get busy with switches.

                              ROBY
               I'm altering our vector now; should
               give us an easy escape velocity --

     A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              ROBY & MELKONIS
                    (in concert)
               What was that?

     In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               This dust is getting clogged in the
               intakes again!

                              STANDARD
               Just hold us together till we're in
               space, that's all!

     The pitch of the engines changes, deepens.

     EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY

     The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds.
     Visibility is zero.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning
     to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to
     suck up some of the dust.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS
     THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim,
     set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically
     they mutter technical instructions to each other.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT
     INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They all CHEER.

                              ROBY
                    (pounds his panel)
               We made it!  Damn, we made it!

                              STANDARD
               You bet we made it.  Martin, set
               course for Irth and accelerate us
               into stardrive.

                              ROBY
               With great pleasure.

     Roby begins to punch buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I feel like an escapee from Hell.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER

     The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the
     universe all around.

     There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching
     the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red.  This is
     redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They are unstrapping.

                              ROBY
               That's the part that always makes me
               feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we
               accelerate into light speed.

                              STANDARD
               Quit complaining; we're in space.

     They rise and head out of the room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     As they walk along.

                              STANDARD
               I think the best thing to do with
               Broussard is to just freeze him as
               he is.  It'll arrest the progress of
               his disease, and he can get complete
               medical attention when we get back
               to the Colonies.

                              ROBY
               We'll have to go into quarantine,
               maybe for quite a while.

                              STANDARD
               That's okay, he can remain in
               hypersleep until they're ready to
               treat him.

     They enter the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP
     in BED -- AWAKE.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (hoarsely)
               ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some
               water... 

     Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it
     down in a swallow.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               More.

     Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard,
     who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the
     bunk.

                              STANDARD
                    (softly)
               How do you feel, Dell?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (weakly)
               Wretched.  What happened to me?

                              STANDARD
               Don't you remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly
               remember my name.

                              ROBY
               Are you in pain?

                              BROUSSARD
               Not exactly, just feel like
               somebody's been beating me with
               rubber hoses for about six years.

     Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him.

                              STANDARD
               Hell, you're in great shape, you've
               got your sense of humor back!

                              BROUSSARD
               God I'm hungry.

                              ROBY
               Dell, what's the last thing you can
               remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               ... I don't know... 

                              ROBY
               Do you remember the pyramid?

                              BROUSSARD
               No.  Just some horrible dreams about
               smothering.  Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               We're going home.  We're in
               hyperspace.

                              MELKONIS
               We're going into the freezers now.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm really starving; can we get some
               food before we go into the freezers?

                              STANDARD
                    (laughs)
               I think that's a pretty reasonable
               request.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions
     greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table.

                              HUNTER
               Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a
               straight shot back to the Colonies,
               and then we can start taking bids on
               the paydirt.  Any bets on the top
               bid?

                              FAUST
                    (chewing)
               Well, we should at least be able to
               each buy our own planet.

     They all CHUCKLE.

                              MELKONIS
               I'm going to write a book about this
               expedition.  I'm going to call it
               "The Snark Log."

                              STANDARD
                    (stiffly)
               The commander normally has first
               publication rights.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we could write it together.

                              ROBY
               First thing I'm going to do when we
               get back is eat some biological
               food.

                              MELKONIS
               What's the matter, you don't like
               this stuff?

                              ROBY
               Tastes like something you'd feed a
               chicken to make it lay more eggs.

                              STANDARD
               Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag
               than this, but I've had worse too,
               if you know what I mean.

                              FAUST
               I kind of like it.

                              ROBY
               You like this shit?

                              FAUST
               It grows on you.

                              ROBY
               You know what they make this stuff
               out of?

                              FAUST
                    (annoyed)
               Yes, I know what they make it out
               of, so what?  It's food now.  You're
               eating it.

                              ROBY
               I didn't say it was bad for you,
               it's just kind of sickening, that's
               all.

                              HUNTER
               Do we have to talk about this kind
               of crap at the dinner table?

     Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.

                              STANDARD
               What's wrong?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (his voice straining)
               I don't know... I'm getting these
               CRAMPS!

     The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles
     whitening.

                              STANDARD
               Breathe deeply.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (screaming)
               OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!

                              ROBY
               What Dell -- what?

     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is
     trembling violently from head to foot.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (incoherent shriek)
               OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!

     A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.

     THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS
     TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A
     MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.

     Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and
     bolts.

     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's
     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood
     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and
     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.

     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,
     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with
     blood and slime.

                              HUNTER
               Oh, no.  Oh, no.

                              FAUST
               What was that?  What the Christ was
               that?

                              MELKONIS
               It was growing in him the whole time
               and he didn't even know it!

     Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.

                              ROBY
               That thing used him for an
               incubator!

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped
     body tumbles silently out.

     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into
     eternity.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't go into hypersleep with
               that thing running around loose.

                              HUNTER
               We'd be sitting ducks in the
               freezers.

                              ROBY
               But we can't kill it.  If we kill it,
               it will spill all its body acids
               right through our hull and out into
               space.

                              FAUST
               Shit... 

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to catch it and eject it
               from the ship.

                              MELKONIS
                    (sighs)
               Well, I kind of hate to point it
               out, but all our supplies are based
               on us spending a strictly limited
               amount of time out of suspended
               animation... and as you know, we used
               up most of that time in harvesting.

                              STANDARD
               We've got about a week left, right?

                              HUNTER
               And then we run out of food and
               oxygen.

                              FAUST
               The water will still recycle.

                              ROBY
               We won't need it then.

                              STANDARD
               All right, so that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's plenty of time.

                              ROBY
               But if we haven't caught it in a
               week, then we have to go into the
               freezers anyway.

     They enter the bridge.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               So does anybody have any
               suggestions?

                              FAUST
               We could put on our pressure suits
               and blow all the air out of the
               ship.  That would kill it.

                              STANDARD
               No, we can't afford to lose that
               much oxygen.  We're going to have to
               flush it out.

                              MELKONIS
               How?

                              STANDARD
               Room by room, corridor by corridor.

     No one likes this thought.

                              MELKONIS
               And what do we do when we find it?

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we
               had a really strong piece of net, we
               could bag it.

                              FAUST
               We could cut a section out of that
               metallite netting.  It won't hold up
               to that acid, but aside from that
               it's pretty strong.

                              ROBY
               We have to avoid injuring it.  What
               we really need is some electric
               animal prods.

                              HUNTER
               I think I could cobble something
               together.  A long metal rod with a
               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a
               shock.

                              STANDARD
               Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm
               issuing a standing order: from this
               moment forth, every one of us will
               wear protective garments, including
               helmets.  Let's get down to the
               locker and change.

     They start for the exit.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is
     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot
     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.

     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different
     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical
     wall.

     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-
     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down
     them.

     INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.
     He also wears the protective suit.

     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie
     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels
     provide the only illumination.

                              STANDARD
               I thought I'd find you here.

                              MELKONIS
               I was thinking of a line from an old
               poem: "Water, water everywhere, but
               not a drop to drink."  All that space
               out there, and we're trapped in this
               ship.

                              STANDARD
               That's the one about the albatross,
               right?

                              MELKONIS
               We can't even radio for help; the
               carrier wave wouldn't reach its
               destination till long after we'd
               died and turned to dust.  We are
               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can
               anybody really visualize such a
               scale of distances?  Halfway across
               Creation... 

                              STANDARD
               We came out there, we'll go back.  A
               long time by the clock, but a short
               time to us.

                              MELKONIS
               Time and space have no meaning out
               here.  We're living in Einsteinian
               equation.

                              STANDARD
               I can see you're putting your spare
               time to good use.
                    (leans forward and taps
                     him on the knee)
               Let me tell you something: you keep
               staring at hyperspace for long
               enough, they'll be peeling you off a
               wall.  I've seen it happen.

                              MELKONIS
                    (smiles at him)
               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We
               even have our own special diseases.

                              STANDARD
               Come on -- let's go above and see
               how they're coming with the gear.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of
     shimmering metallic netting.

     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.

                              HUNTER
               These have portable generators in
               them.  They're insulated down to here
               -- just be careful not to touch the
               end.

     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal
     object.  A blue spark leaps.

                              FAUST
               Might even incinerate the damn
               thing.

                              STANDARD
                    (sharply)
               I hope not.

                              HUNTER
               Don't worry, it won't damage it,
               it'll just give it a little
               incentive.

                              STANDARD
               How do we locate the creature?

                              FAUST
               With these.

     He picks up a small portable unit.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Tracking device.  You set it to
               search for a moving object... It
               hasn't got much range, but when you
               get within a certain distance, it
               starts beeping.

     Standard takes the device and studies it.

                              STANDARD
               These will be very useful.  At least
               we won't have to go digging around
               in closets with our bare hands.  All
               right, here's the battle plan: we're
               going to break into two teams and
               start systematically covering the
               ship.  Whoever finds it first,
               catches it in the net and ejects it
               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?

                              ROBY
               Even simple.

     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:

                              STANDARD
               For starters, let's make sure the
               bridge is safe.

     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.

                              FAUST
               It's clear.

                              STANDARD
               All right -- Roby and Melkonis will
               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will
               make up the second team.

     They start doling out the equipment.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               We'll all carry communicators.  We
               want to keep in constant touch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,
     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to
     side.

                              FAUST
               Nothing yet... nothing... we can move
               pretty fast as long as there's
               nothing on the tracker.

     INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS

     Standard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a
     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:

                              FAUST
               Hold it.

     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               I've got something.

     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.

                              ROBY
               Where's it coming from?

                              FAUST
                    (peers closely at tracker
                     and frowns)
               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
               Needle's spinning all over the dial.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it malfunctioning?

     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.

                              FAUST
               No, just confused.  It's coming from
               below us.

     They all look down at their feet.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal
     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the
     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.

     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading
     the net across the corridor.

                              ROBY
               Okay.

                              FAUST
                    (looking at tracker and
                     nodding down the passageway)
               That way.

     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw
     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.

                              ROBY
               What happened to the lights?

                              FAUST
               Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to
               replace 'em.

     They switch on the helmet lights.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Hold it.

     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               It's within 4 meters.

     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,
     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of
     approaching the source of the signal.

     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any
     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.

     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one
     wall.

     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets
     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,
     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod
     inside.

     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF
     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.

     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:

                              ROBY
                    (very annoyed)
               Oh, hold it!

     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and
     spitting, it scampers away.

                              MELKONIS
               We're making fools of ourselves!

     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              ROBY
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!
               Get up here fast!

                              ROBY
               Where are you?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Food-storage room!

                              ROBY
               We're coming!

     They dash for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive
     at:

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.

                              HUNTER
               We saw it inside and slammed the
               door on it!  It's in there now!

     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.

                              ROBY
               What's it doing, having a seizure?

                              STANDARD
               It started crashing around right
               after we locked it in.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               I guess we open the door and net it.

                              HUNTER
               I hate to open that door.

     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.

                              STANDARD
               It looks completely different from
               the first one -- it's more like a
               worm with legs... and tentacles.

                              FAUST
               Well we better do something.

                              HUNTER
               Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped
               in there.  We could just leave it in
               there all the way back to Irth.

                              STANDARD
                    (snaps)
               Don't be an idiot.

                              FAUST
               I know what we can do.  We can pump
               poison gas into the room and kill
               it.  Through those ventilator slots
               there.

     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.

                              ROBY
               Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our
               food supplies in there!  We can't
               pump poison gas all over them!

                              STANDARD
               Once we kill the thing we won't need
               the food any more -- we can go
               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it
               sounds like that thing is already
               doing a pretty good job on our
               supplies; it may be fouling them
               all.

                              ROBY
               You win.

                              FAUST
               Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the
               stuff.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER

     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-
     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.
     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large
     metal tank with pressure gauges.

                              STANDARD
               Get those masks on.

     They pull on gas masks.

                              ROBY
               This stuff's deadly -- I hope we
               know what we're doing.

                              STANDARD
               Go ahead, Jay.

     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas
     through the hose and into the room.

     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN
     BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.

     Then the sounds stop altogether.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Shut it off.

     Faust shuts off the pump.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               What do you think?  Now we go in.

     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows
     out.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in
     their gasmasks.

     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered
     all over the floor.

                              FAUST
               Looks like he helped himself.

     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.

     Then Hunter points.

                              HUNTER
               God damn it.

     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL
     HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
               It escaped.

     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.

                              ROBY
               Where does that go?

                              FAUST
               All over the ship; we'll have to
               check the charts to know for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Then let's go and do it.

     They head for the door.

                              HUNTER
               Have we got any food at all left in
               the ship?

     They slam the door shut and seal it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of
     ventilator shafts.

                              FAUST
               That one section of the ventilator
               shaft has only two outlets -- you
               notice?  The food storage room on one
               end --

                              HUNTER
               -- And the cooling unit on the
               other.

                              STANDARD
               So it's trapped in between -- now we
               have to drive it out.

                              FAUST
               Poison gas... 

                              HUNTER
               We can't pump poison gas down into
               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the
               whole ship!

                              STANDARD
               The only other thing I can think of
               is for somebody to crawl in there
               and flush it out.

                              ROBY
               Are you crazy?

                              STANDARD
               The man would need protection,
               obviously -- as well as some way to
               drive the thing before him.

                              FAUST
               How about a flamethrower?  That
               wouldn't poison the air.

                              MELKONIS
               So one of us goes into the airshaft
               and drives the thing along --

                              STANDARD
               While the rest of us wait down in
               the cooling unit with the net.

                              HUNTER
               Sounds like a rough one.

                              STANDARD
               Got a better idea?

     Hunter shrugs.

                              ROBY
               So the only question left is: who
               gets to crawl down the airshaft?

                              STANDARD
               Let's be democratic.

     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one
     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a
     tiny little ball.

     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table
     like dice.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Martin, take one.

     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.

     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.

     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They
     are both blank.

     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open it up, Cleave.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is
     helping him.

     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.

                              FAUST
               Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you
               won't need me, but if you do, I'm
               here.

                              HUNTER
                    (grimly)
               Right.

     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just
     large enough to crawl through.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     It is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his
     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.

                              HUNTER
               Hey, do you guys read me down there?

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum
     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run
     off in different directions.

                              STANDARD
               Yeah, we're getting into position.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Okay, I'm starting now.

     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a
     corner.

     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.

     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE
     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly
     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.

                              ROBY
                    (pointing)
               There.  That's where it's got to come
               out.

     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the
     opening.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               That's a flip-flop gate to channel
               the air, but we can use it to trap
               the thing.

                              STANDARD
               Right now let's keep it closed.

     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The
     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got Hunter... and something else
               as well, in front of him.

                              STANDARD
               Are they close?

                              MELKONIS
               They're on the next level up.

                              STANDARD
               Let's get moving with this net.

     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that
     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.

     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his
     flamethrower.

     Then he starts crawling down, head first.

     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning
     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.

     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.

     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is
     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up
     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.

     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal
     flaming burst toward the sound.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Melkonis is staring at his screen.

                              MELKONIS
               They're getting pretty close now.

                              STANDARD
               All right, then -- when it gets to
               the other side of the door, you sing
               out, then drop the door.  Okay?

                              MELKONIS
               Okay.

                              STANDARD
                    (to Roby)
               And you and I will bag it, and then
               we'll take it to the ventral air
               lock, got it?

                              ROBY
                    (tensely)
               Uh-huh.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the
     flamethrower.

                              HUNTER
                    (whispers)
               Hey, you guys.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
                    (whispering)
               I don't think this shaft goes on too
               much farther... anyway it's getting
               pretty hot in here... 

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Okay, our screens show you as being
               near to the opening.  We'll open it
               up, then we'll cue you and you can
               start blasting.  That'll drive it
               right out.  You don't have to go any
               farther.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Good.

     He readies the flamethrower.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
               Okay, get ready.

     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch
     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric
     prod.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open the vent, Sandy.

     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops
     down, opening up the shaft.

     A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND
     IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN
     OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.

     Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in
     one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN,
     THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK.

     CLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS
     DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING
     AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT.

     Standard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter
     climbs out of the shaft.

                              HUNTER
               What happened?  Where is it?

     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the
     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into
     darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (awed)
               How did it get so big?

                              ROBY
               By eating our food supplies.

                              HUNTER
               Where's Melkonis?

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Faust is still waiting.

                              FAUST
                    (into his communicator)
               Hey, are you guys still there?
               What's going on?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful --
               it's huge now.

                              FAUST
               Right.

     Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks
     the door behind him.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.

                              HUNTER
               You mean his body was still kicking
               when it ran off with him?

                              ROBY
               It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a
               chicken.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows
     shortly.  They all look blank, stunned.

                              FAUST
               What happened?  Where's Sandy?

                              ROBY
               Dead.

                              FAUST
               Dead!

                              ROBY
               It's monstrous -- it grew, like some
               horrible tapeworm.  We were
               completely unprepared.

                              FAUST
               It's still in the ship?

                              STANDARD
               We'd better seal off the lower
               maintenance level; at least trap it
               there.
                    (throws a switch;
                     circuitry lights up)

                              HUNTER
               At least it can't get up here now.

                              ROBY
               Two down, four to go.

                              STANDARD
                    (angrily)
               What's that supposed to mean?

                              ROBY
               Nothing.

                              HUNTER
               Listen, it sure didn't like this
               flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               That's right -- we can't kill it on
               the ship, but we can at least keep
               it at bay -- and maybe drive it into
               the air lock.

                              HUNTER
               Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.

                              FAUST
               There's some more combustible fuel
               down in the storage lockers next to
               the lounge.
                    (rises)
               I'll go get it.

                              STANDARD
               No, I don't want us separated.

                              FAUST
               You just sealed it off; it can't get
               to that section.

                              ROBY
               Don't count on it.

                              HUNTER
               We sure need this flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               All right... but do not go below
               decks.

                              FAUST
               Right.
                    (heads for the door)

                              STANDARD
               And be right back.

	Faust exits.

                              ROBY
               I think it's time we took a hard
               look at those heiroglyphs.

     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics
     appear on some of the screens.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Can you make out any pattern in all
               that?

                              STANDARD
                    (baffled)
               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but
               it's meaningless to me.

                              ROBY
               I know it looks like a senseless
               jumble, but if you look closely,
               there are recognizable forms.

                              HUNTER
               Recognizable!  In that?

                              ROBY
               In symbolic form... very stylized... 
               but if you stare at it, you can see
               some of the different creatures
               we've been dealing with.

                              HUNTER
               Well... I suppose that star-shaped
               thing could be the parasite that got
               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?

                              ROBY
               And right next to it, that oval
               design with the markings -- it's a
               dead ringer for the spore casings.

                              STANDARD
               That next thing there -- six legs,
               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw
               in the food locker.

                              ROBY
               So the next step should be --

                              HUNTER
               -- The big one.  And there it is.

     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible
     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.

                              ROBY
               This is all the same creature.  We're
               seeing the different stages in its
               life-cycle.

                              STANDARD
               Then that tomb... must have been some
               kind of fertility temple... where
               they stored their eggs, and maybe
               held mating rituals... 

                              HUNTER
               ... And Broussard got caught in their
               reproductive cycle.

                              ROBY
               You will notice, though, that there
               are no more phases.  Only four forms
               are shown.  After that the pattern
               repeats.

                              STANDARD
               Which presumably means... 

                              ROBY
               ... More spores coming.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt
     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN
     WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.

     He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE
     DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.

     Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a
     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall
     intercom and speaks into it.

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the lock -- blow the main
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from
     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.

                              STANDARD
                    (into intercom)
               What?

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind
     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature
     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-
     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.

     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,
     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.

     On the wall, a green light goes on:

                         "INNER DOOR CLOSED"

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches
     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.
     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock
     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into
     the vacuum under pressure.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is
     sucked out toward the lock.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:

                         "CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION"

     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control
     room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,
     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along
     by the air current.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds
     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt
     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,
     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.

     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running
     again.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the
     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his
     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound
     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.

     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a
     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch
     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.

     Done in, he collapses to the floor.

     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of
     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --
     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can
     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking
     underwater.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and
     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping
     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses
     bleed.

     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can
     only hear distant croaks.

     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others
     follow him.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM

     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging
     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen
     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.

     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening
     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL
     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the
     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.

     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.

                              ROBY
               How much oxygen did we lose?

     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.

                              STANDARD
               We've got six hours left.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Does anybody know what happened?

                              ROBY
               I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed
               in the air lock door.  His body held
               it open.

                              STANDARD
               Can we get to him?

                              ROBY
               No, I had to seal off a whole
               section.  We'd lose too much of our
               remaining air if we opened the
               connecting door.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the
     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.

     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.

                              ROBY
                    (picking up the cat)
               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.

                              STANDARD
               At least we're rid of the damn
               monster.  It must have been the first
               thing sucked out of the ship.

                              ROBY
               No such luck.  I saw it running down
               one of the corridors.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!
               There's only six hours of air left
               -- we're dead men!

                              STANDARD
               I don't buy that.  There's still time
               to destroy it and get ourselves in
               the freezers.

                              HUNTER
               How?

                              STANDARD
               It's time for drastic remedies.

                              ROBY
               It was time for that a couple days
               ago.

                              STANDARD
               That kind of remark is pointless.
               Now come on -- I want to hear every
               suggestion you can come up with, no
               matter how wild.

                              HUNTER
               We can't kill it on board.  It's huge
               now and must have tremendous amounts
               of that acid in its body.

                              ROBY
               I've got an idea, but you're not
               going to like it.

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
               Okay.  First we shut down all the
               cooling systems on the stardrive
               engines.

                              STANDARD
               That'll blow the ship up.

                              ROBY
               Right... but it'll take a few minutes
               for the engines to overheat and melt
               down the core.  In the meantime, we
               get in the lifeboat and leave the
               ship.

                              HUNTER
               Blow the ship up?

                              ROBY
               And the creature with it.  We can
               make it back to Irth in the
               lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               But the lifeboat can't accelerate to
               light speed.

                              ROBY
               Doesn't matter -- we're already at
               light speed.  And when we get back to
               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in
               the network.

                              HUNTER
               What about all the minerals and
               elements in the cargo hold?  That's
               the only reason we came out here.
               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd
               be broke.

                              ROBY
               Our lives are more important.
               Anyway, we can take a small amount
               of the most valuable stuff with us
               on the lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               No, it won't work and I just
               realized why.  There's only one
               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.
               Only one of us could survive.

                              ROBY
               Yeah... I forgot.

                              STANDARD
               But the idea's good, if we could
               just turn it around somehow.

     They think.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               If we could just get the creature
               into the lifeboat, we could launch
               it into space and blow it up.

                              HUNTER
               Good!  That's good!

                              STANDARD
               We can load the lifeboat up with
               explosives and trigger them
               remotely, once the lifeboat is in
               space.

                              ROBY
               I think it's going to be almost
               impossible to drive it up into the
               lifeboat.

                              HUNTER
               We can use the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               It's not going to work.

                              STANDARD
               You can't say that; I think it's a
               good plan.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower needs more fuel.

                              STANDARD
               Right.  We've got a lot to
               accomplish.  Let's get moving.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.
     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.

     LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS
     SHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.

                              HUNTER
               Which explosive should we use?

                              STANDARD
               I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're
               portable, and they can be radio
               detonated.

     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like
     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.

     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches
     one of them.

                              ROBY
               You know, it's funny -- this stuff
               we went to so much trouble to dig up
               -- this treasure, the paydirt --
               it'll make it back to Irth just fine
               -- even if we're not with it.

                              STANDARD
               Here, carry these.

     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.

                              ROBY
                    (grabbing at him)
               Hey watch it!

                              STANDARD
                    (grinning)
               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop
               it.

     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when
     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.

                              HUNTER
               Hold it!

     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and
     points the tracker around.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
                    (nodding up some steps)
               Up there.

     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks
     up the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               So what do we do?  Do we ignore it
               and finish loading the explosives
               into the boat -- or do we flush it
               out now?

                              STANDARD
               Now.  If we can get it into the boat,
               we won't have to blow it up -- we
               can just eject it into space.

     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.

     INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL

     Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.
     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.

     Then he continues up.

     EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up
     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.

     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS
     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the
     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass
     periodically.

                              STANDARD
                    (shouts)
               You can come up!  It's safe!

     The others come up the steps.

                              ROBY
                    (spying the corpse)
               Oh -- Jesus --

     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn
     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.

                              STANDARD
               The ship's gravitational attraction
               must have drawn him back.

                              HUNTER
                    (horrified)
               Should we go outside and bring him
               in?

                              STANDARD
               No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps
               after we've destroyed the thing.

     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard
     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and
     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This
     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.

     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the
     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an
     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and
     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount
     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               Along the base of the walls there.

     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls
     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.

                              HUNTER
               This should do it.

                              ROBY
               I should hope so!  And we'd better
               make sure it's pretty far from the
               ship when we blow it.

                              STANDARD
               It will be.

                              HUNTER
                    (surveys the craft uneasily)
               What we really need is some red meat
               in here for bait.

                              ROBY
               Well, if we had some, I'd eat it.
               I'm starting to get hungry.

     By this time, they are exiting.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

                              STANDARD
               Well... now we have to herd that
               thing up here.

                              HUNTER
                    (nervously)
               Whoever's doing the herding is gonna
               have their hands pretty full.  I
               think somebody should stay by the
               lifeboat to slam the door on the
               thing once it's inside, and to serve
               as... as... 
                    (searches for a word)

                              ROBY
               Isn't "bait" the word you used?

                              HUNTER
               Hey look, somebody has to have his
               hands free to lock the creature in
               the lifeboat!

                              STANDARD
               Yes, and maybe launch the boat and
               blow it too... if the others are
               injured.

                              ROBY
               Who gets the privilege?

     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.

     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see
     it.  It has a big X on it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device
     like a transistor radio.

                              HUNTER
               Just keep your finger off the button
               till she's way away from the ship,
               that's all.

                              ROBY
               Is it armed?

                              HUNTER
               If you press the button right now,
               it will blow the whole nose of the
               ship off.

                              ROBY
               Thanks for the thought.
                    (puts detonator in his
                     breast pocket)

                              STANDARD
               All right, Martin, we'll be in touch
               with you on the communicator.

                              ROBY
               And you'll let me know when you've
               got it coming this way... 

                              STANDARD
               And you stand aside while we drive
               it in, then shut the hatch, launch
               the boat, and --

                              ROBY
               Kablooey.

     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.

                              STANDARD
               Come on; we haven't much time, air
               is a factor.

     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,
     Hunter the tracker.

     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to
     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat
     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.

     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."

     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got something on the
               tracker... got to be it, it's
               too big for the cat.

     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO
     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               It's coming from down there.

     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,
     breathing, etc.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP

     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at
     the tracker.

                              HUNTER
               It must have stopped moving.  I'm not
               getting anything.

                              STANDARD
               Let me go first; you stay behind me.

     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS
     OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.

     HUNTER SCREAMS.

     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him
     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.

     Standard doesn't know what to do.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower!

                              STANDARD
               I can't, the acid will pour out!

     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN
     MORTAL AGONY.

     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires
     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER
     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.

     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of
     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the
     shrieks and crashing noises.

     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.

                              ROBY
               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?

     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his
     expression that he expects none.

     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has
     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other
     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He
     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.

     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps
     into the maintenance level.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that
     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he
     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.

     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,
     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.

     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the
     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.

     INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM

     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal
     ladder to the floor.

     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,
     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.

     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.

     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from
     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.

     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close
     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF
     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.

     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps
     violently.

                              STANDARD
                    (a feeble whisper)
               Kill me... 

                              ROBY
                    (sickened)
               What did it do to you?

                              STANDARD
                    (moves his head slightly)
               Look... 

     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles
     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller
     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE
     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... 

                              ROBY
                    (looking around for a tool)
               I'll get you out of there.

                              STANDARD
               No... don't... 

                              ROBY
               But I can save you -- get you to the
               Autodoc!

                              STANDARD
               No good... it's eaten too much of
               me... 

                              ROBY
                    (in horror)
               What can I do?

                              STANDARD
               Kill me... 

     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look
     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and
     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and
     scrambles back up the ladder.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.
     At length, he regains control of himself.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED

     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters
     rolling past in the infinite distance.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a
     little oxygen tank on it.

                              ROBY
               Kitty go bye-bye.

     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss
     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in
     front.  It YOWLS.

     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the
     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal
     cannisters.

                              ROBY
                    (reading from labels)
               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how
               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of
               it.  This'll buy us an island on some
               nice planet.

     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries
     back up the steps.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine
     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.

     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the
     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one
     by one.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  The cooling units for the
               stardrive engines are not
               functioning!  Engines will overload
               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!

     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he
     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overheat and
               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30
               seconds!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,
     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.

     INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY

     THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE
     LIFEBOAT.

     It HISSES and starts toward him.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws
     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the
     lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               4 minutes!

     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button.  The thing can
     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.

     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding
     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the
     ship as he sprints for the engine room.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes, 30 seconds!

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of
     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in
     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.

     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit
     switches.

     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes!

     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.

                              ROBY
               Computer!  I've turned all the
               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?

                              COMPUTER
               The reaction has proceeded too far.
               The core has begun to melt.  Engines
               will overload in 2 minutes, 35
               seconds.

     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time
     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               2 minutes!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where
     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward
     the passageway.

     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.

     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.
     Then he advances on the passageway.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the
     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on
     by the siren and the computer:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               90 seconds!

     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his
     head into the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is
     EMPTY.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.
     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               60 seconds!

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and
     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the
     seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.

     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE
     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates
     away from the mother ship.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of
     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly
     circumstances.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the
     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches
     his head down over it.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,
     until it is barely a point of light.

     THEN IT BLOWS UP.

     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL
     DIRECTIONS.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling
     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.

     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of
     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed
     in orange light.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away
     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of
     his ship and friends.

     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN
     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.

     The cat SCREECHES.

     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of
     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.

     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.

     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on
     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any
     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,
     with the door standing open.

     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.

     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker
     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face
     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that
     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is
     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.

     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It
     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.

     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE
     GLASS.

     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the
     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.

     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the
     catbox.

     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull
     it on.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see
     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing
     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it
     into a crevice in the wall.

     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the
     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the
     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.

     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.
     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.

     Again he raps on the glass.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

                              ROBY
               Try a little of this, you fucking
               bastard.

     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT
     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.

     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid
     begins to flow from the wound.

     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a
     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.

     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into
     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel
     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT
     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.

   

   

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing
     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't
     let go.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and
     yanks it.

     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END
     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.

     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,
     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is
     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:

                              "RAM JETS"

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the
     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN
     SHUT OFF.

     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a
     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.

     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --
     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all
     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling
     into infinity.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER

     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He
     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.

                              ROBY
                    (dictating)
               ... So it looks like I'll make it
               back to the Colonies on schedule
               after all.  I should be to the
               frontier in another 250 years or so,
               and then with a little luck the
               network will pick me up.  I'm not as
               rich as I was a couple days ago --
               but I'm not exactly broke either.
               Incidentally, I did manage to
               salvage one souvenir out of this
               whole mess.

     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls
     out the ALIEN SKULL.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Poor Yorick here should go at least
               partway toward proving I'm not a
               crank.  I wish it was him we'd met in
               the first place -- things might have
               turned out different.

     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               This is Martin Roby, executive
               officer, last survivor of the
               commercial vessel SNARK, signing off.
               Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.

     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,
     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.

     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against
     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER
     HIM.

     CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering
     Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth,
     250 years from now.

     As SNARK 2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that A SPORE POD IS
     ADHERED TO THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CRAFT.

                Story by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett


                      Screenplay by Dan O'Bannon





                                                                       1976






                              SYNOPSIS

     En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

FADE IN:

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital
     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.

     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic
     machinery chuckles softly to itself.

     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.
     Circuits close, lights blink on.

     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the
     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:

     INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT

     A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with
     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.

     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER
     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.

     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the
     freezers pop open.

     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.

                              ROBY
               Oh... God... am I cold... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Is that you, Roby?

                              ROBY
               I feel like shit... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, it's you all right.

     Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.

                              FAUST
                    (groans)
               Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.

                              BROUSSARD
               You look dead.

                              MELKONIS
               The vampires rise from their graves.

     This draws a few woozy chuckles.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (shakes his fist in the
                     air triumphantly)
               We made it!

                              HUNTER
                    (not fully awake)
               Is it over?

                              STANDARD
               It's over, Hunter.

                              HUNTER
                    (yawning)
               Boy, that's terrific.

                              STANDARD
                    (looking around with a grin)
               Well, how does it feel to be rich
               men?

                              FAUST
               Cold!

     This draws a LAUGH.

                              STANDARD
               Okay!  Everybody topside!  Let's get
               our pants on and get to our posts!

     The men begin to swing out of the freezers.

                              MELKONIS
               Somebody get the cat.

     Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.  There
     are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by
     viewscreens, all blank for the moment.

     There are seats for four men.  Each chair faces a console and is
     surrounded by a dazzling array of technology.

     STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their
     seats.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.

                              ROBY
                    (putting down the cat)
               Cattle ranch!

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm not kidding.  You can get one if
               you have the credit.  Look just like
               real cows, too.

                              STANDARD
               All right, tycoons, let's stop
               spending our credit and start
               worrying about the job at hand.

                              ROBY
               Right.  Fire up all systems.

     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control
     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights
     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills
     with the hum and chatter of machinery.

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, you want to give us some
               vision?

                              MELKONIS
               Feast your eyes.

     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The
     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.

     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (after a pause)
               Where's Irth?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, scan the whole sky.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a
     starfield.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,
     turning silently on its base.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on
     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.

     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
     "SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
     background of glimmering stars.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, contact traffic control.

     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.

                              MELKONIS
               This is deep space commercial vessel
               SNARK, registration number E180246,
               calling Antarctica air traffic
               control.  Do you read me?  Over.

     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (staring at a screen)
               I don't recognize that constellation.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, plot our location.

     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               I got it.  Oh boy.

                              STANDARD
               Where the hell are we?

                              BROUSSARD
               Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We
               haven't even reached the outer rim
               yet.

                              ROBY
               What the hell?

     Standard picks up a microphone.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we
               are not home.  Our present location
               seems to be only halfway to Irth.
               Remain at your posts and stand by.
               That is all.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, I've got something here on my
               security alert.  A high priority from
               the computer... 

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons)
               Computer, you have signalled a
               priority three message.  What is the
               message?

                              COMPUTER
                    (a mechanical voice)
               I have interrupted the course of the
               voyage.

                              ROBY
               What?  Why?

                              COMPUTER
               I am programmed to do so if certain
               conditions arise.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, this is Captain Standard.
               What conditions are you talking
               about?

                              COMPUTER
               I have intercepted a transmission of
               unknown origin.

                              STANDARD
               A transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               A voice transmission.

                              MELKONIS
               Out here?

     The men exchange glances.

                              COMPUTER
               I have recorded the transmission.

                              STANDARD
               Play it for us, please.

     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A
     STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN
     LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls
     silent.

     The men all stare at each other in amazement.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what language was that?

                              COMPUTER
               Unknown.

                              ROBY
               Unknown!  What do you mean?

                              COMPUTER
               It is none of the 678 dialects
               spoken by technological man.

     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.

                              STANDARD
                    (silencing them)
               Just hold it, hold it!
                    (glares around the room)
               Computer: have you attempted to
               analyze the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               Yes.  There are two points of salient
               interest.  Number one: it is highly
               systematized, indicating intelligent
               origin.  Number two: certain sounds
               are inconsistent with the human
               palate.

                              ROBY
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Well, it's finally happened.

                              MELKONIS
               First contact... 

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, can you home in on that beam?

                              MELKONIS
               What's the frequency?

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what's the frequency of
               the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               65330 dash 99.

     Melkonis punches buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got it.  It's coming from
               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,
               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

                              STANDARD
               Dell -- show me that on a screen.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll give it to you on number four.

     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a
     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               That's it.  Let me straighten it out.

     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in
     the center.

                              STANDARD
               Can you get it a little closer?

                              BROUSSARD
               That's what I'm going to do.

     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.

                              MELKONIS
               It's tiny!

                              STANDARD
               Any rotation?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah.  Two hours.

                              STANDARD
               Gravity?

                              BROUSSARD
               Point eight six.  We can walk on it.

     Standard rises.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, get the others up to the
               lounge.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and
     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.

                              MELKONIS
               If it's an S.O.S., we're morally
               obligated to investigate.

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

                              HUNTER
               I don't know.  Seems to me we came on
               this trip to make some credit, not
               to go off on some kind of side trip.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (excited)
               Forget the credit; what we have here
               is a chance to be the first men to
               contact a nonhuman intelligence.

                              ROBY
               If there is some kind of alien
               intelligence down on that planetoid,
               it'd be a serious mistake for us to
               blunder in unequipped.

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, we're equipped --

                              ROBY
               Hell, no!  We don't know what's down
               there on that piece of rock!  It
               might be dangerous!  What we should
               do is get on the radio to the
               exploration authorities... and let
               them deal with it.

                              STANDARD
               Except it will take 75 years to get
               a reply back.  Don't forget how far
               we are from the Colonies, Martin.

                              BROUSSARD
               There are no commercial lanes out
               here.  Face it, we're out of range.

                              MELKONIS
               Men have waited centuries to contact
               another form of intelligent life in
               the universe.  This is an opportunity
               which may never come again.

                              ROBY
               Look --

                              STANDARD
               You're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen
               -- let's go.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, I want greater magnification.
               More surface detail.  I want to see
               what this place looks like.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll see what I can do.

     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE
     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.

                              STANDARD
               It's out of focus.

                              ROBY
               No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud
               layer.

                              MELKONIS
               My God, it's stormy for a piece of
               rock that size!

                              ROBY
               Just a second.
                    (punches buttons)
               Those aren't water vapor clouds;
               they have no moisture content.

                              STANDARD
               Put ship in atmospheric mode.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - OUTER SPACE

     The great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main body
     of the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assumed
     an aerodynamic form.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Dell, set a course and bring us in
               on that beam.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the
     distant dot that is the planetoid.

     CAMERA APPROACHES THE PLANETOID, until it looms large on screen.  It is
     turbulent, completely enveloped in dun-colored clouds.

     The SNARK drops down toward the surface.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Activate lifter quads.

                              BROUSSARD
               Activated.  Vertical drop checked.
               Correcting course.  On tangential
               course now, orbiting.
                    (brief pause as he
                     studies his instruments)
               Crossing the terminator.  Entering
               night side.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - IN ORBIT

     Beneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet.

     Descending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmosphere
     of the planetoid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.

                              STANDARD
               Turn on navigation lights.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK"

     Hydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brilliant
     lights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improving
     visibility.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               Approaching point of origin.  Closing
               at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing.
               Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are
               directly above the source of the
               transmission.

                              STANDARD
               What's the terrain down there?

                              BROUSSARD
               Well, line of sight is impossible
               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.
               Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared --
               noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There.
               Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.

                              STANDARD
               Is it solid?

                              BROUSSARD
               It's... basalt.  Rock.

                              STANDARD
               Then take her down.

                              BROUSSARD
               Drop begins... now!  Fifteen
               kilometers and dropping... twelve... 
               ten... eight and slowing.  Five.
               Three.  Two.  One kilometer and
               slowing.  Lock tractor beams.

     There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.

                              ROBY
               Locked.

                              BROUSSARD
               Kill drive engines.

     The engines fall silent.

                              ROBY
               Engines off.

                              BROUSSARD
               Nine hundred meters and dropping.
               800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers
     above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.

     Landing struts unfold like insect legs.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               And we're... down.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the
     panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.

                              BROUSSARD
               Jesus Christ!

     The lights come back on again.

                              STANDARD
               What the hell happened?

                              ROBY
                    (hits a switch)
               Engine room, what happened?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Just a minute, hold it, I'm
               checking.

                              ROBY
               Has the hull been breached?

                              BROUSSARD
               Uh... 
                    (scans his gauges)
               No, I don't see anything.  We've
               still got pressure.

     There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then:

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are
               clogged with dust.  We overheated and
               burned out a whole cell.

                              STANDARD
                    (strikes his panel)
               Damn it!  How long to fix?

                              ROBY
                    (into microphone)
               How long to fix?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Hard to say.

                              ROBY
               Well, get started.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Right.  Talk to you.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take a look outside.  Turn the
               screens back on.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black.

                              BROUSSARD
               Can't see a blessed thing.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute
     darkness around it.

     THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING
     LIGHTS.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              STANDARD
               Kick on the floods.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     A ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light
     out into the night.

     They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and
     clouds of blowing dust.  The wind shrieks.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
               Not much help.

     Standard stares at the dark screens.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we can't go anywhere in this
               darkness.  How long till dawn?

                              MELKONIS
                    (consults his instruments)
               Well... this rock rotates every two
               hours.  The sun should be coming up
               in about 20 minutes.

                              BROUSSARD
               Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see
               something then.

                              ROBY
               Or something will be able to see us.

     They all look at him.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT (MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE)

     The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the
     darkness and the storm.  MAIN THEME MUSIC BEGINS, EXTREMELY OMINOUS.

     THE TITLE APPEARS:

                              ALIEN

     RUN TITLES.

     Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.  The
     silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect
     crouching motionless on the barren plain.  The floods shut off.  Dense
     clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and
     reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.

     END MAIN TITLES.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange
     dust.

     PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.  The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and
     Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee
     and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.

                              ROBY
               There could be a whole city out
               there and we'd never see it.

                              BROUSSARD
               Not sitting on our butts in here,
               that's for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any
               response yet?

                              MELKONIS
                    (pulls off his earphones)
               Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn
               transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've
               tried every frequency on the
               spectrum.

                              BROUSSARD
               Are we just going to sit around and
               wait for an invitation?

     Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console
     and speaks into the mike.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hello, Faust!

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Yeah!

                              ROBY
               How's it coming on the engines?

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking
     into a wall intercom.

                              FAUST
               I never saw anything as fine as this
               dust... these cells are all pitted on
               a microscopic level.  I have to
               polish these things smooth again, so
               it's going to take a while.  Okay?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.
                    (puts down the mike)

                              STANDARD
               Sandy... how far are we from the
               source of the transmission?

                              MELKONIS
               Source of transmission is to the
               northeast... about 300 meters.

                              ROBY
               Close... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Close enough to walk to!

                              STANDARD
               Martin, would you run me an
               atmospheric?

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons and
                     consults his panels)
               10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... 
               and some trace elements.

                              STANDARD
               Nontoxic... but unbreathable.
               Pressure?

                              ROBY
               Ten to the fourth dynes per square
               centimeter.

                              STANDARD
               Good!  Moisture content?

                              ROBY
               Zero.  Dry as a bone.

                              STANDARD
               Any microorganisms?

                              ROBY
               Not a one.  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Anything else?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we won't need pressure suits,
               but breathing masks are called for.
               Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of
               portable unit that we can use to
               follow that transmission to its
               source?

                              MELKONIS
               No problem.

                              BROUSSARD
               I volunteer for the exploration
               party.

                              STANDARD
               I heard you.  You want to break out
               the side arms?

     INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves,
     boots, jackets, and pistols.

     Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut,
     sealing them into the lock.

     They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks.

                              STANDARD
                    (adjusting the radio on his
                     mask)
               I'm sending.  Do you hear me?

                              BROUSSARD
               Receiving.

                              MELKONIS
               Receiving.

                              STANDARD
               All right.  Now just remember: keep
               away from those weapons unless I say
               otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Read you, Chaz.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Open the outer door.

     Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams
     into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE
     WIND OUTSIDE.

     A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it
     hits the ground.

     Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet.
     Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock.

     The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at
     their clothes.  Nothing can be seen.

                              STANDARD
               Which way, Sandy?

     Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.

                              MELKONIS
                    (pointing)
               That way.

                              STANDARD
               You lead.

     Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the
     others.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Martin.  We're on our way.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his
     console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a
     screen.

                              ROBY
               Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you
               on my board.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Good.  I'm getting you clear too.
               Let's just keep the line open.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and
     shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements,
     they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean.

     Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction
     finder.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Can't see more than three meters in
               any direction out here.  We're
               walking blind, on instruments.

     They wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               What's wrong?

                              MELKONIS
               My signal's fading.

     He studies the direction finder.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               It's the dust, it's interfering... 

     His concentration is so great that he does NOT NOTICE HUNTER COMING UP
     BEHIND HIM.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... Hold it, I've got it again.  It's
               over that way.

     Standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ROBY, Hunter speaks.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening?

     Startled out of his wits, Roby GASPS and whirls around to face Hunter.

                              ROBY
                    (startled silly)
               Hell!

     Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves into
     embarrassed anger.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men push their way through the storm.  Melkonis stops again,
     studies the direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               It's close, real close.

                              STANDARD
               How far?

                              MELKONIS
               We should be almost on top of it.  I
               just can't quite... 

     Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points.  The others stare
     in the direction he is pointing.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POINT-OF-VIEW

     Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out
     some kind of HUGE SHAPE.

     As we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHIP
     RISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL.  It is clearly of
     non-human manufacture.

     ANGLE ON THE MEN

     They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft.  Finally, Standard
     finds his voice.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, uh, we've found it.

                              ROBY
                    (sharply -- over, filtered)
               Found what?

                              STANDARD
               It appears to be some sort of
               spacecraft.  We're going to approach
               it.

     They start toward the alien ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               There are no signs of life.  No
               lights... no movement... 

     Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               We're, uh, approaching the base.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF TOADSTOOL SHIP - DAY

     A strangely shaped DOOR yawns open at the base of the ship.  Dust and
     sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.

     With great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Appears to be a door hanging open,
               the entrance is clogged with debris.

                              BROUSSARD
               Looks like a derelict.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to
               hold the conversation to a minimum
               from here on.

     INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY

     The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness,
     spewing dust.  In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless
     shapes.

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the
     doorway.  They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS",
     and step in.
Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct
     machinery.

                              MELKONIS
               Air lock?

                              STANDARD
               Who knows?

                              BROUSSARD
               Let's try and find the control room.

     As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls,
     ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.

                              MELKONIS
               Look at these holes.  This place
               looks like Swiss cheese.

     Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.

                              BROUSSARD
               This hole goes up several decks --
               looks like somebody was firing a
               military disintegrator in here.

     They all peer up the hole into darkness.

                              STANDARD
               Climbing gear.

     Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it.
     He aims it up into the hole and fires.

     The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There
     is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll go first.

                              STANDARD
               No, you'll follow me.

     Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and
     presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the
     hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.

     Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP

     This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the
     hole.

     Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a
     beam through the hanging dust.

     Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own
     light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.

     THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns
     of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes.

     Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it.

     It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings.
     Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is
     empty.

     Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have
     illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,
     SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.

     They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A
     GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.

                              MELKONIS
               Holy Christ... 

     Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton
     is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.

                              STANDARD
               Look at this... 

     They approach.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Something has been scratched here... 
               into the veneer.  See?

     Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a
     sharp instrument, is a small triangle:
Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the
     beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.

     Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.

                              MELKONIS
               LOOK OUT, IT MOVED!

     Standard knocks his hand down.

                              STANDARD
               Keep away from that gun!

     Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he
     begins to move toward the far side of the room.

     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.
     There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back
     and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Just machinery.

                              BROUSSARD
               But functioning.

     Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               That's where the transmission is
               coming from.

     He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a
     hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.

                              BROUSSARD
               A recording.  A damned automatic
               recording.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET

     SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color
     of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its
     wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly
     combatting the darkness and the storm.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching
     holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken
     by their "datasticks" (flashlight/cameras).

     Standard is commenting on the changing slides.

                              STANDARD
               ... This is the control room... 

     Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the
     suited men standing against banks of machinery.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... Some details of the control
               room... 

     The SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is the skeleton... another
               view of the skeleton... the
               transmitting device... 

     The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is a closeup of the triangle
               we found scrawled on the console in
               front of the skeleton... 

     Standard changes the slide.  The screen goes white.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... And that's it.

     He turns off the projector and brings the lights up.

                              HUNTER
               Phenomenal.  Staggering.

                              BROUSSARD
               We've got to go back and take a lot
               more pictures, holograph
               everything.

                              MELKONIS
               And bring back as much physical
               evidence as possible, too.  The rest
               of the skeleton.  Some of the
               machinery.  Written records, if there
               are any.

     Roby is slumped in his chair.  He has said nothing.

                              STANDARD
               Martin?

                              ROBY
               I agree.  This is the single most
               important discovery in history.

                              STANDARD
               But?

                              ROBY
               What killed it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, that thing's been dead for
               years.  Maybe hundreds of years.  The
               whole planet's dead.

                              FAUST
               The way I figure it, they landed
               here for repairs or something, then
               they couldn't take off again.  Maybe
               the dust ruined their engines.  They
               set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody
               came.  So they died.

                              ROBY
               He died.

                              FAUST
               What?

                              ROBY
               Not they... he... 

     They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod.  CAMERA MOVES
     OVER TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SKULL SITTING ON A TABLE.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               ... There was only one skeleton.

     There is a moment of silence.

                              STANDARD
               Jay... how's it coming on the
               repairs?

                              FAUST
               Well... I'm going to have to blow the
               engines out... 

                              STANDARD
               And when will you be ready to do
               that?

                              FAUST
               Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

                              STANDARD
               Then why the hell are you sitting
               around here?

                              FAUST
               Right.

     The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in
     thought, staring at the skull.  Melkonis lingers in the room with him.

                              MELKONIS
               And there sits man's first contact
               with intelligent life in the
               universe.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON THE SHIP, its spotlights cutting into the gloom.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     A room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of
     releasing unimaginable energies.

     Faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the
     engines, with spotlights on it.  He is wearing goggles and thin gloves.

                              FAUST
               You ready up there?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Broussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with
     Faust while they watch their instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure, we're ready.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

                              FAUST
               Okay.  I'm going to start the
               extraction procedure now.

     He pauses to wipe his brow.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the
     photographic slides on the screen.  He is clicking slowly through them.
     He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it.

     The alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him.  He
     picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it.

     Standard appears in the doorway.

                              STANDARD
               Alas, poor Yorick.

     Roby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (nodding at the screen)
               Find anything we missed?

                              ROBY
                    (shrugs)
               I don't even know what I'm looking
               for.

                              STANDARD
               Still worried?

                              ROBY
               Oh well... you know me.

                              STANDARD
               I've always respected your opinion,
               Martin.  If something worries you, it
               worries me.

     Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY
     DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL.

                              ROBY
               What would you say that was supposed
               to mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well... it's obviously intentional... 
               some kind of attempt at
               communication... maybe it's a symbol
               that means something to them... 

                              ROBY
               But why draw it on the wall?

     Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.

     He rises and goes to the coffee machine.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (picking a hair out of
                     the coffeepot)
               This ship is full of cat hair.

                              STANDARD
               Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as
               the engine's fixed --

     BEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and
     presses the button.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               This is Chaz.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come
               topside for a minute?

                              STANDARD
               What's up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Well, the sun just came up again,
               and it seems the wind's died down.
               It's as clear as a bell outside.
               There's something I think you ought
               to see.

                              STANDARD
               I'm on my way.

     He and Roby head for the door.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.

                              STANDARD
               What is it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Take a look.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               I was scanning the horizon to see
               what I could pick up.  Look there, on
               that screen.

                              STANDARD
               What is it, I can't --

     BLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image.

     The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon.

     They all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the
     PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien
     ship.
Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz.  All hands topside.
               Now.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     ANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA
     PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the
     room.

                              STANDARD
               Doesn't seem much doubt about it,
               does there?

                              MELKONIS
               That creature sure must have
               considered it important... using his
               last strength to draw it... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe they built it.

                              FAUST
               As what?

                              BROUSSARD
               A marker for buried instrumentation?

                              HUNTER
               Or a mass grave.

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe the rest of the crew is in
               there -- in some kind of suspended
               animation, waiting to be rescued.

                              MELKONIS
               It wasn't necessarily built by them.

     On the screens, a puff of DUST blows in front of the pyramid.

                              ROBY
               Here comes the dust again.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     WITH A SHRIEK, THE DUST STORM RETURNS, completely obscuring the SNARK.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Well, does anyone else agree with
               Martin that we should not explore
               it?

     Everyone looks around the room, but no one volunteers.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Then the sooner we get moving, the
               better.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     LONG SHOT OF THE STONE PYRAMID, dust blowing in front of it.  It is a
     crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless,
     tapering toward the top.

     Standard, Broussard, and Melkonis, wearing the protective suits,
     approach the pyramid.  As they draw near, it becomes clear that the
     pyramid is roughly 50 feet tall.

                              STANDARD
               We can't make out any details or
               features yet... but it's definitely
               too regular for a natural
               formation... 

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby and Hunter are present.  They are listening to Standard's VOICE ON
     THE RADIO.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... There's one thing I can say for
               sure though... 

     BUZZZZZ!  Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.

                              ROBY
               Now what's wrong?

                              HUNTER
               I've completely lost their signal.

                              ROBY
               Can you get them back?

                              HUNTER
               I'm trying.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The three men come to the base of the massive structure.  Dust and sand
     have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the
     base.

                              MELKONIS
               This looks ancient.

                              STANDARD
               Can't tell -- these weather
               conditions could erode anything,
               fast.

     They walk around the base.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's no entrance.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe the entrance is buried.  Could
               be under our feet.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe there is no entrance; the
               thing may be solid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Well, there ought to be some way we
               can get through to them --

     The INTERCOM BEEPS.  Faust's voice is heard.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna
               charge up the engines for a minute,
               okay?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.

     A LOUD, POWERFUL THROBBING BEGINS, drowning out all other sounds, as
     the engines are tested.

     A light on Roby's panel is FLASHING.  We can see that it is the
     COMPUTER ALERT.

     Irritably, Roby throws the switch.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Yes!

                              COMPUTER
               I have a temporary sequence on the
               monitor --

                              ROBY
               Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!

     He puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computer's voice over.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Go ahead!

     There is a PAUSE while Roby listens to the computer.  His eyes widen.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               You mean... you've translated it?

     Another PAUSE as he listens to the earphone.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Well come on, come on!  What does it
               say?

     Another PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His
     mouth works.

     Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE.

                              HUNTER
                    (looking over at Roby)
               What?  What was that?

                              ROBY
               The computer just translated the
               goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S.
               It was a warning.

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe we can get in by the top.

                              STANDARD
               You want to try?

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure.

     Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the
     top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               You guys just wait down here till I
               say it's okay to come up.

     Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side
     of the pyramid.

     OMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust
     blowing, the wind shrieking.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at
     the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's a hole at the top.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Can we come up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               No, it's too small, only room enough
               for one person.

                              STANDARD
               Can you see anything in the hole?

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness.

     Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on
     the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole.

                              BROUSSARD
               I can see... partway down.  It just
               goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth
               walls.  I can't see the bottom --
               light won't reach.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face.

                              FAUST
               Yes?  What is it?

                              ROBY
               Jay, we've got a problem.  I was
               wondering if there was any way you
               could shortcut the repairs and give
               us immediate takeoff capability.

                              FAUST
                    (quickly)
               Why, what's wrong?

                              ROBY
               The computer's translated the alien
               signal, and it's kind of alarming.

                              FAUST
               What do you mean?

                              ROBY
               It couldn't translate the whole
               thing, only three phrases.  I'll just
               read it to you the way I got it:
                    (reads from a strip of paper)
               "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO
               NOT LAND... "
                    (looks up at the others)
               And that's all it could translate.

     Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from

               Dell, you want to come down, we can
               figure out where to go from here.

                              BROUSSARD
               No, I want to go in.

     Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Dell, but just for a
               preliminary look-around.  Don't
               unhook yourself from your cable.  And
               be out in less than ten minutes.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

     Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He
     unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end
     of it to his chest unit.

     He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by
     the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Okay, I'm in the mouth of the
               chimney now, and I'm starting down.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Take care.

     Broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the
     hole.

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel,
     Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the
     depths.

     The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's noticeably warmer in here.  Warm
               air rising from below.

     He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops,
     pushing off each time with his feet.

     He stops to catch his breath.  His breathing rasps loudly in his
     helmet.

     A little sunlight filters down from above.  Looking up, he can see the
     mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light.

     Standard's voice comes over his earphones.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Are you okay in there?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (gasping for breath)
               Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom
               yet.  Definitely a column of warm air
               rising; it keeps the shaft clear of
               dust.

                              STANDARD

               What was that Dell, I lost you, do

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't
               talk now.

     He kicks off and continues down, taking longer and longer hops as he
     gains confidence.

     Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               I'm way below ground level.

     Roby and Hunter.

                              HUNTER
               I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area
               around the pyramid is dead to
               transmission.  I think we should go
               after them.

                              ROBY
               No.

                              ROBY
               We can't spare the personnel.  We've

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard resumes his downward climb.  SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR
     PURCHASE AS THE WALLS OF THE SHAFT DISAPPEAR.

     The tunnel has reached its end.  Below him is an unfathomable,
     cavernous space.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (huffing and puffing)
               Tunnel's gone -- cave or something
               below me -- feels like the tropics
               in here; air is warm and humid... 
                    (consults his instruments)
               ... high oxygen content, no dust,
               it's completely breathable --

     Puffing with exertion, he releases his purchase on the stone walls and
     begins to lower himself on power.  Now he is dangling free in darkness,
     spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds.

     Finally, his feet hit bottom.  He grunts in surprise and almost loses
     his balance.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - DAY

     Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of
     sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above.  Around is
     solid darkness.

     He flashes his datastick around.  The beam reveals that he is in a
     stone room.  STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls.  They have
     a primitive, religious appearance.  Row after row of pictograms stretch
     from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language.  Huge
     religious symbols dominate one wall.

     Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque
     monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's unbelievable!  It's like some
               kind of tomb... some primitive
               religion!  Hey, is anybody there?  Do
               you read me?  Standard!

     Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them
     hanging around his neck.  He takes a deep breath of the wet air.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - LATE AFTERNOON

     Standard and Melkonis are standing around nervously.

                              STANDARD
               If we don't hear from him soon, I
               think we better go in after him.

                              MELKONIS
               Sun will be down in a minute.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON

     Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is
     dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF
     LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS
     IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED.

     He walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He
     shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.

     He lifts his mask radio to his lips.

                              BROUSSARD
               I don't know if you can hear me, but
               the place is full of large bottles
               or jars, just like the one we found
               on the other ship -- except these
               are all sealed.  Also they're soft to
               the touch.

     He peers more closely at the leathery object.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Another funny thing -- I just put my
               hand on it, and now there are these
               raised areas appearing where my
               fingertips were.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     THE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom.
     Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights.

                              STANDARD
               Let's go.

     He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT

     Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the
     wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters.

     He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he
     turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN
     THE TOP OF IT.

     He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn."  There lies
     the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and
     studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside
     surface is spongy and irregular.

     Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn."

     He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITH
     SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES
     ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.

     With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the
     thing with his hands.
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT

     The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top,
     lights bobbing in the darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (puffing with exertion)
               Here's his line.  We can haul him out
               of there if we have to.

                              MELKONIS
               It'll yank him right off his feet if
               he's not expecting it.  The line
               could get tangled in something.

                              STANDARD
               But what can we do?  He's out of
               radio contact.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we should just wait a few more
               minutes.

     Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.

                              STANDARD
                    (making up his mind)
               No, I told him to be out in ten
               minutes.  It's been much longer.
               Let's get him out of there.

     Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the
     tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which
     Broussard's line dangles.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               The line's slack.  Christ, do you
               think the idiot unhooked himself?

     He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the
     line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the
     motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               There, it caught!

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still coming up, or is it
               hooked on something?

                              STANDARD
               No, it's coming.

                              MELKONIS
               Can you see anything?

     Standard shines his light down into the hole.

                              STANDARD
               No, I can't see far enough.  The
               line's moving, though.

     For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid,
     saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls.
     Then Standard shines his light back down in.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I can see him!  Here he comes!

     The winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Get ready to grab him!

     Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the
     wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Look out!  There's something on
               his face!

     Melkonis attempts to come to his aid.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               Don't touch him, watch it!

     In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally
     regain their balance.  They shine their lights on Broussard.

     He appears to be completely unconscious -- AND THE OCTOPUS THING IS
     STILL WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACE, MOTIONLESS.

                              MELKONIS
               Oh God, oh God no.

                              STANDARD
               Help me -- I'm going to try to get
               it off.

     With his gloved hands, Standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to
     pull it from Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It won't come -- it's stuck.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               How the hell should I know?  Come on,
               give me a hand, let's get him out of
               there!

     The two men grapple with Broussard's limp body, lifting him from the
     hole.

     Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.  There is a long moment
     while nothing is said, then:

                              HUNTER
               I've got 'em!  They're back on my
               screens!

                              ROBY
                    (leaps to his feet)
               How many?

                              HUNTER
               Three blips!  They're coming this
               way!

     Roby grabs a microphone.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hey, can you guys hear me?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming
               back!

                              ROBY
               Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen,
               there's been a new development --

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Can't talk now; Broussard's injured.
               We'll need some help getting him
               into the ship.

     Roby collapses into a chair, suddenly limp with apprehension.  He's
     feared something like this all along, and now it has begun to happen.

                              ROBY
                    (to himself)
               Oh no.

                              HUNTER
                    (into intercom)
               Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the
               main air lock!

     Hunter dashes from the room.

     Roby remains where he is, seated at his console.  He is stunned, his
     mind racing.  CAMERA MOVES IN ON HIS FACE.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     Hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock
     door.

     He presses the wall intercom.

                              HUNTER
                    (into intercom)
               Martin, I'm by the inner lock door!
               I'll wait here for you to let them
               in!

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
                    (strangely quiet)
               Right.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     Faust comes running up, covered with grime.

                              FAUST
               What the hell's going on?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- Broussard got hurt
               somehow.

                              FAUST
               Hurt!  How?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- maybe we'll be real
               lucky and he just broke his neck.
                    (a beat)
               I knew we shouldn't of come down
               here.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Roby is seated alone in the room, listening to the transmission from
     Standard and Melkonis.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, are you there?

     Roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone.

                              ROBY
               Here, Chaz.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We're coming up now, open the outer
               lock door.

                              ROBY
               Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               It's some kind of organism, it's
               attached itself to him.  Let us in.

     Roby does not reply.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer
               door.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, if it's an organism, and we
               let it in, the ship will be
               infected.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We can't leave him out here, open
               the door.

                              ROBY
                    (urgently)
               Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken
               every rule of quarantine.  If we
               bring an organism on board, we won't
               have a single layer of defense left.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is an order!  Open the
               door!

     Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     A RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large
     servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK.

                              HUNTER
               Outer door's open.

     After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another
     CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off.

     The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through,
     carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust
     follows them out of the lock.

                              STANDARD
                    (pulling off his mask)
               You men stay clear, there's a
               parasite on him.

     Hunter and Faust RECOIL.

                              HUNTER
               Oh -- God -- oh --

                              FAUST
               Is it alive?

                              STANDARD
               I don't know but don't touch it.
               Give us a hand here, let's get him
               up to the Autodoc.

     Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the
     medical room, carrying Broussard.

     Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with
     machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed,
     which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.

                              STANDARD
               Help me, come on, let's get him up
               here.

     They slide the man onto the bunk.

                              HUNTER
               That thing, God almighty, didn't you
               try to get it off him?

                              STANDARD
               It wouldn't come.

     Standard yanks off his gloves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Medical gloves.

     They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull
     them on.

     Gingerly, they approach Broussard.

     Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing
     on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to
     pull it free.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It's really on there tight.

                              FAUST
               Here, let me try.

     Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip
     of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his
     weight.

                              STANDARD
                    (grabbing Faust's hands)
               Stop it, you're tearing his face.

     A trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek.

                              MELKONIS
               It's not coming off -- not without
               his whole face coming off too.

                              STANDARD
               Let's let the machine work on him.

     Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a
     couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard
     is sucked into the slot in the wall.

     He is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of
     disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.

     A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different
     parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.

     ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.

     Standard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard
     each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE
     FACE.

     The others are shocked.

                              HUNTER
               Hey now, what is this?

                              STANDARD
               Ask him.

                              ROBY
                    (slowly puts his hand
                     to his cheek)
               I understand why you did that.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

                              MELKONIS
               He wouldn't open the lock; he was
               going to leave us out there.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I
               mean, you brought the goddamn thing
               in here.  Maybe you deserve to get
               slapped.

                              FAUST
                    (embarrassed)
               Excuse me, I've got work to do.

     Faust exits.

                              HUNTER
               I keep my mouth pretty much shut,
               but I don't like hitting.

                              ROBY
                    (to Standard)
               I guess I had it coming.  Let's call
               it settled.

     After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns
     his attention to the machinery.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (slowly)
               Would somebody fill me in?

                              STANDARD
               He went into the pyramid alone.  We
               lost radio contact with him.  When we
               pulled him out, it was on his face.
               It won't come off, not without
               injuring him.

                              HUNTER
               Where did it come from?

                              MELKONIS
               He's the only one that knows that.

                              HUNTER
               How does he breathe?

     They study the monitors.

                              MELKONIS
               Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth
               are blocked.

                              STANDARD
               Let's look inside his head.

     Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray
     image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER
     TORSO.

     The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the
     creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is
     that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open,
     and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED
     INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.

                              ROBY
               Look at that.

                              HUNTER
               What is it -- I can't tell
               anything --

                              ROBY
               It's some kind of organ -- it's
               inserted some kind of tube or
               something down his throat.

                              HUNTER
                    (turning sick)
               Oh... God... 

     Hunter bends over and RETCHES.

                              ROBY
               I think that's how it's getting
               oxygen to him.

                              HUNTER
               It doesn't make any sense.  It
               paralyzes him... puts him into a
               coma... then keeps him alive.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't expect to understand a life
               form like this.  We're out of our
               back yard.  Things are different
               here.

                              HUNTER
               Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we
               can't leave the damn thing on him.

                              MELKONIS
               We don't know what might happen if
               we tried to kill it.  At least right
               now it's keeping him alive.

                              HUNTER
               How about cutting it off?  We can't
               pull it loose, but we can cut off
               everything but the bottom layer,
               where it's stuck to his face.

                              STANDARD
               You're right... we can't stand here
               and do nothing.

     Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head.
     Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch
     and Broussard slides back out of the booth.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled in his mask)
               Somebody give me a scalpel.

     Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall,
     and carefully passes it to Standard.

     Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his
     hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button
     with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum.

     Standard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously.
     Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and
     holds it inconspicuously at his side.

     Standard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to
     the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the
     back of Broussard's head.

     Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue.
     Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               I've made an incision... it's not
               reacting... but some kind of
               yellowish fluid is leaking out of
               the wound... 

     The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to
     Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of
     smoke curls up from the stain.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               Hold it, this stuff's smoking!

     The others REACT nervously.

     By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has
     dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble
     and sizzle, and more smoke rises.

     The men start to COUGH.

                              MELKONIS
               God, that smoke's poisonous!

                              HUNTER
                    (pointing)
               It's eating a hole in the floor!

     Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the
     corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.

     Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a
     bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and
     in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They
     begin to smoke.

     Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves.
     Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

                              STANDARD
               That stuff's eating right through
               the metal!  It's going to eat through
               the decks and right out through the
               hull!

     By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to
     the level below.

                              STANDARD
               There!  Look!

     A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and
     drips to the floor.

     It bubbles on the floor.

                              MELKONIS
               Jesus, what can we put under it?

     Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below.

     INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW

     Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at
     the ceiling.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               There.  Should be coming through
               about there.

                              HUNTER
               Careful, don't get under it!

     INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE

     Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid
     sizzles.

                              MELKONIS
               Christ, that stinks.

     Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the
     floor.

                              ROBY
               Seems to have stopped penetrating.

     Hunter comes charging up the steps.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening up here?

                              ROBY
               I think it's fizzled out.

     Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the
     pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by
     the end.

                              MELKONIS
               I never saw anything like that in my
               life... except molecular acid.

                              HUNTER
               But this thing uses it for blood.

                              MELKONIS
               Hell of a defense mechanism.  You
               don't dare kill it.

     Standard comes up the stairs.

                              STANDARD
               It's stopped?

                              MELKONIS
               Yes, thank heaven.

                              STANDARD
               We're just plain lucky.  That could
               have gone right through the hull --
               taken weeks to patch it.

                              MELKONIS
               Reminded me of when I was a kid and
               the roof leaked -- everybody running
               for the pots and pans.

                              ROBY
               My God, what about Broussard?

     They turn and run up the stairs.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen).
     Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.

                              ROBY
               Did it get on him?

     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD
               No, thank God... just missed him.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still dripping?

                              STANDARD
                    (examining it)
               It appears to have healed itself.

                              HUNTER
               It makes me sick to see him like
               that.

                              MELKONIS
               Isn't there some way we can get it
               off him?

                              STANDARD
               I don't see how.  But let's do what
               we can for him.

     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the
     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up
     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think we'd better get some
               intravenous feeding started.  God
               knows what that thing is leaching
               out of him.

     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade
     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.

                              ROBY
                    (studying the screens)
               Look there, what's that stain on his
               lungs?

     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's
     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.

                              MELKONIS
               It appears to be a heavy fluid of
               some sort... it blocks the X-rays... 

                              ROBY
               That tube must be depositing it in
               him.

                              MELKONIS
               Could be some kind of venom, or
               poison... 

                              HUNTER
               This is horrible.

                              ROBY
               Hey!  what about the film?

                              STANDARD
               What film?

                              ROBY
               Broussard had film in his datastick,
               didn't he?  We can see what happened
               to him.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Again we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,
     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs
     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.

     The camera reveals the "urns."  The climax of the sequence of stills
     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA --
     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to
     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.

                              HUNTER
               That must have been when he got it.

                              ROBY
               The same thing must've happened to
               the creatures on the other ship... 
               except they took one of those jars
               on board, and opened it there.

                              MELKONIS
                    (clicks back through the
                     slides to a picture of
                     one of the "urns")
               At first I thought they were jars
               too, or artifacts anyway.  But
               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore
               casings.  Let's go back to the
               heiroglyphics.

     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a
     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of
     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.

                              STANDARD
               I personally can't make any sense
               out of it... 

     CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing
     different angles on the glyphs.

                              MELKONIS
               It's a crude symbolic language --
               looks primitive.

                              HUNTER
               You can't tell -- that kind of stuff
               could represent printed circuits... 

                              STANDARD
               That sounds a little fanciful... 

                              MELKONIS
               Primitive pictorial languages are
               based on common objects in the
               environment, and this can be used as
               a starting point for translation... 

                              ROBY
               What common objects?

                              HUNTER
               Listen, hadn't somebody better check
               on Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (rising)
               I'll do it.  The rest of you
               continue.

                              HUNTER
                    (rising)
               I'll come with you.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

     Standard and Hunter come down the passageway.

                              STANDARD
               You know, it's fantastic -- the
               human race has gone this long
               without ever encountering another
               advanced life form, and now we run
               into a veritable zoo.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well, those things out there aren't
               the same, you know -- the spaceship
               and the pyramid.  They're from
               different cultures and different
               races.  That ship just landed here --
               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and
               the thing from it are indigenous.

                              HUNTER
               How could anything be indigenous to
               this asteroid?  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe it wasn't always dead.

     They arrive at the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     The door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates
     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.

     THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.

                              HUNTER
               It's gone.

     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS
     FACE.

     Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE IS
     COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.

                              HUNTER
               Now we're in for it.

                              STANDARD
               The door was closed.  It must still
               be in here.

     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the
     door.  Standard grabs his arm.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               No, don't open the door.  We don't
               want it escaping.

                              HUNTER
                    (very nervous)
               Well, what the hell good can we do
               in here?  We can't grab it -- it
               might jump on us --

                              STANDARD
               Maybe we can catch it.

     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               As long as we're careful not to
               damage it... 

     Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly
     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.

     He bends down and peers under the bunk.

     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE
     THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.

     He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO
     THE FLOOR.

                              STANDARD
                    (leaping back)
               Shit!

     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its
     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.

     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and
     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not
     respond.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think it's dead.

     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite
     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.

     INTERIOR - LABORATORY

     Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a
     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.

     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.

                              STANDARD
               Look at these suckers -- no wonder
               we couldn't get it off him.

                              ROBY
               Is that its mouth?

                              MELKONIS
               More likely that organ -- the tube-
               like thing -- fits up in there.

     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy
     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.

                              ROBY
               Ugh.

     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.

                              STANDARD
               Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme
               something to grab it with!

     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.

     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at
     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes
     the thing in the tongs.

     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Christ!  Let's get it out of here!

     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing
     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the
     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is
     already on the intercom:

                              ROBY
                    (shouts into intercom)
               For Chrissake, open the main lock!

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the
     thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed
     by the inevitable dust.

     Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY

     The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust,
     smouldering and fuming.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     The outer door rolls shut.

                              ROBY
                    (slumping against the
                     wall)
               My God, it's lethal even when it's
               dead!

     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in
     the floor.

     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,
     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              HUNTER
                    (over intercom,
                     filtered)
               Yes?

                              STANDARD
               How's Broussard?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               He's running a fever.

                              STANDARD
               Still unconscious?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               Yes.

                              STANDARD
               Can you do anything for him?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               The machine will bring his
               temperature down.  His vital
               functions are strong.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

     He switches off the intercom.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (suddenly exhausted)
               I need some coffee.

     He turns and walks away.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats;
     Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.

                              MELKONIS
               These day and night cycles are
               totally disorienting.  I feel like
               we've been here for days, but it's
               only been how long?

                              ROBY
                    (stroking the cat)
               About four hours.

                              STANDARD
                    (staring into his coffee
                     cup)
               I'm sorry to say it looks like you
               were right in the first place,
               Martin.  We never should have landed
               here.

                              ROBY
               Look, I'm not trying to rub
               anybody's nose in anything.  The
               important thing is just to get away
               from here as fast as possible.

                              STANDARD
               I can't lean on Faust any harder --
               he's been working non-stop on the
               engines.

                              ROBY
               If we knew exactly what happened to
               the beings on the other ship --

                              MELKONIS
               We do know that.

                              ROBY
               Yeah?

                              MELKONIS
               They never made it off the planet.
               The parasites won.

     This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.

                              ROBY
               Where did the parasites come from?

                              STANDARD
               They seem native to the planet.  It's
               got an atmosphere and a dense
               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it
               must have been fertile.

                              MELKONIS
               No.  It's just too small to support
               fauna as big as the parasites.  If
               there were a native ecology, it
               would have to be microscopic.

                              ROBY
               Couldn't the pyramid have been built
               here by space travellers?

                              STANDARD
               Too primitive.  It's a pre-
               technological construction.  That
               slab was engineered by an Iron-Age
               culture at best.

                              MELKONIS
               They're from a dead civilization;
               they're spores from a tomb.  God
               knows how long they've been here.

                              ROBY
               I think we better take another look
               at those heiroglyphs.

     Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in.  He is covered
     with dirt and grime.

                              FAUST
               Hey, guess what?

                              STANDARD
               What?

                              FAUST
               The engines are fixed.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OUT
     STREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust.

     The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited
     power.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     They are all at their posts.

                              STANDARD
               Switch on tractor beams.

     There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whole
     ship, and it begins to float, like a cork in water.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Lock tractor beams.

     The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Retract landing struts.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force.
     The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Take us up.

                              ROBY
                    (into intercom)
               Up one kilometer, Jay.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Switch on lifter quads.

     A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - DAY

     The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking
     atmosphere.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Engage artificial gravity.

     Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.

                              ROBY
               Engaged.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take her into an escape orbit.

     The men get busy with switches.

                              ROBY
               I'm altering our vector now; should
               give us an easy escape velocity --

     A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              ROBY & MELKONIS
                    (in concert)
               What was that?

     In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               This dust is getting clogged in the
               intakes again!

                              STANDARD
               Just hold us together till we're in
               space, that's all!

     The pitch of the engines changes, deepens.

     EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY

     The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds.
     Visibility is zero.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning
     to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to
     suck up some of the dust.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS
     THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim,
     set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically
     they mutter technical instructions to each other.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT
     INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They all CHEER.

                              ROBY
                    (pounds his panel)
               We made it!  Damn, we made it!

                              STANDARD
               You bet we made it.  Martin, set
               course for Irth and accelerate us
               into stardrive.

                              ROBY
               With great pleasure.

     Roby begins to punch buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I feel like an escapee from Hell.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER

     The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the
     universe all around.

     There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching
     the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red.  This is
     redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They are unstrapping.

                              ROBY
               That's the part that always makes me
               feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we
               accelerate into light speed.

                              STANDARD
               Quit complaining; we're in space.

     They rise and head out of the room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     As they walk along.

                              STANDARD
               I think the best thing to do with
               Broussard is to just freeze him as
               he is.  It'll arrest the progress of
               his disease, and he can get complete
               medical attention when we get back
               to the Colonies.

                              ROBY
               We'll have to go into quarantine,
               maybe for quite a while.

                              STANDARD
               That's okay, he can remain in
               hypersleep until they're ready to
               treat him.

     They enter the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP
     in BED -- AWAKE.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (hoarsely)
               ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some
               water... 

     Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it
     down in a swallow.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               More.

     Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard,
     who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the
     bunk.

                              STANDARD
                    (softly)
               How do you feel, Dell?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (weakly)
               Wretched.  What happened to me?

                              STANDARD
               Don't you remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly
               remember my name.

                              ROBY
               Are you in pain?

                              BROUSSARD
               Not exactly, just feel like
               somebody's been beating me with
               rubber hoses for about six years.

     Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him.

                              STANDARD
               Hell, you're in great shape, you've
               got your sense of humor back!

                              BROUSSARD
               God I'm hungry.

                              ROBY
               Dell, what's the last thing you can
               remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               ... I don't know... 

                              ROBY
               Do you remember the pyramid?

                              BROUSSARD
               No.  Just some horrible dreams about
               smothering.  Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               We're going home.  We're in
               hyperspace.

                              MELKONIS
               We're going into the freezers now.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm really starving; can we get some
               food before we go into the freezers?

                              STANDARD
                    (laughs)
               I think that's a pretty reasonable
               request.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions
     greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table.

                              HUNTER
               Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a
               straight shot back to the Colonies,
               and then we can start taking bids on
               the paydirt.  Any bets on the top
               bid?

                              FAUST
                    (chewing)
               Well, we should at least be able to
               each buy our own planet.

     They all CHUCKLE.

                              MELKONIS
               I'm going to write a book about this
               expedition.  I'm going to call it
               "The Snark Log."

                              STANDARD
                    (stiffly)
               The commander normally has first
               publication rights.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we could write it together.

                              ROBY
               First thing I'm going to do when we
               get back is eat some biological
               food.

                              MELKONIS
               What's the matter, you don't like
               this stuff?

                              ROBY
               Tastes like something you'd feed a
               chicken to make it lay more eggs.

                              STANDARD
               Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag
               than this, but I've had worse too,
               if you know what I mean.

                              FAUST
               I kind of like it.

                              ROBY
               You like this shit?

                              FAUST
               It grows on you.

                              ROBY
               You know what they make this stuff
               out of?

                              FAUST
                    (annoyed)
               Yes, I know what they make it out
               of, so what?  It's food now.  You're
               eating it.

                              ROBY
               I didn't say it was bad for you,
               it's just kind of sickening, that's
               all.

                              HUNTER
               Do we have to talk about this kind
               of crap at the dinner table?

     Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.

                              STANDARD
               What's wrong?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (his voice straining)
               I don't know... I'm getting these
               CRAMPS!

     The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles
     whitening.

                              STANDARD
               Breathe deeply.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (screaming)
               OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!

                              ROBY
               What Dell -- what?

     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is
     trembling violently from head to foot.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (incoherent shriek)
               OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!

     A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.

     THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS
     TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A
     MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.

     Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and
     bolts.

     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's
     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood
     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and
     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.

     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,
     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with
     blood and slime.

                              HUNTER
               Oh, no.  Oh, no.

                              FAUST
               What was that?  What the Christ was
               that?

                              MELKONIS
               It was growing in him the whole time
               and he didn't even know it!

     Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.

                              ROBY
               That thing used him for an
               incubator!

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped
     body tumbles silently out.

     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into
     eternity.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't go into hypersleep with
               that thing running around loose.

                              HUNTER
               We'd be sitting ducks in the
               freezers.

                              ROBY
               But we can't kill it.  If we kill it,
               it will spill all its body acids
               right through our hull and out into
               space.

                              FAUST
               Shit... 

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to catch it and eject it
               from the ship.

                              MELKONIS
                    (sighs)
               Well, I kind of hate to point it
               out, but all our supplies are based
               on us spending a strictly limited
               amount of time out of suspended
               animation... and as you know, we used
               up most of that time in harvesting.

                              STANDARD
               We've got about a week left, right?

                              HUNTER
               And then we run out of food and
               oxygen.

                              FAUST
               The water will still recycle.

                              ROBY
               We won't need it then.

                              STANDARD
               All right, so that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's plenty of time.

                              ROBY
               But if we haven't caught it in a
               week, then we have to go into the
               freezers anyway.

     They enter the bridge.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               So does anybody have any
               suggestions?

                              FAUST
               We could put on our pressure suits
               and blow all the air out of the
               ship.  That would kill it.

                              STANDARD
               No, we can't afford to lose that
               much oxygen.  We're going to have to
               flush it out.

                              MELKONIS
               How?

                              STANDARD
               Room by room, corridor by corridor.

     No one likes this thought.

                              MELKONIS
               And what do we do when we find it?

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we
               had a really strong piece of net, we
               could bag it.

                              FAUST
               We could cut a section out of that
               metallite netting.  It won't hold up
               to that acid, but aside from that
               it's pretty strong.

                              ROBY
               We have to avoid injuring it.  What
               we really need is some electric
               animal prods.

                              HUNTER
               I think I could cobble something
               together.  A long metal rod with a
               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a
               shock.

                              STANDARD
               Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm
               issuing a standing order: from this
               moment forth, every one of us will
               wear protective garments, including
               helmets.  Let's get down to the
               locker and change.

     They start for the exit.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is
     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot
     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.

     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different
     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical
     wall.

     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-
     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down
     them.

     INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.
     He also wears the protective suit.

     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie
     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels
     provide the only illumination.

                              STANDARD
               I thought I'd find you here.

                              MELKONIS
               I was thinking of a line from an old
               poem: "Water, water everywhere, but
               not a drop to drink."  All that space
               out there, and we're trapped in this
               ship.

                              STANDARD
               That's the one about the albatross,
               right?

                              MELKONIS
               We can't even radio for help; the
               carrier wave wouldn't reach its
               destination till long after we'd
               died and turned to dust.  We are
               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can
               anybody really visualize such a
               scale of distances?  Halfway across
               Creation... 

                              STANDARD
               We came out there, we'll go back.  A
               long time by the clock, but a short
               time to us.

                              MELKONIS
               Time and space have no meaning out
               here.  We're living in Einsteinian
               equation.

                              STANDARD
               I can see you're putting your spare
               time to good use.
                    (leans forward and taps
                     him on the knee)
               Let me tell you something: you keep
               staring at hyperspace for long
               enough, they'll be peeling you off a
               wall.  I've seen it happen.

                              MELKONIS
                    (smiles at him)
               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We
               even have our own special diseases.

                              STANDARD
               Come on -- let's go above and see
               how they're coming with the gear.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of
     shimmering metallic netting.

     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.

                              HUNTER
               These have portable generators in
               them.  They're insulated down to here
               -- just be careful not to touch the
               end.

     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal
     object.  A blue spark leaps.

                              FAUST
               Might even incinerate the damn
               thing.

                              STANDARD
                    (sharply)
               I hope not.

                              HUNTER
               Don't worry, it won't damage it,
               it'll just give it a little
               incentive.

                              STANDARD
               How do we locate the creature?

                              FAUST
               With these.

     He picks up a small portable unit.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Tracking device.  You set it to
               search for a moving object... It
               hasn't got much range, but when you
               get within a certain distance, it
               starts beeping.

     Standard takes the device and studies it.

                              STANDARD
               These will be very useful.  At least
               we won't have to go digging around
               in closets with our bare hands.  All
               right, here's the battle plan: we're
               going to break into two teams and
               start systematically covering the
               ship.  Whoever finds it first,
               catches it in the net and ejects it
               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?

                              ROBY
               Even simple.

     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:

                              STANDARD
               For starters, let's make sure the
               bridge is safe.

     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.

                              FAUST
               It's clear.

                              STANDARD
               All right -- Roby and Melkonis will
               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will
               make up the second team.

     They start doling out the equipment.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               We'll all carry communicators.  We
               want to keep in constant touch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,
     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to
     side.

                              FAUST
               Nothing yet... nothing... we can move
               pretty fast as long as there's
               nothing on the tracker.

     INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS

     Standard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a
     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:

                              FAUST
               Hold it.

     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               I've got something.

     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.

                              ROBY
               Where's it coming from?

                              FAUST
                    (peers closely at tracker
                     and frowns)
               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
               Needle's spinning all over the dial.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it malfunctioning?

     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.

                              FAUST
               No, just confused.  It's coming from
               below us.

     They all look down at their feet.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal
     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the
     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.

     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading
     the net across the corridor.

                              ROBY
               Okay.

                              FAUST
                    (looking at tracker and
                     nodding down the passageway)
               That way.

     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw
     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.

                              ROBY
               What happened to the lights?

                              FAUST
               Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to
               replace 'em.

     They switch on the helmet lights.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Hold it.

     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               It's within 4 meters.

     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,
     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of
     approaching the source of the signal.

     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any
     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.

     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one
     wall.

     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets
     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,
     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod
     inside.

     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF
     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.

     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:

                              ROBY
                    (very annoyed)
               Oh, hold it!

     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and
     spitting, it scampers away.

                              MELKONIS
               We're making fools of ourselves!

     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              ROBY
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!
               Get up here fast!

                              ROBY
               Where are you?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Food-storage room!

                              ROBY
               We're coming!

     They dash for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive
     at:

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.

                              HUNTER
               We saw it inside and slammed the
               door on it!  It's in there now!

     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.

                              ROBY
               What's it doing, having a seizure?

                              STANDARD
               It started crashing around right
               after we locked it in.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               I guess we open the door and net it.

                              HUNTER
               I hate to open that door.

     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.

                              STANDARD
               It looks completely different from
               the first one -- it's more like a
               worm with legs... and tentacles.

                              FAUST
               Well we better do something.

                              HUNTER
               Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped
               in there.  We could just leave it in
               there all the way back to Irth.

                              STANDARD
                    (snaps)
               Don't be an idiot.

                              FAUST
               I know what we can do.  We can pump
               poison gas into the room and kill
               it.  Through those ventilator slots
               there.

     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.

                              ROBY
               Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our
               food supplies in there!  We can't
               pump poison gas all over them!

                              STANDARD
               Once we kill the thing we won't need
               the food any more -- we can go
               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it
               sounds like that thing is already
               doing a pretty good job on our
               supplies; it may be fouling them
               all.

                              ROBY
               You win.

                              FAUST
               Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the
               stuff.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER

     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-
     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.
     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large
     metal tank with pressure gauges.

                              STANDARD
               Get those masks on.

     They pull on gas masks.

                              ROBY
               This stuff's deadly -- I hope we
               know what we're doing.

                              STANDARD
               Go ahead, Jay.

     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas
     through the hose and into the room.

     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN
     BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.

     Then the sounds stop altogether.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Shut it off.

     Faust shuts off the pump.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               What do you think?  Now we go in.

     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows
     out.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in
     their gasmasks.

     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered
     all over the floor.

                              FAUST
               Looks like he helped himself.

     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.

     Then Hunter points.

                              HUNTER
               God damn it.

     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL
     HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
               It escaped.

     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.

                              ROBY
               Where does that go?

                              FAUST
               All over the ship; we'll have to
               check the charts to know for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Then let's go and do it.

     They head for the door.

                              HUNTER
               Have we got any food at all left in
               the ship?

     They slam the door shut and seal it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of
     ventilator shafts.

                              FAUST
               That one section of the ventilator
               shaft has only two outlets -- you
               notice?  The food storage room on one
               end --

                              HUNTER
               -- And the cooling unit on the
               other.

                              STANDARD
               So it's trapped in between -- now we
               have to drive it out.

                              FAUST
               Poison gas... 

                              HUNTER
               We can't pump poison gas down into
               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the
               whole ship!

                              STANDARD
               The only other thing I can think of
               is for somebody to crawl in there
               and flush it out.

                              ROBY
               Are you crazy?

                              STANDARD
               The man would need protection,
               obviously -- as well as some way to
               drive the thing before him.

                              FAUST
               How about a flamethrower?  That
               wouldn't poison the air.

                              MELKONIS
               So one of us goes into the airshaft
               and drives the thing along --

                              STANDARD
               While the rest of us wait down in
               the cooling unit with the net.

                              HUNTER
               Sounds like a rough one.

                              STANDARD
               Got a better idea?

     Hunter shrugs.

                              ROBY
               So the only question left is: who
               gets to crawl down the airshaft?

                              STANDARD
               Let's be democratic.

     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one
     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a
     tiny little ball.

     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table
     like dice.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Martin, take one.

     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.

     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.

     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They
     are both blank.

     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open it up, Cleave.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is
     helping him.

     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.

                              FAUST
               Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you
               won't need me, but if you do, I'm
               here.

                              HUNTER
                    (grimly)
               Right.

     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just
     large enough to crawl through.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     It is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his
     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.

                              HUNTER
               Hey, do you guys read me down there?

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum
     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run
     off in different directions.

                              STANDARD
               Yeah, we're getting into position.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Okay, I'm starting now.

     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a
     corner.

     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.

     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE
     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly
     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.

                              ROBY
                    (pointing)
               There.  That's where it's got to come
               out.

     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the
     opening.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               That's a flip-flop gate to channel
               the air, but we can use it to trap
               the thing.

                              STANDARD
               Right now let's keep it closed.

     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The
     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got Hunter... and something else
               as well, in front of him.

                              STANDARD
               Are they close?

                              MELKONIS
               They're on the next level up.

                              STANDARD
               Let's get moving with this net.

     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that
     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.

     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his
     flamethrower.

     Then he starts crawling down, head first.

     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning
     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.

     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.

     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is
     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up
     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.

     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal
     flaming burst toward the sound.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Melkonis is staring at his screen.

                              MELKONIS
               They're getting pretty close now.

                              STANDARD
               All right, then -- when it gets to
               the other side of the door, you sing
               out, then drop the door.  Okay?

                              MELKONIS
               Okay.

                              STANDARD
                    (to Roby)
               And you and I will bag it, and then
               we'll take it to the ventral air
               lock, got it?

                              ROBY
                    (tensely)
               Uh-huh.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the
     flamethrower.

                              HUNTER
                    (whispers)
               Hey, you guys.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
                    (whispering)
               I don't think this shaft goes on too
               much farther... anyway it's getting
               pretty hot in here... 

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Okay, our screens show you as being
               near to the opening.  We'll open it
               up, then we'll cue you and you can
               start blasting.  That'll drive it
               right out.  You don't have to go any
               farther.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Good.

     He readies the flamethrower.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
               Okay, get ready.

     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch
     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric
     prod.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open the vent, Sandy.

     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops
     down, opening up the shaft.

     A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND
     IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN
     OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.

     Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in
     one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN,
     THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK.

     CLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS
     DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING
     AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT.

     Standard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter
     climbs out of the shaft.

                              HUNTER
               What happened?  Where is it?

     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the
     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into
     darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (awed)
               How did it get so big?

                              ROBY
               By eating our food supplies.

                              HUNTER
               Where's Melkonis?

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Faust is still waiting.

                              FAUST
                    (into his communicator)
               Hey, are you guys still there?
               What's going on?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful --
               it's huge now.

                              FAUST
               Right.

     Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks
     the door behind him.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.

                              HUNTER
               You mean his body was still kicking
               when it ran off with him?

                              ROBY
               It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a
               chicken.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows
     shortly.  They all look blank, stunned.

                              FAUST
               What happened?  Where's Sandy?

                              ROBY
               Dead.

                              FAUST
               Dead!

                              ROBY
               It's monstrous -- it grew, like some
               horrible tapeworm.  We were
               completely unprepared.

                              FAUST
               It's still in the ship?

                              STANDARD
               We'd better seal off the lower
               maintenance level; at least trap it
               there.
                    (throws a switch;
                     circuitry lights up)

                              HUNTER
               At least it can't get up here now.

                              ROBY
               Two down, four to go.

                              STANDARD
                    (angrily)
               What's that supposed to mean?

                              ROBY
               Nothing.

                              HUNTER
               Listen, it sure didn't like this
               flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               That's right -- we can't kill it on
               the ship, but we can at least keep
               it at bay -- and maybe drive it into
               the air lock.

                              HUNTER
               Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.

                              FAUST
               There's some more combustible fuel
               down in the storage lockers next to
               the lounge.
                    (rises)
               I'll go get it.

                              STANDARD
               No, I don't want us separated.

                              FAUST
               You just sealed it off; it can't get
               to that section.

                              ROBY
               Don't count on it.

                              HUNTER
               We sure need this flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               All right... but do not go below
               decks.

                              FAUST
               Right.
                    (heads for the door)

                              STANDARD
               And be right back.

	Faust exits.

                              ROBY
               I think it's time we took a hard
               look at those heiroglyphs.

     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics
     appear on some of the screens.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Can you make out any pattern in all
               that?

                              STANDARD
                    (baffled)
               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but
               it's meaningless to me.

                              ROBY
               I know it looks like a senseless
               jumble, but if you look closely,
               there are recognizable forms.

                              HUNTER
               Recognizable!  In that?

                              ROBY
               In symbolic form... very stylized... 
               but if you stare at it, you can see
               some of the different creatures
               we've been dealing with.

                              HUNTER
               Well... I suppose that star-shaped
               thing could be the parasite that got
               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?

                              ROBY
               And right next to it, that oval
               design with the markings -- it's a
               dead ringer for the spore casings.

                              STANDARD
               That next thing there -- six legs,
               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw
               in the food locker.

                              ROBY
               So the next step should be --

                              HUNTER
               -- The big one.  And there it is.

     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible
     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.

                              ROBY
               This is all the same creature.  We're
               seeing the different stages in its
               life-cycle.

                              STANDARD
               Then that tomb... must have been some
               kind of fertility temple... where
               they stored their eggs, and maybe
               held mating rituals... 

                              HUNTER
               ... And Broussard got caught in their
               reproductive cycle.

                              ROBY
               You will notice, though, that there
               are no more phases.  Only four forms
               are shown.  After that the pattern
               repeats.

                              STANDARD
               Which presumably means... 

                              ROBY
               ... More spores coming.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt
     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN
     WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.

     He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE
     DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.

     Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a
     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall
     intercom and speaks into it.

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the lock -- blow the main
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from
     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.

                              STANDARD
                    (into intercom)
               What?

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind
     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature
     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-
     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.

     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,
     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.

     On the wall, a green light goes on:

                         "INNER DOOR CLOSED"

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches
     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.
     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock
     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into
     the vacuum under pressure.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is
     sucked out toward the lock.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:

                         "CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION"

     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control
     room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,
     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along
     by the air current.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds
     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt
     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,
     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.

     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running
     again.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the
     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his
     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound
     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.

     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a
     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch
     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.

     Done in, he collapses to the floor.

     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of
     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --
     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can
     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking
     underwater.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and
     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping
     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses
     bleed.

     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can
     only hear distant croaks.

     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others
     follow him.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM

     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging
     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen
     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.

     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening
     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL
     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the
     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.

     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.

                              ROBY
               How much oxygen did we lose?

     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.

                              STANDARD
               We've got six hours left.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Does anybody know what happened?

                              ROBY
               I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed
               in the air lock door.  His body held
               it open.

                              STANDARD
               Can we get to him?

                              ROBY
               No, I had to seal off a whole
               section.  We'd lose too much of our
               remaining air if we opened the
               connecting door.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the
     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.

     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.

                              ROBY
                    (picking up the cat)
               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.

                              STANDARD
               At least we're rid of the damn
               monster.  It must have been the first
               thing sucked out of the ship.

                              ROBY
               No such luck.  I saw it running down
               one of the corridors.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!
               There's only six hours of air left
               -- we're dead men!

                              STANDARD
               I don't buy that.  There's still time
               to destroy it and get ourselves in
               the freezers.

                              HUNTER
               How?

                              STANDARD
               It's time for drastic remedies.

                              ROBY
               It was time for that a couple days
               ago.

                              STANDARD
               That kind of remark is pointless.
               Now come on -- I want to hear every
               suggestion you can come up with, no
               matter how wild.

                              HUNTER
               We can't kill it on board.  It's huge
               now and must have tremendous amounts
               of that acid in its body.

                              ROBY
               I've got an idea, but you're not
               going to like it.

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
               Okay.  First we shut down all the
               cooling systems on the stardrive
               engines.

                              STANDARD
               That'll blow the ship up.

                              ROBY
               Right... but it'll take a few minutes
               for the engines to overheat and melt
               down the core.  In the meantime, we
               get in the lifeboat and leave the
               ship.

                              HUNTER
               Blow the ship up?

                              ROBY
               And the creature with it.  We can
               make it back to Irth in the
               lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               But the lifeboat can't accelerate to
               light speed.

                              ROBY
               Doesn't matter -- we're already at
               light speed.  And when we get back to
               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in
               the network.

                              HUNTER
               What about all the minerals and
               elements in the cargo hold?  That's
               the only reason we came out here.
               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd
               be broke.

                              ROBY
               Our lives are more important.
               Anyway, we can take a small amount
               of the most valuable stuff with us
               on the lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               No, it won't work and I just
               realized why.  There's only one
               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.
               Only one of us could survive.

                              ROBY
               Yeah... I forgot.

                              STANDARD
               But the idea's good, if we could
               just turn it around somehow.

     They think.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               If we could just get the creature
               into the lifeboat, we could launch
               it into space and blow it up.

                              HUNTER
               Good!  That's good!

                              STANDARD
               We can load the lifeboat up with
               explosives and trigger them
               remotely, once the lifeboat is in
               space.

                              ROBY
               I think it's going to be almost
               impossible to drive it up into the
               lifeboat.

                              HUNTER
               We can use the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               It's not going to work.

                              STANDARD
               You can't say that; I think it's a
               good plan.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower needs more fuel.

                              STANDARD
               Right.  We've got a lot to
               accomplish.  Let's get moving.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.
     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.

     LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS
     SHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.

                              HUNTER
               Which explosive should we use?

                              STANDARD
               I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're
               portable, and they can be radio
               detonated.

     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like
     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.

     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches
     one of them.

                              ROBY
               You know, it's funny -- this stuff
               we went to so much trouble to dig up
               -- this treasure, the paydirt --
               it'll make it back to Irth just fine
               -- even if we're not with it.

                              STANDARD
               Here, carry these.

     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.

                              ROBY
                    (grabbing at him)
               Hey watch it!

                              STANDARD
                    (grinning)
               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop
               it.

     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when
     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.

                              HUNTER
               Hold it!

     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and
     points the tracker around.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
                    (nodding up some steps)
               Up there.

     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks
     up the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               So what do we do?  Do we ignore it
               and finish loading the explosives
               into the boat -- or do we flush it
               out now?

                              STANDARD
               Now.  If we can get it into the boat,
               we won't have to blow it up -- we
               can just eject it into space.

     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.

     INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL

     Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.
     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.

     Then he continues up.

     EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up
     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.

     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS
     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the
     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass
     periodically.

                              STANDARD
                    (shouts)
               You can come up!  It's safe!

     The others come up the steps.

                              ROBY
                    (spying the corpse)
               Oh -- Jesus --

     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn
     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.

                              STANDARD
               The ship's gravitational attraction
               must have drawn him back.

                              HUNTER
                    (horrified)
               Should we go outside and bring him
               in?

                              STANDARD
               No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps
               after we've destroyed the thing.

     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard
     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and
     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This
     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.

     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the
     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an
     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and
     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount
     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               Along the base of the walls there.

     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls
     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.

                              HUNTER
               This should do it.

                              ROBY
               I should hope so!  And we'd better
               make sure it's pretty far from the
               ship when we blow it.

                              STANDARD
               It will be.

                              HUNTER
                    (surveys the craft uneasily)
               What we really need is some red meat
               in here for bait.

                              ROBY
               Well, if we had some, I'd eat it.
               I'm starting to get hungry.

     By this time, they are exiting.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

                              STANDARD
               Well... now we have to herd that
               thing up here.

                              HUNTER
                    (nervously)
               Whoever's doing the herding is gonna
               have their hands pretty full.  I
               think somebody should stay by the
               lifeboat to slam the door on the
               thing once it's inside, and to serve
               as... as... 
                    (searches for a word)

                              ROBY
               Isn't "bait" the word you used?

                              HUNTER
               Hey look, somebody has to have his
               hands free to lock the creature in
               the lifeboat!

                              STANDARD
               Yes, and maybe launch the boat and
               blow it too... if the others are
               injured.

                              ROBY
               Who gets the privilege?

     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.

     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see
     it.  It has a big X on it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device
     like a transistor radio.

                              HUNTER
               Just keep your finger off the button
               till she's way away from the ship,
               that's all.

                              ROBY
               Is it armed?

                              HUNTER
               If you press the button right now,
               it will blow the whole nose of the
               ship off.

                              ROBY
               Thanks for the thought.
                    (puts detonator in his
                     breast pocket)

                              STANDARD
               All right, Martin, we'll be in touch
               with you on the communicator.

                              ROBY
               And you'll let me know when you've
               got it coming this way... 

                              STANDARD
               And you stand aside while we drive
               it in, then shut the hatch, launch
               the boat, and --

                              ROBY
               Kablooey.

     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.

                              STANDARD
               Come on; we haven't much time, air
               is a factor.

     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,
     Hunter the tracker.

     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to
     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat
     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.

     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."

     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got something on the
               tracker... got to be it, it's
               too big for the cat.

     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO
     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               It's coming from down there.

     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,
     breathing, etc.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP

     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at
     the tracker.

                              HUNTER
               It must have stopped moving.  I'm not
               getting anything.

                              STANDARD
               Let me go first; you stay behind me.

     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS
     OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.

     HUNTER SCREAMS.

     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him
     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.

     Standard doesn't know what to do.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower!

                              STANDARD
               I can't, the acid will pour out!

     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN
     MORTAL AGONY.

     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires
     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER
     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.

     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of
     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the
     shrieks and crashing noises.

     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.

                              ROBY
               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?

     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his
     expression that he expects none.

     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has
     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other
     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He
     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.

     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps
     into the maintenance level.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that
     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he
     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.

     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,
     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.

     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the
     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.

     INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM

     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal
     ladder to the floor.

     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,
     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.

     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.

     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from
     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.

     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close
     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF
     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.

     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps
     violently.

                              STANDARD
                    (a feeble whisper)
               Kill me... 

                              ROBY
                    (sickened)
               What did it do to you?

                              STANDARD
                    (moves his head slightly)
               Look... 

     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles
     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller
     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE
     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... 

                              ROBY
                    (looking around for a tool)
               I'll get you out of there.

                              STANDARD
               No... don't... 

                              ROBY
               But I can save you -- get you to the
               Autodoc!

                              STANDARD
               No good... it's eaten too much of
               me... 

                              ROBY
                    (in horror)
               What can I do?

                              STANDARD
               Kill me... 

     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look
     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and
     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and
     scrambles back up the ladder.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.
     At length, he regains control of himself.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED

     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters
     rolling past in the infinite distance.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a
     little oxygen tank on it.

                              ROBY
               Kitty go bye-bye.

     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss
     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in
     front.  It YOWLS.

     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the
     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal
     cannisters.

                              ROBY
                    (reading from labels)
               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how
               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of
               it.  This'll buy us an island on some
               nice planet.

     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries
     back up the steps.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine
     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.

     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the
     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one
     by one.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  The cooling units for the
               stardrive engines are not
               functioning!  Engines will overload
               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!

     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he
     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overheat and
               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30
               seconds!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,
     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.

     INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY

     THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE
     LIFEBOAT.

     It HISSES and starts toward him.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws
     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the
     lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               4 minutes!

     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button.  The thing can
     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.

     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding
     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the
     ship as he sprints for the engine room.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes, 30 seconds!

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of
     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in
     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.

     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit
     switches.

     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes!

     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.

                              ROBY
               Computer!  I've turned all the
               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?

                              COMPUTER
               The reaction has proceeded too far.
               The core has begun to melt.  Engines
               will overload in 2 minutes, 35
               seconds.

     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time
     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               2 minutes!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where
     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward
     the passageway.

     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.

     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.
     Then he advances on the passageway.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the
     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on
     by the siren and the computer:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               90 seconds!

     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his
     head into the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is
     EMPTY.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.
     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               60 seconds!

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and
     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the
     seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.

     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE
     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates
     away from the mother ship.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of
     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly
     circumstances.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the
     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches
     his head down over it.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,
     until it is barely a point of light.

     THEN IT BLOWS UP.

     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL
     DIRECTIONS.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling
     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.

     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of
     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed
     in orange light.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away
     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of
     his ship and friends.

     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN
     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.

     The cat SCREECHES.

     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of
     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.

     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.

     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on
     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any
     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,
     with the door standing open.

     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.

     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker
     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face
     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that
     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is
     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.

     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It
     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.

     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE
     GLASS.

     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the
     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.

     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the
     catbox.

     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull
     it on.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see
     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing
     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it
     into a crevice in the wall.

     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the
     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the
     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.

     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.
     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.

     Again he raps on the glass.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

                              ROBY
               Try a little of this, you fucking
               bastard.

     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT
     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.

     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid
     begins to flow from the wound.

     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a
     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.

     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into
     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel
     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT
     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.
EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing
     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't
     let go.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and
     yanks it.

     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END
     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.

     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,
     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is
     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:

                              "RAM JETS"

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the
     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN
     SHUT OFF.

     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a
     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.

     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --
     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all
     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling
     into infinity.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER

     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He
     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.

                              ROBY
                    (dictating)
               ... So it looks like I'll make it
               back to the Colonies on schedule
               after all.  I should be to the
               frontier in another 250 years or so,
               and then with a little luck the
               network will pick me up.  I'm not as
               rich as I was a couple days ago --
               but I'm not exactly broke either.
               Incidentally, I did manage to
               salvage one souvenir out of this
               whole mess.

     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls
     out the ALIEN SKULL.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Poor Yorick here should go at least
               partway toward proving I'm not a
               crank.  I wish it was him we'd met in
               the first place -- things might have
               turned out different.

     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               This is Martin Roby, executive
               officer, last survivor of the
               commercial vessel SNARK, signing off.
               Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.

     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,
     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.

     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against
     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER
     HIM.

     CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering
     Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth,
     250 years from now.

     As SNARK 2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that A SPORE POD IS
     ADHERED TO THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CRAFT.

     ROLL END TITLES & MUSIC.

comes, Narcissus, since you have no
mother?  Without a mother, one cannot
love.  Without a mother, one cannot die."

			- Hesse





ALIEN III


THE SCREEN IS BLACK

A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

GLASS FURNACE

The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS

Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

GLASS FACTORY

Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

SMOKE

Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

A MAN

On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

MORE MONKS

By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

ONE PARTICULAR MONK

Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

			BROTHER KYLE
	Well would he guess the ascending of the star,
	Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
	He knew the course of every malady,
	Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
	Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

BROTHER JOHN

Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

		       BROTHER KYLE
		Tend you quickly he will,
		with bottles from a shelf.
		But heals not, so easily,
		The ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

		      BROTHER JOHN
		   (to Kyle)
		Enough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

		     BROTHER JOHN
		  (to the burned Monk)
		Relax.
		  (to Kyle)
		Put those lungs of yours to better
		use.

		     BROTHER KYLE
		Yes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

			     JOHN
		Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and don't come
		back to work today --

		     BURNED MONK
		But John --

			     JOHN
		I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
		You're lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace.  If some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

	   	            JOHN
		-- it would've burned clean through to
		the other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
 
		            JOHN
		That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

			BURNED MONK
		Thank you, John.  I --

			   JOHN
		You're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

			  KYLE
		Good work.

			  JOHN
		All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

  			  KYLE
		You're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

INTO THE HALLWAY

The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

			KYLE
		The Abbot will be pleased.

			JOHN
		Don't.

			KYLE
		Don't what?

			JOHN
		Please don't tell him.  At least until
		I know if there's an infection.

			KYLE
		You want to be the Abbey's Physician,
		and you haven't learned the first rule:
		Don't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

			KYLE
		I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
		how you must --

			JOHN
		You don't, but thanks anyway.

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

			KYLE
		Not coming down?

			JOHN
		I have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

THE STAIRWAY

A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

ONE FLOOR UP

A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM

An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

			JOHN
		Come on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

INT. LIBRARY

A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP

In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY

John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

			PHILIP
		Brother John.

			JOHN
		Brother Philip.

			PHILIP
		Feeding the mind instead of the body
		again?

			JOHN
		My training has taught me to feed what's
		hungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

			PHILIP
		As did mine.  As long as you're alone.
		Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
		leaves the library.

			JOHN
		How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

			JOHN
		Perfect.

They move into the library...

THE MEDIEVAL SECTION

The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

AT THE SHELVES

John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

			John
	    	    (reading)
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

			VOICE O/S
		Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

THE ABBOT

Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

			John
		Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

			ABBOT
		Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
		him on the way up.  He said you'd come 
		in alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

			ABBOT
		Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

			ABBOT
		You know what Philip says about Mattias'
		hair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
		take him out of here.

			JOHN
		He likes when I read to him and -- I 
		can't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

			ABBOT
		    (smiles)
		Someone must have left this one unlocked.
		Take the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

			JOHN
		Father, I --?

			ABBOT
		Kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today.

			JOHN
		I'll reserve judgement until the patient
		lives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

			ABBOT
		It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
		an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

			ABBOT
		Just have it back before the end of lunch.
		Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

			JOHN
		Thank you.
		      (to Mattias)
		Let's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

INTO THE BELL TOWER

The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT

The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

JOHN

Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV

Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

			JOHN
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
		by day, one by one, until I am the only 
		one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
		it, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

			JOHN
		- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence - this Black Death - 
		stay my hand.
			(beat)
		This was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

ONE OF THE STARS

Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

THE STAR

Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

JOHN

Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

THE STAR

Brighter still.  Closer.

MORE MONKS

Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

			RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
			-----------------------
			POPULATION: 350 Exiles
			CRIME:  Political Heresy

THE STAR

Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON

Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

INTO THE SEA

WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

JOHN

Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

ON THE SEA - DAWN

The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

THE STAR

Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

JOHN

Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

NEXT TO THE HATCH

A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
WUORRRSH -!
Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

			KYLE O/S
		Watch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

THE OTHER MONKS

Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

			KYLE
		John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

WHOOSH-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY

Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE

A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

			COMPUTER VOICE
			(sotto)
		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

IN THE TUBE

There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

THE FLOOR

Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

JOHN

Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

LIGHTS

Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN

LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
He moves on...

A VIDEO MONITOR

Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

			WOMAN
		...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
		Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
		Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
		hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
		Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
		and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

HSSSSSSSSS -!
A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!

Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

A WOMAN

The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

THE DOOR

Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

			KYLE
		John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

			JOHN
		No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
		in here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

			SECOND MONK
		This is forbidden.

			KYLE
		John.  Just get the hell out of there --

			JOHN
		I don't want to stay.  I have to get her
		out before this sinks.  You come in, give
		me a hand --

			KYLE
		Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
		so this is technology forbidden to us.
		Get out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

			JOHN
		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY

Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

			FIRST MONK
		     (reverent)
		A space ship...

			SECOND MONK
                    (even more reverent)
		A woman...

			KYLE
		You shouldn't have gone in --

			JOHN
		I'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

			JOHN
		She could've been lost.

			FIRST MONK
		Been a long time since I saw either.

			SECOND MONK
		It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
		supposed to do with it?

			KYLE
		What was it like in there --?

			JOHN
		Lights.  So many lights --

			THIRD MONK
		Tow it in.  Bring it in.

			SECOND MONK
		It's evil.

			FIRST MONK
		It's just technology.

			SECOND MONK
		Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know what we should do
		with it --

			KYLE
		Just lights?

			JOHN
		Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

			SECOND MONK
		See?  Just look at the fish.

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know.

			SECOND MONK
		They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

			JOHN
		Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.
		Like Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

JOHN

He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

RIPLEY

Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV

Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

RIPLEY

Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

			RIPLEY
		Wait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

						GO TO BLACK...

INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK

The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

JOHN

Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

THE ALIEN

Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

			RIPLEY
		AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!

Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

			JOHN
		You're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY

A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

			ABBOT
		How is the woman, John?

			JOHN
		I don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

			JOHN
		She is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

HER POV

Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING

With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

			RIPLEY
		What the hell --?

SUDDENLY --
The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

			RIPLEY
		This must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

RIPLEY

Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you?

			ABBOT
		I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
		And you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

			RIPLEY
		Ripley.  How did I get here?

			ABBOT
		Your vehicle crash landed.
		     (indicates John)
		Brother John found you and brought
		you here.

			RIPLEY
		Where is here?

			ABBOT
		This is the Minorite Abbey within the
		manmade orbiter Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Can I use a radio to --
	
			ABBOT
		We have no radio here.  We are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology.  We live the old way.  The pure
		way.

She shakes her head.

			RIPLEY
		Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full D-F program...
		Where's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

			RIPLEY
		There was a little girl with me --

			ABBOT
		You were alone.

			RIPLEY
		No.  She was with me.  I put her in her
		stasis tube -- We launched when the --

			ABBOT
		You were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

			RIPLEY
		     (slowly)
		Oh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

			RIPLEY	
		It came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

			ABBOT
		What came with you?

			RIPLEY
		Listen -- there is a danger here.  It
		came with me.  How long have I been here?

			ABBOT
		Almost two days --

			RIPLEY
		     (calculates)
		Loose for two days.  This planet could be
		overrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

			RIPLEY
		Look, there's a xenomorph --
		    (sees his confusion)
		An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
		And now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
	
			RIPLEY
		Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
		platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
		to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
		months ago - maybe a year --

			ABBOT
		     (interrupts)
		Wait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

			ABBOT
		Leave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

			ABBOT
		Continue.

			RIPLEY
		We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
		Gateway sub-orbital space station --

			ABBOT
		Not possible.

			RIPLEY
		What do you mean?

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
	
			RIPLEY
		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
		many people do you have here?  Let's worry
		about them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

			ABBOT
		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest
		some more.

			RIPLEY
		I don't need rest - I need to get to 
		your people.  You've got to get to them --
		tell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

			ABBOT
		I have had enough for now.

			RIPLEY
		Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
		It could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet.  It may have started 
		already - Have there been any unusual 
		deaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

			ABBOT
		No.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

			ABBOT
		Bolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

			JOHN
		What is it -- What's wrong?

			ABBOT
		Your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state.  Nobody gets in or out until I
		say so.

			JOHN
		But I.  Her meals --

			ABBOT
		Nobody.

			JOHN
		Father, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
WHAM!
The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
		said you'd -- I need -- you're the
		medic --

			JOHN
		What?!

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		My Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

			JOHN
		Huh?  A woman?

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Sandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

			JOHN
		One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
		Call a vet.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Father Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

			JOHN
		You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
		All creatures great and small...

INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		I just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over.

			JOHN
		So would I.  It's freezing in here.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin.

			JOHN
		Haven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak "Baa-ah."

			JOHN
		May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
		around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

			JOHN
		First, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE

			JOHN
		Wait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What is it?

			JOHN
		I don't know.  It's all over the ground.
		Some sort of --

BAAA-AAAH!!!
The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What?!  WHAT?!

			JOHN
		Jesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
THE EWE EXPLODES ---!

Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER

BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.

The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of
his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic
and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --
The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --

The CREATURE

WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is
roughly TORN from it's nesting place --
The Monk lifts --

It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.

The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --
The entire corner of the barn is ablaze --
SHOVES the abomination in --

The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --

The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on --

JOHN

Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from
his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil.

EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...

We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts.
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt --

			RIPLEY
		Idiots...I'll --

WHAM!
The door BURSTS OPEN --

			RIPLEY
		What the -?

Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her.
TEAR her out of bed --

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway.

			ABBOT V.O.
		An evil has come to Arceon...

IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT

As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending
at the Abbots...

			ABBOT
		You heard Brother Graham tell of the
		devil inside sheep's wool --

He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.

			ABBOT
		An evil brought by this woman in her
		vessel of technology.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

RIPLEY

Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

			RIPLEY
		This can't be happening.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		You have no voice in this tribunal.

			RIPLEY
		You must listen to me!  You're all in
		terrible danger!  It came with me on
		the ship --

			ABBOT
		We know that.  At first we believed its
		arrival was a good omen.  But it has only
		brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Evil.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

			RIPLEY
		Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
		brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

			ABBOT
		We know the name of the evil it brought.
		It brought technology.  Technology to
		destroy our planet, as surely as it
		destroyed the Earth.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		Destruction!

			RIPLEY
		I was on the Earth less than a year ago.
		It's still there.  People, cities, all 
		still there!

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

			ABBOT
		    (matter of fact)
		All dead.

			RIPLEY
		    (screams)
		It's still there!

The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack.
He stands and begins to pace.

			ABBOT
		You could not have been on the Earth a
		year ago, because there is no Earth to
		be on -- for at least twenty years.

			RIPLEY
		I haven't been floating in space for
		twenty years.  Let me get to my ship
		and I'll prove it.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		No.  Who knows what new evils she'll
		release if allowed back into that
		infernal machine.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		No!  Don't let her!!

			TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		This woman is a danger.  She denies The
		New Dark Age.  She denies reality.

			RIPLEY
		This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph
		loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must
		have stowed away on my ship -- must have
		killed --
			(swallows hard)
		Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me.
		You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like
		an egg - grows -
			(mimes)
		Explodes out of you - keeps growing into
		some sort of monster.  Kills you --
		Kills all of you...

She looks at the Medieval people around her.
They stare at her in complete confusion.
To them, she does sound like a madwoman.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you people?  Look at you -- all
		of you -- the way you're dressed.  This
		isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --
		on a artifical planet.  What are you
		doing out here?

There, in the upper tier -- John.  They make eye contact. 
She looks to him pleadingly.

			RIPLEY
		Isn't there anyone here who will
		listen?

John looks from Ripley to the Abbot.
The Abbot stares him down.
John turns away.

			RIPLEY
		    (defeated)
		I guess not.  I can't believe this...

The gavel BANGS.
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.

			ABBOT
		Then there is no choice.

The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly --
Bind her arms.

			ABBOT
		   (to Ripley)
		The evil is inside you.  I cast you down.
		To be sealed away.  And God have mercy on
		your soul.

						SLAM CUT TO:

THE SHAFT ROOM - DAY

A Medieval elevator shaft.  The "elevator" is a wooden cage
lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes.
Ripley, bound, is led to it.

She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --

			RIPLEY
		You won't be able to fight it...
		You don't know what it is --!

She's put into the cage.  The door is secured.
Two monks begins to pull the ropes.  The cage is lifted out over
the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space.

The other Monks move closer.  Crowd around the edge --
John pushes through them - right to the edge --
Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...

Ripley looks directly at John --

			RIPLEY
		You've sentenced yourselves to 
		death!

John watches as she disappears down into the darkness...
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --
Down the hall --

THE TRIBUNAL ROOM

Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members.
They speak in hushed tones.
John appears in the doorway, but pauses -
strains to hear what they are saying:

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		...they'll have started before she gets
		down to the Hermitage level.

			ABBOT
		No trouble?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Only finding the wood for the ship.  But
		Anderson's hut was about that big, and
		he's dead three months now.

			ABBOT
		I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister 
		next winter.  Well, we might not get to
		the winter if we don't take care of this.
		By winter time we can start taking the 
		penitent cells apart.  No one in them.

			ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
		The wood isn't going to last forever.

			ABBOT
		Neither are we --

He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other
Tribunal members out of the room.  John moves to the Abbot.
The Abbot knows what's coming...

			ABBOT
		Go ahead.

			JOHN
		This woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

			ABBOT
		Yes, and you did a good job.  You
		shouldn't feel responsible.  You
		couldn't have known --

			JOHN
		Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that
		there may be something to what she says.

			ABBOT
		There isn't.

The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel,
notebook.  John follows him --

			JOHN
		I don't understand what you are doing.

			ABBOT
		This colony is my responsibility.  I am
		protecting the colony.

			JOHN
		From what?  This woman?  You never gave
		her a chance.  How can you be so sure
		you're right?

			ABBOT
		A better question is what makes you
		think I'm wrong?

			JOHN
		You didn't see this thing -- this demon --
		Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

			ABBOT
		      (realizes)
		That's right.  You both did.
		      (beat)
		And what was it?

			JOHN
		I -- I don't know what it was.  But I
		don't think Ripley was a party to it.

			ABBOT
		She admits she brought it.

			JOHN
		But she tried to warn us --

			ABBOT
		You know that's how the devil works.
		Deception.

			JOHN
		But I believe her.  I don't know how to
		describe it -- A feeling.

			ABBOT
		You haven't seen a woman in thirty years.
		Where does this feeling originate, John?

			JOHN
		     (points to his head)
		Here.

Pause.

			ABBOT
		I believe you.  But your feelings are
		fooling you.  

			JOHN
		It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

The Abbot snaps at him --

			ABBOT
		Don't think.

John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never
heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.
Forces a smile.

			ABBOT
		It's been a long night.  For all of us.
		You really don't understand what you're
		dealing with here.

			JOHN
		That's what she said.

The Abbot chafes.

			ABBOT
		These are ideas which threaten the very
		system we live under.  The creature is
		dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.
		Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,
		but leave this alone.

			JOHN
		But I --

			ABBOT
		Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias
		into the Library, all right?  For your
		own good, just stay out of this.

John looks like he's going to protest.

			ABBOT
		I mean it.

			JOHN
		     (slowly)
		Yes, Father.

John turns and leaves the room.  
The Abbot stares after him.


INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark. Dank. Dreary.
A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.
The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.

Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -
HAMMERED in tight.


TWO ANCIENT WORKERS

Drab, torn gray clothing.
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall.
Methodically covering up --

RIPLEY

Watching them work.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Defeated.


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)

A dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco
escape ship - A frame of wood --
begin to wall it in...


IN THE PRISON LEVEL

The two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry.
The planks cover more of the opening.
BAM-BAM-BAM.

Covers more of Ripley.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
She stares...


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Planks are rising around the ship.
Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.

IN THE LIBRARY

John and Mattias sit before an open book.
He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.
It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.
Through his SKULL.
He closes his eyes in pain.

RIPLEY

Only her face is visible.
Another board.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Then just her eyes.

Just before the last plank is put in place --

			WORKER
		Here you go, woman.  Something from your
		ship.  Something to keep you company --

He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.
Watches as the last of the light is covered over.
BAM-BAM...BAM.

She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught --

NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.

Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind
other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie. 
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand.
A beat.

She FREAKS OUT --!

			RIPLEY
		You fucking idiots!  You're dead!
		You're all dead!

BEATS the walls.  KICKS.
SMASHES her HEAD against the wall.
Again.
Her nose starts to bleed.
Her hand goes to her nose.
She squints in the darkenss.
Sees the BLOOD.
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth.
Death is with her again.

			RIPLEY
		     (sotto)
		Dead...

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide
down into a sitting position.  She does.

			RIPLEY
		Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.
		Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

Looks at the Doll's head --

			RIPLEY
		Newt.  This isn't what I wanted...

She throws the doll's head away --
It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her.

			RIPLEY
		     (snaps)
		Don't stare at me!

Beat.

			VOICE O/S
		Sorry.

Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her --
Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers:
A HOLE.  In it:

A MAN'S FACE

Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.
He's looking back at her.


ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT

The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have
finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.

As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --
Pass them -- down to an open window and into...


INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN

John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.
The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of
books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.
All open to --

PICTURES OF DEVILS

Different representations of Evil through the ages --
Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss
Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from
"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry."

The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony."
Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil."
A miasma of Medieval Monsters.


JOHN

Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book.

The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval
tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted
as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.
This is it.

We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:

His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the
image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say
something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.

John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!
The old chain gives way.

Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes...


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY

John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's 
office opens suddenly --

BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other
direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the
doorway with the Abbot.

			JOHN
		Now find John and have him brought to 
		me immediately.

			THIRD BURLY MONK
		Yes, Father.

			ABBOT
		Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. 

The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and
closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY

The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.
Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other Monks begin to stoke the fire.

John enters.
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --


KYLE

At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the 
MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.
Almost knocks him over --

			KYLE
		Hey!  Watch it!

He sees that John is agitated --

			KYLE
		What?  What is it?

The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in
for a look...

			JOHN
		I -- Abbot.  Must --

John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly.
Kyle puts down his blowing iron.

			KYLE
		John - relax.  Take a deep breath -
		Christ, now I sound like you --

He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.

			KYLE
		Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?

			JOHN
		     (panting)
		Yes.  Devil.

Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.
John sees the other monks gathering around --
Closing in on him - whispering --

			WHISPERING MONKS
		He's got it...

			SECOND WHISPERING MONK
		Like the Comet Woman...

			THIRD WHISPERING MONK
		He found her...
		
			WHISPERING MONK
		He's infected...

John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell
the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear.

			KYLE
		Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's
		see the --

			JOHN
		Don't humor me -- I'm --
	
			KYLE
		Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

If only he could explain - he can't.
John YANKS the book away -- spins --
Bursts through the crowd...

			KYLE
		Wait -- JOHN!


INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY

The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.
John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  
The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.
He PULLS --

There's no tension against the ropes.
John FALLS back on his ass.

The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.
Pile on the floor in front of John. 
He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares:
BITTEN THROUGH.

							CUT TO:

THROUGH THE MONASTERY - SERIES OF SHOTS

John RUNS through the building.
Through the upper half of the planet.
DOWN through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to
the previous night's events and the danger they face:

Monks working at Looms.
Monks in the Tanning Room.
Monks in Morning Prayer.
Past them all, to --


INT. ABBEY BASEMENT WORKROOM - DAY

Mops and brooms.
John enters.  His hair is wild, breathing heavy.
He shoves the book into his medical bag.
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
WOODEN DOOR set into the timbers of the floor.
He opens the door:


LADDERS

Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet - below that, the cells.
And Ripley.


JOHN

Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.
He MUST go down -- The hard way.
He climbs into the darkness...


INT. ABBEY LAVATORY - NIGHT

An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet STALLS facing a hundred wall
mounted SINKS.  Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful
truth -
The stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still
functional - A facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left.

A SKINNY MONK washes his hands.


IN THE STALLS

Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to
last being The Abbot --

			ABBOT
		Cold tonight --

-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Gets colder every night.

			ABBOT
		And every day.  Never this bad.  Taken
		so much wood out of the structure the
		surface wind blows right through the
		colony.  Right under the floor --

The Bald Tribunal Member SHIVERS as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl. 

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Right up your bloody backside.  Nights
		like this make me miss plumbing -- 
		Ack --!

He feels a TUGGING at his bowels - it's not piles. 
A beat.

			ABBOT O/S
		What?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		I don't -- AAH --

The Bald Tribunal Monk SCREAMS as something GRABS him from
below --

(note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off.
I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)

Something SNAKES up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
He convulses in spasms of agony.

There is a terrible RIPPING SOUND as the Bald Tribunal Monk is 
PULLED VIOLENTLY down -- out of frame --

We PAN BACK down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk
and see their HORRIFIED REACTION as they feel the ALIEN drag the
Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them...

THE ABBOT in his stall

He pounds on the wall --

			ABBOT
		Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

SKINNY MONK washing his hands, sees all this.  Looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet --


OTHER MONKS

In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey
into an abattoir.

							CUT TO:
SPACE

Angle on the Orbitor Arceon:

An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial
seas.

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Death...


INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGHT

Darkness.  Somewhere water drips into a puddle.
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor.  Her eyes are closed.

			RIPLEY
		Wherever I go.

A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. 
She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's
head appears --

			WHITE-HAIRED MAN
		Take it.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

She knows his name.

			ANTHONY
		You waiting for meat?  They don't bring
		me meat because they know I'm an android.
		Really don't need it.  Bread's better
		for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so 
		it makes you feel fuller than you are.

			RIPLEY
		Not hungry.

Anthony takes a bite.

			ANTHONY
		Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the
ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		Waste of time.

			ANTHONY
		You don't eat, you'll starve to death,
		girl.

			RIPLEY
		That was the plan when they put me down
		here.  And why should you care?

			ANTHONY
		Because I'm a synthetic person you don't
		think I can care?

			RIPLEY
		Believe me, that's a discussion you don't
		want to have with me.

			ANTHONY
		You told me you had a bad experience and
		a good one with androids --

			RIPLEY
		That's one of each.  That means you could
		go either way.  I'm tired of talking about
		this.

He pushes the bread towards her again.

			ANTHONY
		You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight
		the bastards --

			RIPLEY
		I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be
		dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't
		get the satisfaction.

			ANTHONY
		He?  You make it sound like this Alien
		has a personal score to settle with you.
		The biology you describe:  Queen laying
		eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very
		insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear
		grudges.

			RIPLEY
		And Androids usually aren't the prisoners
		of lunatics that believe they're ancient 
		Greeks.

			ANTHONY
		Medieval Monks.

			RIPLEY
		Whatever.	

			ANTHONY
		And they've only chose to live the life
		style, they don't believe they're --
		     (hears something)
		What's that?

Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance:
KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls.
A VOICE calls out --


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

			JOHN
		     (hoarse)
		Ripley!

He moves down the hallway.
BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet --
Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on.


INT. ANTHONY'S CELL

Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell:

The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches -
Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes -
This guy is an Android!

Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level.


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV

John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

			ANTHONY
		Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out --
		You're going to wake everybody up.

John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot.
Anthony recognizes him.

			ANTHONY
		Brother John?

John unbolts Anthony's door.
Picks him up by his cassock --

			JOHN
		Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

			ANTHONY
		Made too good for that.  What're
		you doing?

			JOHN
		I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

			ANTHONY
		What?  You look like you've seen the
		devil.

			RIPLEY O/S
		He has.

Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can 
see her face at the hole --

			ANTHONY 
		You mean he --

Anthony turns back - John is gone.

INT. THE CORRIDOR

As John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.

			RIPLEY
		I was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,
		you've seen the Alien?

John pauses at that.  
His eyes tighten at the memory.

			RIPLEY
		I can tell you have.  I was right.
		It came with me.
			(to the wall, sharp)
		Go away.

John stops.  Looks at the wall.
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...

			RIPLEY
		Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I
		know what you want.  I can't help you.
		I couldn't help any of the others.  
		Just stop what you're doing.  Go away.
		Do you understand?

John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes.  
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply --
He goes back to work as she continues her confession...

			RIPLEY
		You going to stay, Father?  But you're 
		not going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can
		listen.  You should listen.  Your Abbot
		was right.  I am guilty.  But not of 
		heresy.  Of murder.

John stops again.
Just stares at her eyes.

			RIPLEY
		The murder of the crew of the Nostromo.
		That was when I first met the Alien.

That reminds him of why he's here.
He doubles his efforts at the boards...

			RIPLEY
		No, not the same one that's here now.
		Or maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the 
		same one.  I couldn't save my crew then.
		I should have been able to.  But I couldn't.
		When I went the second time --

Her eyes soften.

			RIPLEY
		Then I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --
		stayed alive to keep Newt alive.
		Hoped maybe that would make up for...

She trails off.  Slides down the wall.

			RIPLEY
		Now he got her too.  What's the point?
		     (hard again)
		Just go away.  Leave me in here.  If you
		let me out you'll want me to help you
		and it will start all over again.
		Let it end.

John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him.  Ripley looks up at him.

			RIPLEY
		I can't help you.

John, heaving and panting from the excertion.
Swallows...

			JOHN
		Puh. (pant) Please.

			RIPLEY
		It never ends.


INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

A long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet.  There is MOVEMENT at the far end.  Something is
coming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and 
shadow --

			RIPLEY O/S
		Sheep?

RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHONY

Running together.  Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear.  John has his bag.  Ripley a torch. 
We move with them.

			ANTHONY
		It must be able to take on some of the
		characteristics of the animal it grows in.
		Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive
		soldier race -- warring parties drop the
		eggs on opposing planets --

			RIPLEY
		And the alien takes on the form of the
		creature that finds it, assuming that
		animal is the dominant life form on the
		planet.  So when it gestates in a man --

Ripley shudders at the memory.

			ANTHONY
		It's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.  I just didn't think it could do that
		to animals.

			JOHN
		Wait a minute - I thought you were the
		expert on this monster.

			RIPLEY
		Is that the only reason you came to get
		me out?  Because I knew about this thing?

			JOHN
		Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of
		it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.
		I was wrong not to say anything.  I was
		afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a 
		monk, you know?

Ripley stops.  Looks at him.
A long beat.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you.  If anything, you're honest.

			JOHN
		We all are.  Took vows.

			RIPLEY
		I don't know about the Abbot.

			JOHN
		I'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

			RIPLEY
		Is that speaking up for someone?

			JOHN
		No.  Charity.

She smiles.  They turn a corner...


INT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find 
themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

			RIPLEY
		All right, let's forget about the past
		and get on to our survival.  No more
		prisoners behind us?

			ANTHONY
		Not for years.

			RIPLEY
		Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days
		to lay his eggs our only hope is to get
		off this - What is this?

			JOHN
		Arceon.

			ANTHONY
		Satellite.

			RIPLEY
		Get to my ship and get off this Satellite.

			JOHN
		We can't.

			RIPLEY
		We can't what?

			JOHN
		Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

			RIPLEY
		A Tape Library?

			JOHN
		Books.

			RIPLEY
		So?

			JOHN
		The reason we are out here.  Like the
		Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries 
		on remote islands off England during
		the First Plague --

			RIPLEY
		There must be books on other colonies --

			JOHN
		Some of these books survived the burning
		of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They
		contain knowledge that exists in no 
		other record.  Their value is unestimable.

He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.

			JOHN
		We're supposed to protect them.

			RIPLEY
		    (to Anthony)
		And what does an android have to do 
		with all this?

			JOHN
		He's a spy.

			ANTHONY
		The Company planted me here.

			RIPLEY
		The Company?  What does the Company have
		to do with this?

			ANTHONY
		They built this prison.

			RIPLEY
		Prison?

			JOHN
		Colony.

			ANTHONY
		Prison.  They are all political heretics.  

Ripley looks at John.

			RIPLEY
		You left that part out.

			JOHN
		The order was more of a counter culture,
		a reaction to the Technology that was
		beginning to take over everyone's lives.
		It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
		watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
		into the air.  The earliest members
		renounced technology.  Started to collect
		the remaining books.  Nobody would have
		noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

			RIPLEY
		Your Abbot talked about that.  The
		New Plague.

			ANTHONY
		A computer virus.  A bad program.  By
		this time the Corporate structure was
		transglobal, all the world's data storage
		systems were linked.  It spread through
		two countries before it was stopped.

			JOHN
		After a scare like that, thousands flocked
		to our retreat.  People started clamoring
		for written information.  For our books.
		They abandoned the modern ways --

			RIPLEY
		I think I can see how this comes out.	
		They gave up their possessions.

			ANTHONY
		This was a threat --

			RIPLEY
		To the Company.

			JOHN
		They sold the technology.  A movement 
		to live simply was quickly twisted by 
		Federal agents into a political movement
		against the Company-controlled World
		Government.  Too much was at stake.

			RIPLEY
		Too much profit.

			JOHN
		We were sentenced as political dissidents.
		This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men
		were packed up with all our books, and
		towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The
		eldest died very quickly.

			RIPLEY
		The Company had such a sense of irony.  
		Sending you out on this wooden tub.

			ANTHONY
		I was placed among them as a sensor.
		Keeps tabs on the movement.

			RIPLEY
		So how'd they find out about you?

			ANTHONY
		I told them.  After the supply ship's
		stopped coming I saw no point in keeping
		up the charade.  Since I was a sort of
		walking reminder of technology, they cast
		me down.

			RIPLEY
		Join the club.
		     (to John)
		I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't
		have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be
		prudent to try to preserve man's written
		works for generations -- without women.

John looks embarrassed.

			RIPLEY
		And I don't know about your New Plague,
		but I was just on Earth and everything's 
		fine.

John has a doubtful look.

			RIPLEY
		I was right about the Alien, wasn't I?
		Means I must be right about the Earth.

The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.

			JOHN
		     (beat)
		Perhaps.

			RIPLEY
		That's better than nothing.  Come on.

They reach the end of the corridor.
It opens into --


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL

An enormous open space between "cell blocks."
The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings
going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden.

The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
-- falling off into gloom.

They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them.  Finally --


			RIPLEY
		At any rate, let's forget about the
		Earth completely - whether you're right
		or I'm right what's important is getting
		the hell out of here.  From here my ship
		is...?

John points up at the ceiling.

			ANTHONY
		In Heaven.

			RIPLEY
		Right.  And this is...

Anthony and John nod.

			ANTHONY
		This orbiter was patterned after a 
		medieval concept of the universe --
			 (makes a circle in the air)
		They call the top half "Heaven - "

			JOHN
		The Abbey, the fields --

			ANTHONY
		The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

			RIPLEY
		Aptly named.  What's in the middle?

			JOHN
		The sea.

			ANTHONY
		Really.

			RIPLEY
		Work with me here.  How far is it back
		to the surface of the planet?

			JOHN
		As a stone falls --- Five miles through
		the center.

			RIPLEY
		And the elevator -- the thing they
		lowered me down in?

			JOHN	
		Ropes cut.

			ANTHONY
		It's smart.  First he cuts their escape
		off, then works his way down through the 
		monastery level by level until there
		isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

			RIPLEY
		Well, you start appreciating him more
		than me and I'll find a way to shut
		you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we
		get up?

			JOHN
		There are ladders.

She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her.

			RIPLEY
		Five miles with the Alien between us
		and there?  Good luck, boys.

She turns and heads back towards her cell --
John catches her shoulder --

			JOHN
		You can't --

			RIPLEY
		Can't what?  Not help you go to your
		deaths?  I've had my fill of that.

			JOHN
		I need you.  I can't do it alone.

			RIPLEY
		I've fought these creatures twice
		before.  It take a lot to kill
		these things.  Heavy artillery.

			ANTHONY
		We don't have weapons here.

			RIPLEY
		How about something we can make weapons
		from?  Do you have anything like that --
		any modern things here?

John SHAKES his head vehemently --

			JOHN
		We renounced technology.  It was those
		things that caused the Plague.

			RIPLEY
		This is a man-made planet.  Something has
		to be recirculating your air, your water.

			JOHN
		God?

			RIPLEY
		Please.

			JOHN
		I don't know.  I just took it for granted.

			RIPLEY
		Most people do.  Without some sort of
		technology we haven't got a chance.

From behind them:

			ANTHONY
		There is technology.

John and Ripley turn to look at him.

			ANTHONY
		A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air
		and water come out.

			RIPLEY
		An atmosphere processing plant --

			ANTHONY
		The heart and lungs of Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Where is it?

			ANTHONY
		One level beneath the underground sea.

			JOHN
		That's five levels up --

			ANTHONY
		     (points into the gloom)
		On the other side of the orbiter.

John looks at Ripley --

			JOHN
		A chance.

Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  You've got me - so far.
		But here's the deal:  I don't know
		how many of your brethren are going
		to be alive when we get up there,
		but if we make it to my ship, you're
		all coming with me.  We'll take as
		many of your precious books as we
		can carry, but we're going.  I'm not
		going to fight this thing again to 
		end up alone again.  Understand?

John nods his head.

			RIPLEY
		We're all dead anyway.  We might as
		well go fi --

She feels a TWINGE in her midsection --
Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm --

			RIPLEY
		Ugh - I'm all right.

She takes a deep breath.

			RIPLEY
		Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...
		Come on.

							CUT TO:


INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT

The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield.  Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke.

DOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,
in the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,
whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts
into rough barricades.

A "Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden "ground."  More ladders.
They climb down to --


AN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an 
Underground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for
miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the Abbey fifty feet above --

THE CEILING

A lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --
the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery.


THE MONKS

Descend the ladders single file.  Fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories.  They move cautiously
into the wheat.  Spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line.


THE ABBOT

The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,
stands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he
watches


THE MONKS IN THE FIELD

THRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass.  Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field.

			ABBOT
		     (sotto)
		Stay together.  Together...

Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye --
AHEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind.
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens.
a TRAIL forms.
SomeTHING is MOVING in the long grass.
Moving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST.

The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even
though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap -
Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

AARGH-Aa -!
The Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass.  His taper falls
among the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE...

The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can.  He finds his voice:

			ABBOT
		Run!  RUN!

The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk
screamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the now
moving again trail --

			ABBOT
		No - NO.  The --

The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle --
RAKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat.
His tail, arms WHIP out --
SNAP their spines like kindling.
Lost torches ignite the wheat...

The field BURSTS INTO FLAME.
Smoke fills the air.

In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running.
Weapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly --
Screaming.  Crying.  DYING.

One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest.

And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere.
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it SLASHES and TEARS its way
across the field --


THE ABBOT

Frozen in terror to the spot.   Squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat
rising up from the wounded.

The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --

He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.
He climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up.  He slowly turns...

THE ALIEN

Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.

It is golden.
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now
grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.

The Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.


			JOHN O/S
		It isn't your fault, you know.


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS

They move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead.
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards.
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling.

			RIPLEY
		What?

			JOHN
		Those things you said before --

Ripley remembers her "confession."

			JOHN
		I read about it in psychology books.
		Sometimes when people outlive someone
		they cared for, they transfer some of
		the guilt for that person's death to
		themselves.

			RIPLEY
		I got a belly full of that from the
		Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.
		"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
		like that.  But that's not what I was
		thinking about.  I was thinking about
		my "friend" up there.

She looks up.

			RIPLEY
		He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but
		not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like
		he's playing with me.  Maybe they have
		some sort of race memory.  Maybe he
		knows what I did to his "mother."
		That's why he didn't just kill me.
		That would be too easy.  He has to
		torment me.

			JOHN
		You make it sound human.

			RIPLEY
		Hell, I don't know what it is.

John unconsiously fingers his book.

			JOHN
		I think I do.


INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up.
Years of damp air have warped the ladder.
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand.
They climb...


INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark.  Ripley is the first one up.
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone.
The cells here have no doors.
She holds her torch in one --
An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.


AT THE LADDER

John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him.  
Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand.
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without
them, then reaches down to help Anthony.
Their hands clasp --


ANTHONY HAS A "VISION"

He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing
peacefully at his side.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.

Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons.
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs.
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE --

Anthony SCREAMS -!


RIPLEY

Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony
fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp -


ANTHONY

Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind --
He JERKS --
Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP --
OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him...


JOHN

Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand.
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft --

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

He PULLS with all his might...


ANTHONY

SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak --
BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air --
He aims for its head:
CRACK -!
WHACKS John's hand with his staff --

John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO --

Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air --

Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT --
GRAB Anthony's cassock --
STOP his fall.

Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror --
A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched
itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Ripley has become the Alien.

WHACK!
Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff --
HITS Ripley on the head.
WHACK!
Again.  In the face.

John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm --
WHACK!
The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back.
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock --
Opens her mouth - GRUNTS --

ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him.

WHACK! 
His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose.
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance --
Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony --

JOHN GRABS THEM!

Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them
into the corridor -- WHUMPH!

They land on the floor in a heap.
Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT --

Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them.
Finally, the vision leaves him.
He loses consciousness.


JOHN

Breathing heavy - opens his eyes --
He's staring right into Ripley's face.
Less than an inch away.
He's laying on top of her.
She's breathing heavy too.
A long, uncomfortable moment.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks.

			JOHN
		You're welcome.

They roll off each other.
Her hand goes up to her nose.
Blood.

			RIPLEY
		I'm all right.

John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.

			JOHN
		Hold this against your nose.  It'll
		stop the flow.

She looks over at him questioningly.

			JOHN
		I'm a doctor.

She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops.
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet.
He shakes them off.

			ANTHONY
		No - please.  Just let me sit.
		Awhile.

He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his
cheek.

			ANTHONY
		Damn it.

			RIPLEY
		What was that?

			ANTHONY
		The reason I'm down here.

John points to his own eyes.

			JOHN
		Visions.

			ANTHONY
		Dreams.

			RIPLEY
		Androids can't dream...

			ANTHONY
		That's probably what they thought when
		they built me.  But my brain is cyber-
		organic - patterned after the human
		brain - it functions the same way a
		human brain does.  It accumulates random
		images and sensations during waking 
		hours, but unlike the human brain that
		sloughs them off during sleep --

			RIPLEY
		Androids don't sleep.

			ANTHONY
		Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later
		models, but I don't.  Do you know what 
		happens to the human brain when it is
		deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off
		the dreams while you're awake, as 
		hallucinations.  Same thing with me.
		For twenty years I absorbed data on this
		planetoid.  A little after we lost contact
		with Earth the visions started.  They
		thought I was insane.  I had to explain 
		that it was because I was an android.
		They liked that even less.

			RIPLEY
		What did you see?

			ANTHONY
		What I always see.  Images of Monsters.
		Demons.

			JOHN
		They're portents.  They stand for an
		evil yet to come.

			ANTHONY
		Just images I've absorbed from those old
		books and have no way to get rid of.

			RIPLEY
		I saw the inside of your cell.

			ANTHONY
		     (shrugs)
		My head is full of them.  I try to get
		them out any way I can.

His eyelids droop.

			JOHN
		You need sleep.

			ANTHONY
		I know that.  I'll settle for rest.

He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch.

			RIPLEY
		Stay with him.

Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.

			JOHN
		No.  We all need rest.  You especially.

Ripley considers him.

			JOHN
		Doctor's orders.

She smiles and sits.

			JOHN
		Besides, you see what happens when you
		get ahead of us.  We should stay together.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  He's still above us, anyway.

			JOHN
		What do you mean?

			RIPLEY
		I've faced this evil twice before - I
		guess I've gotten sensitive to it --
		     (beat)
		You're really a Doctor?

John pats his canvas bag.

			JOHN
		See my bag?

			RIPLEY
		What's that book?

			JOHN
		Just a book.

			RIPLEY
		I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who
		says we can't leave the planet without
		the library.
			
			JOHN
		It's just... a medical book I might need.

			RIPLEY
		You don't have any food in there, do you?

			JOHN
		Only if you can eat bandages.

Ripley rubs her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		In a few hours that's going to sound
		good.  Going in and out of suspended
		animation - Christ I probably haven't
		eaten in a year.

			ANTHONY
		    (without opening eyes)
		You should've eaten the bread.

			RIPLEY AND JOHN
		Rest!

Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall.
Closes her eyes.  Time passes.
Her brow knits.
John sees this.

			JOHN
		You all right?

			RIPLEY
		Aces.

			JOHN
		You weren't hurt when I landed on you?
		Bruised a rib?

He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock.
Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm.

			RIPLEY
		Are you sure you're a doctor?

He withdraws his hands.

			JOHN
		Sort of.  My father passed on when we 
		first came here.  The Abbey's Physician -
		Father Anselm - took me in.  He really
		raised me --
			  (pause)
		Taught me what he could before he
		passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

			RIPLEY
		Well, I'm just hungry.

			JOHN
		You haven't eaten since I took you
		out of your tube.

			RIPLEY
		You did that...

She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over.

			RIPLEY
		You burned yourself on the escape pod.

Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you, I guess.

They look into each other's eyes --

			ANTHONY O/S
		You should've eaten the bread.

Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands.
Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand.

			ANTHONY
		Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

They start into...


A NARROW CORRIDOR

Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them.
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.


INT. LADDER SHAFT

A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere.
Seems at least a mile long.
The group climbs...


A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR

Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head.
Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor.

John kneels, dips his fingertips --

			JOHN
		Blood.
		     (sniffs)
		Mixed with sea water.

			ANTHONY
		We're getting close to the center of
		the arc -- near the sea.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

			JOHN
		Getting close...

John HEARS somthing.
Raises his hand -- "stop"
The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall.

John takes Anthony's staff.
Moves forward with it held out in front of him...
WHIRLS around a blind corner --
SHOVES something against the wall --
Thump!
It struggles --

Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers --
Revealing:

			RIPLEY
		The Abbot.

Cassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild.
Anthony's staff across his throat. 
John pulls back.

			JOHN
		Father --

			RIPLEY
		   (sarcastic)
		What are you doing down here, father?
		You look like you've seen something
		that doesn't exist.

The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down.

			ABBOT
		I was their spiritual leader.  I was not
		prepared to lead them in battle.
		Not against that thing.

			JOHN
		No one could be.

			RIPLEY
		I thought you said the evil was inside
		me -- that sealing me up was the answer
		to all your problems?

			ABBOT
		Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought
		to us!

			RIPLEY
		I only tried to warn you.

			ABBOT
		What are you doing with this woman --?

			JOHN
		We are going to the Technology Room.
		Trying to find some way to fight --

			ABBOT
		You don't join the devil to fight the
		devil.

			ANTHONY
		She's helping us --

			ABBOT
		Look who defends the deceiver -- the one
		who isn't even human.  John, can't you see
		what is happening?  On ancient Earth,
		during the Black Death - many believed
		that God had abandoned them, so they
		appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him
		hoping to save their bodies - losing their
		souls in the bargain.

			RIPLEY
		Father, we're all on the run from the 
		same monster so let's not resort to the
		fire and brimstone routine.  I've been
		enlightened about your "movement."
		Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
		planet of heretics.

			JOHN
		Please. 

The time for pretense is past.

			ABBOT
		All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. 

			JOHN
		Sir --?

			ABBOT
		I do what I have to do to keep the
		Brotherhood together.  We all gave up
		believing in Earth a long time ago.  How
		do you think they would feel if told
		their exiled was in vain?  That the
		holocaust they were trying to avoid
		never occured?  Those men up there have
		grown to live with it.

			RIPLEY
		And with you as their leader.

The Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp.

			ABBOT
		You threatened the status quo.

			RIPLEY
		So you, protector of knowledge and truth,
		lied to them.

			ABBOT
		Only about you.  The rest I still
		believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun
		there is no way it could have survived
		being reduced to Barbarism.

			RIPLEY
		You're as bad as the Company.

			JOHN
		Ripley --

			RIPLEY
		That's why you ran.  After all your talk
		death stared you in the face and you
		were afraid.

			ABBOT
		Not afraid of death.

			RIPLEY
		The Alien.

			ANTHONY
		The Organism.

			ABBOT
		The Devil.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR

The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor.
Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys.
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted.
Warped by years of water dripping from above.
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles
held high...


ANTHONY

Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down --
SNAPP!!!
Everybody stops at the sound.

			ABBOT
		What was that?

Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--

			ANTHONY
		Man trap.

They lower their candles.  Look to:

THE FLOOR

Interspersed throughout the timbers --
Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS.
Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

			ANTHONY
		In case anyone tried to get in and
		tamper with the technology.

The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of
man traps.  Nobody moves.

			ABBOT
		What do we do?

			RIPLEY
		Don't move.  Don't breath.

			ABBOT
		We can't just stand here and wait.

			RIPLEY
		Floor's too unstable to try to walk
		around them.

John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall.
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him.
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws...
SNAP!!

The others jump at the sound --

			ABBOT
		John - what are you doing?

John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws.
Moves to the next trap --
Snap!!

			RIPLEY
		He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:
		Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.
		      (proud of him)
		Good work, Father John.

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Let's go.

Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her.  
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath --
It's METAL.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
SNAP!!


THE FOUR

Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM

A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


BACK IN THE CORRIDOR

Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

			JOHN
		I just - are you allright?

			RIPLEY
		Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
		feel my age.
		       (smiles)
		Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a
		hundred.

She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...

			JOHN
		Hello?

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.


BEHIND THE PLANK

A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

			JOHN
		I think this is it.

Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.

			ABBOT
		Technology.

			RIPLEY
		Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

			ABBOT
		     (to Ripley)
		Go ahead.

			RIPLEY
		Go ahead and what?

			ABBOT
		Open the door, woman.

			RIPLEY
		I'll get to it, but listen to me --
		you may dress like you're living in
		the middle ages but you can't treat
		me like your chambermaid, or whatever
		Monks had.


UP THE HALL - ANTHONY

Hears the sound again.  Turns.
Nothing again.
He pauses... Turns back quickly --

The wooden wall MOVES - steps forward --


THE ALIEN

Adapted itself to look like WOOD.

It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio-
mechnoid alien appearance...!


ANTHONY POV

The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his
many Medieval images of demons.  He hears the Alien's hollow,
raspy breath.  It glides towards him...

Anthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes --
SNAP!!
The STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle.
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow.

He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision --
Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him --
He screams.  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH --!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is trying to work.  She punches numbers into the keyboard.
She is too exhausted to see straight.
They HEAR the scream --
John RUNS back --
Traps SNAPPING around him --
Ripley turns towards the sound --
The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --

			ABBOT
		OPEN IT!!

Ripley knits her brows.  Forces herself to focus.
Her fingers punch the keys.


THE ALIEN

Steps towards Anthony --
Snap-snap-SNAP-AP-!!
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs --


HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL - JOHN

SNAP!!
His cassock is snagged in a trap.
He TEARS right out of it --
AT THE END OF THE HALL

Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien.
He WHACKS at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant.

The Alien LIFTS him up to face him.  Anthony SCREAMS as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain --
Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.


FACE TO FACE WITH THE ALIEN

Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with
his own android arms.  His extra-human strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth, eyeless face.

The Alien considers him.  Its thin, almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth.  The jaws spread,
making room for the distended tongue:

The Alien HISSES --
PUTS OUT Anthony's EYES with a thin stream of ACIDIC SALIVA --
Artificial skin BUBBLES AND BLISTERS --


JOHN

Picks up Anthony's staff.
Begins to FLAIL away at the demon.


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.

			ABBOT
		What's wrong?!

Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment.
The wires are so old they've broken.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.

She BITES the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation.
TWISTS the bare wire ends together...
Sweat runs into her eyes.


JOHN

WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff --
Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go.
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered,
pulpy mass, eyes gone.


RIPLEY

Finishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.
Her fingers FLY across the keys --


THE ALIEN

Tail wraps around John's waist --
Pulls him towards it --
LIFTS him - turns him upside down --

Lips PULL BACK --

John's hands GROPE at the floor --

Sharp metal teeth SPREAD --


THE DOOR KEYBOARD

Lights:  CODE ACCEPTED
Ripley's head whips towards the corridor --


JOHN

His hand closes around the end of one of the traps --
He brings it up --
SNAP!!
It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -!
The Beast bellows!!
Whips its head from side to side --
Can't shake off the trap --
ACID BLOOD sprays out --!
Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor.


THE DOOR

Opens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH!
The Abbot LEAPS inside --

			RIPLEY
		It's open!!


JOHN

PRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap.
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android --
Back up the corridor --


RIPLEY

Stands in open Technology Room doorway --

			ABBOT
		Close it -- close it -- it's coming -

			RIPLEY
		We wait.  John!!

John and Anthony appear out of the shadows --
Run/hobble towards the door --


THE ALIEN

Acid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free.
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger --
RUNS up the hall --


RIPLEY

Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room.
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard.
She punches keys --

			ABBOT
		Hurry --

			JOHN
		HURRY!!


THE ALIEN

Yards away -- Limping.  Hissing.
ANGRY.


THE KEYBOARD

Acceptance tone "bings."
The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
INCHES...

The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


WINDMILLS

Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)

Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


RIPLEY

She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


IN THE TUBE

Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

			RIPLEY
		No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother
		fucker!!

The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube --
Like it's taking her from behind!

Ripley looks down into the sleep tube:

Newt is gone.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley.
Thin lips pull back for a kiss.

She SCREAMS.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY

Ripley opens her eyes.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
She's still in the room with the windmills.
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream.
She looks around:

John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment.
He smiles a relieved smile.

			JOHN
		I thought we'd lost you.

			RIPLEY
		What are you writing?

			JOHN
		Last will and testament.
		      (beat)
		Just kidding.

She looks to her left:
Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out.

			RIPLEY
		Is he --?

			JOHN
		Resting.
		      (shakes his head)
		He'll be fine.

			ANTHONY
		No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

			RIPLEY
		I'm sorry.

			ANTHONY
		It's ironic.  I guess my visions were
		prescience after all.  How will I ever
		resolve that with my artifical con-
		science?

A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to
The Abbot.  He's pacing.

			ABBOT
		Do you see what you've delivered us
		into?

			RIPLEY
		Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to
		kick your -- ahh --

Ripley tries to stand - her head spins.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		Oh shit.

The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the Big Boy -?

The Abbot points to the door.

			ABBOT
		On the other side of that door.
		Waiting for us to starve to death.

Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.

			RIPLEY
		It's playing with us.  It could get in
		here any time it wants.

			ABBOT
		Why should he enter?  He knows that one
		of the people in this room is in league
		with him.

			JOHN
		Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so
		to speak.

			ABBOT
		Maybe more than one of us.

			RIPLEY
		Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

She looks at the windmills.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		This is your technology?

			ABBOT
		Even this is forbidden to us.

			RIPLEY
		Well then, the facts are that we're screwed.

She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills.

			RIPLEY
		An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your
		atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds
		generated down here --
		     (looks at the floor)
		Windmills use the natural surface winds
		to turn wheels underground, create tides
		on the seas to recirculate your water...

			ANTHONY
		More than that.  There are pumps beneath
		the floor - I can feel their vibration.

			RIPLEY
		Probably pumping this air through charcoal
		filters.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		It gets colder all the time here, right?

John looks at her questioningly.

			JOHN
		Yes...

			RIPLEY
		Your wood burning fires throw soot into
		the atmosphere, building the cloud layer -
		cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the
		planet, forcing you to burn more wood.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			ANTHONY
		The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth
		almost destroyed itself in the late 20th
		century.

			RIPLEY
		Don't you see?  This is a planet set to
		self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two
		hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is
		finite.  If the plants die the fires will
		eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid
		will be dead - Everyone will die.

The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a Marathon.

			ABBOT
		It's here.  I was just hoping I would be
		dead long before it came to this.

			JOHN
		What?

			ABBOT
		We're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

			RIPLEY
		Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?

			ABBOT
		The punishment for our crime was death.

Anthony sits up.

			ANTHONY
		This planet is the supreme triumph of
		planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of
		primitive materials with an atmosphere
		processing system as fragile as a real
		environment but not replenishable.

The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...

			ABBOT
		Poetic justice for the anti-technologists.
		The Company's best work.  You know, I used
		to be a corporate executive.  Middle range
		V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.
		I chucked it all and joined the order.
		Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here,
		being chairman of the board...

			RIPLEY
		No, now I understand why I landed here.
		To join you happy lunatics in your 
		deaths.

Ripley moves away...
John starts after her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, wait --

The Abbot stands, blocks his way.

			ABBOT
		Where can she go?  She's trapped.
		       (beat)
		Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison
		in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.
		Sparklets of light - dance with the june
		bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare
		coming to danceintheshadowof...

John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot.
He begins to speak faster.  Faster.
He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate --
A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

			ABBOT
		RidingthewildwindsofchangeNoescapeNo

		foryouuuuuuuuu --*

SPLORTCH-KT--!!
The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!!
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement.
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John.
John SCREAMS.


A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER

Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot.
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's
body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system.

Ripley SCREAMS.
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her --
She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS --
-- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE --
WHACK-K -!!
BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room --

It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the
Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears.

			RIPLEY
		BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking
		head!

			ANTHONY
		I didn't have to see that to know what
		that means.

			RIPLEY
		He sent him to us.  That bastard outside.
		I can't get away from him.  He's fucking
		with my mind.  He's my punishment!

			ANTHONY
		I'm confused.  Before you said it came out
		of the torso, not the head --

			RIPLEY
		I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

John comes up next to her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, don't --

She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.

			RIPLEY
		I should just wait for the air to run out...

			JOHN
		I believe - I know - that we can win --
		there is an answer in our books.

			RIPLEY
		Your books?  Your books are gone, Brother.
		Your world is gone.  Once that thing starts
		to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if
		they aren't already - are dead.

			JOHN	
		If that's true, then all of us, the books,
		are consigned to ashes.

He clasps his hands and bows his head.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Plip - plop!
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet.
She stares at the blood.  Aahk.
Feels the PAIN again.
Runs her hand across her chest...

			ANTHONY O/S
		Ripley?

			RIPLEY
		What?

			ANTHONY
		There are several inconsistancies between
		this and the other Aliens you described.

			RIPLEY
		Give it up.

			ANTHONY
		I think this is important.  This may help
		us fight it.  The creature that I fought
		in the hall - when I first saw it, it had
		camoflaged itself to look like wood.

Ripley looks up.
			
			RIPLEY
		Wood?  When I saw it in my room it looked
		the way it did before -- black, mechanical --
		unless that was a dream.

			ANTHONY
		I don't think it was.  I think that this 
		creature, if it is the efficient predator
		that you say it is, has the ability to
		adapt to its environment.

			RIPLEY
		Then the reason they've always looked the
		same to me is that I only ever saw them in
		the same environment.

			ANTHONY
		Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
		development -- you saw a queen -- This
		could be like a King ant -- more highly
		advanced than the drone, bred for 
		survival -?

			JOHN
		How does this explain the thing that came
		out of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

			RIPLEY
		Maybe it can deposit different types of
		eggs.  The chest burster is probably
		dormant until the host eats - The first
		one I ever saw came out of Kane after he
		started to eat --

And in one horrible moment she realizes:
She hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...

			RIPLEY
		No.

Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?

			JOHN
		No what?

			RIPLEY
		No, we're not beat yet, Father --

			JOHN
		Brother --

Ripley gets up.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,
		then maybe we can use that.  We can beat
		this bastard.  We can get to my ship.
		We can live.

								CUT TO:

INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM

John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

			ANTHONY
		Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and
		crippled I would only slow you down.
		Give him time to figure out what you're
		doing.  Just leave me my staff.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

			ANTHONY
		Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

			RIPLEY
		Sit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		He could be waiting on the other side
		of that door.  We might not get ten feet
		before he kills the three of us.

He shakes his head.

			JOHN
		We had better go, then.

He smiles.
She smiles back.
They move up the ladder.

It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to


AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT

The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John
climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:

AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,
over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead.

The water sparkles with a golden glow.

			JOHN
		Must be day on the surface of the planet.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the light coming from?
	
			JOHN
		Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down
		great shafts -- through lenses.  That's
		what they make in the glass factory. 
		Lenses.  Look --

She turns:

A HUGE WATERFALL

Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

			JOHN
		Opens to the surface.  Water flows in
		and out.  I don't know how.  There's one
		at either end.  I came down on the other
		side.

			RIPLEY
		What do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

			JOHN
		We cross.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY

Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

			ANTHONY
		Now the seer can only see what God wants
		him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
		and I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

			ANTHONY
		John?  Ripley?

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
He knows it is not.

			ANTHONY
		Well come then.  I haven't got forever.

A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.
He doesn't have to see what is here.


THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT

The leather boat makes its way across the sea.
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.
As night falls she takes the oars.

The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-
like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.

			RIPLEY
		Your hands okay?

			JOHN
		They'll be fine.  You've been on
		a boat before.

Ripley squints ahead of them.
The ocean seems to go on forever.

			RIPLEY
		I was a warrant officer on a ship --
		but I did all my sailing in space.

			JOHN		
		Father Anselm used to take me on his
		coracle when I was little.

Ripley leans forward - scans his face.

			RIPLEY
		How old were you when they towed
		this satellite out here?	

			JOHN
		Five.  The Abbot said they put us to 
		sleep for the thirty years it took
		to get here.  We've had almost forty
		more.  Until now.

			RIPLEY
		What happened to your mother?

			JOHN
		Never had one.  I mean, never knew her.
		I mean, I did, once.  She left my father
		when he joined the movement.  If she
		hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept
		the other children with the women, on
		Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like
		a dream.

Ripley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.

			RIPLEY
		Did you know that I was a mother?

			JOHN
		The girl in the ship with -?

			RIPLEY
		No.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my
		daughter.  My daughter.  I have - had
		I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.
		Kathy.  She was nine when I signed on to
		the Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before
		you know it I said.  My shares would have
		set us up good.  Then I lost sixty years
		floating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks
		to the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,
		70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little
		girl who's mother never came home.

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.

			RIPLEY
		They said I should have been happy to be
		alive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went
		back the second time.  Not so I could
		fight it -- You can't fight it -- So
		I could let it kill me.

She rubs her chest --

			JOHN
		You didn't choose to get lost in space.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks for the try Father --

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution.
		I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.
		I couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But
		I can be a good mother to you.  I can make
		sure you survive.

Suddenly they feel rain --
Ripley holds out her hand.
Her eyes open wide at what she sees.
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:

The Ocean has become red with BLOOD.
Blood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

John looks up.

			JOHN
		From the levels above.

His face goes white.

			JOHN
		He must have slaughtered all --

			RIPLEY
		Don't think about it.  Don't think about
		what's up there.  Just row.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


A SHAPE

Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT

All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT

Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


UP THE LADDER

A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT

Ripley and John come up from the level below.

			RIPLEY
		Holy shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

			JOHN
		There's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

			RIPLEY
		Stop.  How far?

			JOHN
		We're right below the Abbey now.

They cross the smoldering field.
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet --
Ripley pull him to one side.


THE MONASTERY LEVEL

Heaven has become HELL.
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened.
FIRES burn everywhere.  Air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's 
hinges.  They look at the grim tableau:

Monks impaled on their own pikes.
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes.
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.


THE MONASTERY

Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows.
Ripley takes a step towards it --
Reaches back and pulls John...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT

The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow.
Small fires burn out of control around the room.
Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat.
Ripley and John enter.

			JOHN
		This is the glassworks.  They have
		tools here --
			(spots)
		Kyle --

He runs across the room --


BROTHER KYLE

Sits calmly at the Marver table.
He places playing cards on the table in front of him.
Solitaire.  
He sings to himself quietly.

			KYLE
		     (sotto)
		Can't see my baby.
		Don't see my baby.  Bay be.

John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet.
The playing cards fall to the floor --
Kyle watches them, not John.

			JOHN
		Kyle.  Brother Kyle.

			KYLE
		Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup.
		Black king on red queen, put the
		ace up --

John SHAKES him.

			JOHN
		Kyle goddammit!

Ripley moves closer.

			RIPLEY
		John - it's too late --

Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster.

			KYLE
		Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.
		Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-
		boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma
		looma --

Ripley and John look at each other.
They know what this means.
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table.
Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes.
A tear runs down his cheek.

			JOHN
		Keep singing, my friend.

John loops the rope around Kyle's neck.
Strangles him.
Eases the lifeless body to the floor.
Stares at it.


RIPLEY

Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and
balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John.

			JOHN
		I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I
		killed him.

			RIPLEY
		You had to.  You're supposed to end
		suffering.

She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes.

			RIPLEY
		Let's get the hell out of here.


INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Ripley and John move up the stairs.
Flickering orange lit from below.
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors.


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it,
books out of shelves, hanging on their chains.

			RIPLEY
		He's made a mess.

John pushes ahead of her.

			JOHN
		No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I 
		did this.

He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock --

			JOHN
		Here - philosophy - we'll start here --

AAAROO --!
A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks --
WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor --
Licks his face.

			JOHN
		Mattias!

The happy dog leaps all over his master.

			JOHN		
		He waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My
		dog.  Good fellow.

Ripley crosses to them.

			RIPLEY
		I'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably
		only got a few minutes before this
		entire place goes up in flames.  Just
		grab whatever books you want and --

Ripley leans in to pet Mattias.
Mattias draws his lip back.  Growls.
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder.

She turns around slowly...


THE ALIEN

Standing in the open doorway.
It's in bad shape from the man traps.
Lost a foot.  Tongue hanging out, useless.
Parts of it look like wood.  Parts of it look like wheat.

It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body --
POPS off his head like a grape from the bunch.
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet.

I could swear it's trying to smile.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Back against the book stacks.
John grabs Mattias' collar.
The Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...

			JOHN
		Easy, boy...

			RIPLEY
		Is there another way out?

			JOHN
		Not that will do us any good.


THE ALIEN

Limps into the room dragging one foot.
It's breathing is labored.  Dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it.

			JOHN
		We hurt it.

The Alien draws itself up to its full height --
Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.

			RIPLEY
		You wanna give it a bandage?  Look --
		Where is my ship from here?

			JOHN
		On the roof directly above this room.

			RIPLEY
		Here's the plan --
		
			JOHN
		But the books --

			RIPLEY
		Forget the books!

RUFF!!
Mattias pulls free from John's grasp --
Runs to the Alien --

			RIPLEY
		Shit.


MATTIAS

Snaps and barks at the Alien --
Leaping about to dodge its claws.
Draws its attention --


RIPLEY AND JOHN

RUN at the Alien.
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail.
John swings the iron rod -- THWAP -!
HITS the Alien across the back of its bulbous head --

It turns to him --

SPLIIIITCH -!
Ripley SHOVES the blowing iron into the Alien's torso.
His acid blood SPURTS out the end of the hollow tube --
SPLATTERS Ripley's cassock - she TEARS it off --

John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back.

The Alien SPINS in a circle --
Blood SPRAYING around him -

Creating a CIRCLE OF FIRE about him --
IGNITING the books --

			JOHN
		No!  THE BOOKS!!

			RIPLEY
		Don't --!

John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him --
The ACID EATS through the wooden floor --


THE FLOOR COLLAPSES

The Alien, John and Ripley PLUMMET down -!
THROUGH the next floor --


INTO THE GLASSWORKS

The Alien FALLS into the molten glass vat --
SCREECHES - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid.


JOHN

Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught -
DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the
Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down:

He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its
right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair
where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up:

Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.

			JOHN
		Are you all right?

Ripley grunts an affirmative response.
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to
the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling.
John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to
sweat.
A drop of sweat falls...
HSSS!
POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass --


RIPLEY

Tries to pull herself up to the floor above --
The next level is a raging fire.

She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -!
Falls the two stories.
Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact.


JOHN

Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace.
He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising --

			JOHN
		Ripley -!

Ripley shakily gets to her feet.
Hops on one foot.

			RIPLEY
		Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck
		out of --

SUDDENLY

THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass.
SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot -
translucent -- covered with -- 
It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!!

Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank --
It tries to climb out --

Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out.
She falls face down on the floor --
Rolls over --

THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat --
She SCREAMS --


JOHN

Grabs the Flying Fox handle.
SWINGS down the rope - across the room --
PAST the Alien --

It turns away from Ripley -
She scrambles across the floor...

John lands HARD.
Points --

			JOHN
		Ripley - the lever!!

Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever.

The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace --

RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst!
Putting out the fire with her hand --
Pulls --


THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER

DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons --
RAINS DOWN on the Alien. 
It HOWLS in pain --

The Molten Glass instantly COOLS --
The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!!
EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!!

Ripley helps John off the floor.
They are battered.  Bloody.
They look into the vat.
The steam clears...

The room is littered with Alien Bits.
Each piece is encased in glass --
Trapped like a fly in amber.

			JOHN
		Saw that happen to a bottle once.

			RIPLEY
		    (panting)
		Beat... Beat him - ugh --

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out.
John gives her an arm for support.

			JOHN
		We've got to get to the Library --

			RIPLEY
		Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --

They look up:

Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor.
BARKS...


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

An INFERNO.
Every bookshelf ablaze.  The floor dotted with pools of flame.
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat --

John tries to enter the room --
Ripley grabs him --

			RIPLEY
		Don't be stupid --

			JOHN
		Some of them!  I've got to save some of
		them!  Mattias!!

Mattias yelps in response.  Threads his way through to them.
Ripley spins him to face her.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

			RIPLEY
		They're lost.  You did your best.  If
		you get out, it wasn't in vain.
		We've got to live!!

She YANKS him into the hallway --

							CUT TO:

EXT. MONASTERY - THE ROOF - NIGHT

Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.  John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.  John looks around:

The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.  The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.  The Library is in flames.

John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.

			RIPLEY O/S
		Come on in!

John and Mattias step through --


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGHT

Ripley CLICKS on the lights.
John lifts Mattias into the hatch.

			JOHN
		The Library --

			RIPLEY
		I told you -- the Earth is still there --

Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time.
Her brows knit.  She TAPS the gauge.

			RIPLEY
		Not working.

			JOHN
		What does that mean?

			RIPLEY
		It means I don't know how long I was
		in hyper sleep.

			JOHN
		It means the Abbot could've been right --
		
			RIPLEY
		It means my clock isn't working.  We have
		to get out of here.  Even if he was right
		this ship's onboard computer is filled 
		with man's knowledge.

			JOHN
		Not everything.  Some things will be
		lost forever. 

			RIPLEY
		Then man starts over.  He's done it
		before.

She pushes a few buttons.  Somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source HUMS to life.  THROBBING through the soles
of John's feet.  Ripley is absorbed in her work.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  The seals weren't broken so
		we're probably clear.  But those dead
		monks out there are going to start
		hatching soon.  Let's get ready to
		take off.

			JOHN
		What can I do?

			RIPLEY
		Here, I need a compressor tank from
		in that compartment.

She motions towards an open door.
John enters the compartment.
Whoosh-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

			JOHN
		Hey!  What?!

He looks out the window in the door.  

Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the
door.

			JOHN
		Hey - I'm locked in.

Mattias scratches at the door.

			RIPLEY
		I know.  I locked you in.

			JOHN
		What?

			RIPLEY
		I'm not going with you.  I've got one
		inside me.
	
			JOHN
		What?!  You can't --

She runs a hand across her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		I figured it out.  That's why it didn't
		kill me.  He must have impregnated me
		when I was in the stasis tube.
		    (remembers nightmare)
		It hasn't come out yet because I 
		haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So
		either I eat and it kills me or I don't
		eat and I starve to death.  Either way 
		I die.

John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.

			JOHN	
		My book -- I know what to do --

			RIPLEY
		What, an exorcism?  No good.

			JOHN
		You can't do this.  Ripley - listen
		to me - you're confusing feeling of
		guilt for actual sin - I can help you --

			RIPLEY
		    (ignoring)
		I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes
		the Colony's gravitational pull this
		compartment will open.  Then all you have 
		to do is get into the Stasis tube with
		Mattias and press the blue button.  With
		any luck a freighter or something will
		pick you up.  Good luck.

He pounds his fists against the door.

			JOHN
		NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.
		You can't let it win.

She turns away from the door.

			RIPLEY
		It always wins.  We killed it, but it's
		still inside me -- You're my last chance.
		If I can keep you alive it'll make up
		for all those I've lost.

			JOHN
		Listen to me!  You have to let me try!
		Ripley:  You're MY only chance!

She's listening...

			JOHN
		I told you Father Anselm raised me.
		He raised me and when he was dying I
		couldn't do anything to save him.  I 
		didn't know enough.  It was my fault
		he died.  If you don't let me try to
		save you my body will live but my soul
		will be dead.

Ripley turns and stares at him.

			JOHN
		Please.

								CUT TO:


THE PAGE

A MEDIEVAL ETCHING.
A Monk vomits up the devil.

Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor.
John closes his eyes.
Closes the book.

He pours some water into a small plastic cup.
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it.
Wrinkles his nose - they smell --
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.

			RIPLEY
		What is this stuff?

			JOHN
		     (forceful)
		Something that will make you well.
		Something that will make you sick.

			RIPLEY
		I don't --

			JOHN
		Shut up and drink.

He lifts the back of Ripley's head --
FORCES the drink down her throat.

John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her.
Presses his two hands together in prayer.
Then balls them into one fist.
Takes a deep, preparatory breath...

Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough.
Her body starts to JERK --

John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH --
WHAMM -!!

Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves --

WHAM!  WHAM --!
John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm!

She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance --
HEAVES --

Ripley's back arches --
She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL --
Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards.

John BEARS down --
Pushes UP under her ribs --
FORCING the chest-burster up her throat --

Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her 
esophagus -- She's choking --

John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath --
Lowers his mouth to hers --
Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR.


THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER

SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth --

INTO JOHN'S!!
Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet.

John falls back against a computer console.
Gagging.  Fights to speak.

Ripley raises herself up on one elbow.
Alien mucous drooling down her chin.
Hair matted against her forehead.

			RIPLEY
		Why?
	
			JOHN
		Choking.  It was the only way.

He drops the open book in front of her:
She sees the etching.


JOHN

Gulps back the oozing slime.
Struggles to his feet.

			JOHN
		They knew.

			RIPLEY
		But you --

Ripley tries to stand - to go after him --
She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.

			RIPLEY
		You'll die --

John stumbles to the Pod door.  Turns back.

			JOHN	
		That's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If
		we were right, Heaven.  If we were wrong --
		either way, where we belong.  World of
		books.  Pages.

He draws the parchment out of his bag.
Drops it to the floor.

			JOHN
		You... are from the real world.

He starts to step through the door --
Mattias tries to follow.

			JOHN
		Stay -- both of you.

He exits the Pod.

Ripley drags herself across the floor.

			RIPLEY
		No - wait!  John!

To the Door.  Looks out:


BROTHER JOHN

Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof.
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey.

Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are
INCINERATED.

The heat of the flames grows.
She must pull back --
Reaches up for the door handle.
It closes with a THUD.

She rolls onto her back.
She weeps.  For the first time in years.
She's been absolved.

CREeeek -!!
The escape pod SHIFTS.
Ripley's eyes SNAP open --

The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to GIVE WAY.

Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilot's chair.  Pulls herself into the seat.
Straps herself in --


SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4

Blasts THROUGH the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon.
ROARS towards us - past us.


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 = DAY

Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube.
Rubs under his chin.  Is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor --


JOHN'S PARCHMENT

Ripley picks it up and unrolls it.
She hears John's voice:

			JOHN V.O.
		I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter
		Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know
		the Abbot was wrong.  There is a great
		evil here.  I have seen it.  I put pen to
		paper now lest this plague - this creature
		stills my hand.  I have gone down below -
		both to try to warn the others and get 
		the woman - Ripley - get from her some
		clue as to how to battle this evil, or
		at least to make my peace for not
		defending her.  She believes there is
		still and Earth and I hope she is right.
		I hope she will be able to find out.
		I hope she can find some rest for the
		devils that torment her.

Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console.  Pulls a pen from it's holder.  She adds:

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Whether the Earth exists or not, whether
		we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold
		vacuum of space, she has.

She sets her course.
Gets back into her tube.
Closes the lid.

Screenplay by Peter Briggs

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

We OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite 
depths of space.  As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these 
specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and 
racing toward us.  Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick 
glimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large 
brownish planet.  Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere.  
It seems to be manmade.  Or at least artificial.

EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The planet is dead, barren.  Death Valley on a grand scale.  We watch 
the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last 
burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.  A 
BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back 
into an eerie silence.

EXT.  FISSURE CANYON - DAY

We're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.  A howling wind 
whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.  About 
seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a 
cave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.  We hear a 
mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE 
humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet 
tall.  They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on 
permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of 
aborigine and ultra-hi-tech.  In their hands are circular metal discs; 
'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase.

PREDATOR-VISION.  

From their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES.  
The entrance registers as a black gaping void.

INT.  FISSURE NEST TUNNEL

The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's 
banshee wailing.  The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling 
at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus.  
He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a 
deep breath of the air.  A curious speckled pattern runs across his 
wide forehead, marking him 
different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles 
has been sheared away.  We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of 
the hunting party.  He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the 
tunnel.

Several feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured 
biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.  He 
hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who 
has found something.

The other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.  Skewered 
on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented 
tail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform.  
BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling 
spears and elaborately-shaped swords.  Several shoulder-mounted plasma 
cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' 
helmets.  Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances.  
One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area.

PREDATOR-VISION.  

He switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra-
violet, enhanced motion-tracking.  Nothing.

He's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the 
skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical 
growth on the floor.  A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight 
through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.  A 
gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS 
spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.  The 
band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they 
themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.  The carnage is 
swift and terrifying, a blur of motion.

Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive 
with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.  One PREDATOR is pinned 
against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.  The ALIEN claws away 
his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue, 
extended toward him with pile-driver speed.  He reaches down, grasping 
the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc 
that terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.  Big mistake.  The two 
are in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across 
the PREDATOR's head.  While their technology seems to be resistant to 
it, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into 
the PREDATOR's skin.  He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS 
PIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face. 

It all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no 
question as to who were the victors.  The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea 
of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.  As his 
companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK 
steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.  The first 
PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other.  
What he finds causes him to react with
pity and disgust.  His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles 
clicking frailly, half his head burnt away.  BROKEN TUSK watches the 
ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to 
him.  He takes it, knowing what has to be done.  Rolling the knife 
quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick 
seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen 
hunter.  This unpleasant task accomplished,

BROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.  A dark 
shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR 
shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.  It hovers in the air with little more 
than a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.  The surviving PREDATORS leap 
aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men 
returning from combat.

One more thing need to be done.  BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a 
sequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.  A countdown is 
displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED 
BEEPING.  He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes 
smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting.

EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY

A white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the 
PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.  The shuttlecraft pulls quickly 
away, disappearing into the clouds.

EXT.  SPACE

A large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the 
PREDATOR Mothership.  The shuttle heads swiftly towards it. 


INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY

An airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the 
Mothership's docking bay.  An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut 
takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly 
look up at them.  Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious 
mixture of old and new.  An elaborate frieze written in alien script 
runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed 
into it.  Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN 
TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them. 

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship.  
BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a 
cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which 
constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.  He peers over 
the protective railing. 

WHAT HE SEES is magnificent:  a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the 
ALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.  Each of it's limbs is 
tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.  To the rear, 
it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling.  
A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly 
defying gravity.  As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam - 
similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a 
view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.  This done, a manipulator are 
carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a 
hatchway in the floor.  It's an assembly-line of almost frightening 
mechanical efficiency.

EXT.  SPACE

We see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the 
planet into deep space.  The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are 
seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt.

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to 
red, BEEPING rapidly.  BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter 
from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a 
representation of a QUEEN's head.  The manipulator arm swiftly grasps 
the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor.  
The causes the QUEEN to go
berserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.  She's 
obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen.  
The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an 
energy-filled blast furnace.  The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops 
in, and is no more.

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS

An orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows 
into long-empty orbs.  BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat 
slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable 
arsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across 
the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.  He regards it 
for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before 
finally getting to his feet. 

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The lights in the gallery are dimmer when BROKEN TUSK enters.  He 
watches the cherry-red beam of the gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock onto 
one of the EGGS, then runs his hand in sequence over the control board.  
The manipulator arm swings over, seizing the egg and loading it onto a 
waiting pallet. 

BROKEN TUSK points his finger at the QUEEN and makes a guttural 
CLICKING SOUND from deep in his throat.  The effect is not unlike that 
of a child firing an imaginary gun.  As if reading BROKEN TOOTH's 
thoughts, the QUEEN lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous 
HISS of contempt.

EXT.  SPACE

In CENTER FRAME, the planet sits still and green, awash with nebulous 
clouds. A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT across our view, 
sunlight glinting from it's surface.  It's a rectangular satellite-
construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a 
latticework of steel tubing.  We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES O.S.  
Subspace chatter.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY

Imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of 
treetop foliage, and you've just drawn yourself a picture of the planet 
Ryushi.

Nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin 
Communications Relay Station.  Several inverted-'U'-shaped suspension 
cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of 
preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on 
platforms, much like a truncated oil-rig.  A navigation beacon flashes 
intermittently from a tall gantry tower above, while dominating the 
view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes 
high.  Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled 
haulage vehicle.  A flock of bird-like creatures fly past.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

We're in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with 
clusters of video readouts, somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air-
traffic control tower.  On the upper tier, a large circular holo-
display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw.  Thin 
trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air 
conditioning ducks, though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of 
the people manning the consoled here.  We move in on CASSIE DOLLANDER 
and ROB PARSONS, two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank.  
CASSIE listens carefully to something on her headset. 

CASSIE
Ah, negative on that request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'.  I've 
already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix.  Hold on 
my mark until I get back with some confirmation.  Rimward Traffic 
Control out.

She thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS.

CASSIE (CONT'D)
How's it looking?

PARSONS worriedly shakes his head.

PARSONS
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.

CASSIE
Better tell the boss.

PARSONS pulls out a coin.

PARSONS
Toss you for it.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

HIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling 
across her Oriental features.  Her eyes flicker warily from side-to-
side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to 
assess from where the next attack will come.  She doesn't have to wait 
long; two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her, striking 
without hesitation.

She expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly.  A persistent TONE 
begins to intrude O.S., like a telephone RINGING.  She tries to ignore 
it, but her concentration is clearly broken.  A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears 
from out of nowhere, his sword SWISHING towards her chest.  The blade 
plunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back.  She glances 
down in annoyed disbelief.

HIROKO
Fuck!  Holo off.

The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear.  She sheathes the 
sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to 
her desk. Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud.  The 
RINGING TONE stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel 
replaced with a black girl's face.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Noguchi.

CASSIE  (O.S., onscreen)
Something just came up on Deep Space Tracking.

HIROKO
What kind of 'something'?

CASSIE   (O.S., onscreen)
Easier if you come down and look.

HIROKO
I'm on my way.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY

An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain, 
climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty 
main-street.  A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds 
indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's 
approach.  The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt, 
while somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS.  

DON KAMEN, a lean man in his forties. climbs down from the cab mounted 
five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna. He 
adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the 
street towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in 
the gentle breeze.  A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open 
before him. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

KAMEN steps into the command center, nodding familiarly to the DUTY 
PERSONNEL.  A long-haired labrador rushes up to KAMEN, wagging it's 
tail. Her name is BREWSTER.  She's the base mascot.  KAMEN reaches down 
and ruffles it's fur.  He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier, 
pulling the French-plaited hair of ANNIE URIOSTE, an Italian systems-
mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console.

URIOSTE
You didn't wipe your feet coming in.

KAMEN
Well, it's okay.  You didn't tell me it was monsoon season going out.

PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.

PARSONS
Hey, buenos dias, cowboy.  When d'you blow in?

KAMEN places his hat on PARSONS' head and THUMPS it down.

KAMEN
Just got back.  Missed anything?

URIOSTE   (snorts)
Yeah.  We're almost out of beer.

PARSONS
Ahh, don't pay any attention to Urioste. She's still pissed that 
Noguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip.

KAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator.

KAMEN
Wasn't my trip, I just did the driving. 'Sides, freezing my butt off 
out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of 
a good time, either.

He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid.

PARSONS
Where'd you leave them?

KAMEN
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making 
their own way back tomorrow.

CASSIE
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.

KAMEN
Shit.  When?

CASSIE
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story 
on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

KAMEN looks ill.

KAMEN
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.

CASSIE
You win some, you loose some.

KAMEN
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything 
else you wanna ruin my day with?

CASSIE
No, but I got something that might interest you.

HIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket.

HIROKO
What've you got?

KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.  They 
turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of 
the neighboring solar system.

CASSIE
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen 
twenty-four local time.

PARSONS
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just 
to make sure.

CASSIE
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.

The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading 
towards the planet in the center of the display.  Computer notations 
accompany them.

CASSIE (CONT'D)
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a 
deep-space drive.

HIROKO
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.

PARSONS
That's what we thought.

HIROKO
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?

PARSONS
Done it already.  Nothing matches.

CASSIE
And if you thought that was interesting, watch this...

HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.

KAMEN
Jesus.

PARSONS
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're 
looking at.

KAMEN
Tactical nukes, maybe?

Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.  It's 
obviously not an appealing thought.

HIROKO
Where're they headed?

CASSIE
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's 
possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant 
glances. HIROKO seems worried.  She scratches her forehead.

HIROKO
I don't know what to make of this.  Get a copy of the telemetry relayed 
back to Antarctica Traffic Control.  Better alert the nearest RimCorp 
Base, too.

PARSONS nods, suddenly serious.

PARSONS
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?

HIROKO
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON

Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in 
gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana 
bayou.  A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for 
cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.  Seconds later, 
a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped 
hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME 
suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a 
swirl of spray.  The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES 
scatter.  ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol 
boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in 
the other.

YORK   (yelling)
You missed 'em, Ackland!

ACKLAND
Little fuckers move too fast.  Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the 
other side.

YORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.  The two 
bikes ROAR off in pursuit.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON

Up on a mud-bank, at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two 
blinking blue lights atop it, stands the camp.  It looks a little like 
a Bedouin bivouac, but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details.  
A hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips from a 
mug, while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber 
bullets into a belt-feed.  They 
watch as ACKLAND and YORK roar past WHOOPING.  MINH scrambles out of 
the way as a beer can lobbed by YORK CLATTERS to the ground near him. 

MINH
Crazy idiots.

BEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands, assessing him.

BEAUVAIS
Ahhh, they're just letting off some steam; don't let 'em get to you.  
Ackland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em.  Just a 
couple of weekend warriors...

She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing into the 
belt feed.  On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over-
the-shoulder guidance mechanism.

BEAUVAIS (CONT'D)
Nice howitzer you've got there.

MINH
Thanks.

BEAUVAIS
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?

MINH
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the 
rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock 
you a month's pay for just mentioning it.

He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt.

MINH (CONT'D)
Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it, 
though.

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

Against a sea of stars, a small metal shape HURTLES towards us, 
followed moments later by it's identical twin.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON

A strand of HIROKO's hair falls forward into her face, slick with rain.  
She brushes up at the miserable weather.  She and KAMEN are standing on 
one of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage 
vehicle we saw outside the base earlier.  Up on the side of the cab is 
painted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline, next to which is 
the legend 'BIG BERTHA'.  Two mechanics, JAN GUTTIEREZ and KEVIN 
DILLER, watch KAMEN point something out to HIROKO from the vantage 
point of KAMEN's crawler parked in the swamp nearby.

KAMEN
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the 
pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on 
these new plastics.

HIROKO
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module.  
That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares 
in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.

KAMEN shrugs.

KAMEN
If you want these things kept in working condition, that's the only 
choice you've got.

DILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ.

DILLER
Maybe she wouldn't be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while.

GUTTIEREZ
You offering?

A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF.  DILLER gets up to answer.

DILLER
Nah.  Freeze my dick off.

HIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMEN's comment.

HIROKO
I don't know.  I think we'll have to run it on a rota; one month down, 
one month operational.

DILLER leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across.

DILLER
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.

HIROKO
Thanks.

She turns back to KAMEN.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Let me sort this out and we'll go over the logistics in my office.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO peers at the display with undisguised concern.  A sense of 
urgency buzzes around the room.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
When?

CASSIE
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings 
are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too 
close for comfort.

HIROKO
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?

PARSONS looks up from his board in harassment.

PARSONS
Already working on it.

HIROKO
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.

She meets KAMEN's eyes.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Looks like you were right.  Someone's lobbed a pair of smart-missiles 
at us.

KAMEN shakes his head.

KAMEN
Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother?  
All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control 
net.  That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists.

PARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board.

PARSONS
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?

CASSIE
Okay, give me the numbers.

She flips a switch.  A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path 
sketched out in rectangular neon blocks.

EXT.  SPACE

A cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites, 
and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move.

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

The two pods ROAR towards us at immense speed.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked 
alteration in their course.

PARSONS
They've changed their heading again.

HIROKO
Compensate!

PARSONS
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.

CASSIE
What do you need?

PARSONS
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.

CASSIE
It's on the board.

EXT.  SPACE

Framed against the green backdrop of Ryushi, the PREDATOR pods rocket 
towards the communications platform.

CASSIE
Picking up velocity.

HIROKO
Match it!

A bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS' temple.

PARSONS
Not gonna make it...

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA, blotting out our view.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

One of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes, and three-quarters 
of the monitors abruptly turn to static.  PARSONS curses.

PARSONS
Goddammit!

He pulls off his headset with weary resignation.

PARSONS (CONT'D)
We've lost the downlink.  It's gone.

EXT.  SPACE

The mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end.  A gaping rent is torn  
through it; something sparks and flashes within.  The second pod 
accelerates off curving into the atmosphere.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK

A SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks up in time to see an 
object sear across the dusk sky.  He pulls his bike to a stationary 
hover.

YORK
Shit!  What's that?

ACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the 
ground.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few 
plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before 
settling back into an eerie silence.

ACKLAND
Meteor, I guess.

He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face.  THROUGH THEM 
he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops.

ACKLAND
D'you feel any impact shock?

YORK   (uncertain)
Not really.

He lowers the binoculars and frowns.

ACKLAND
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, 
and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.

YORK
Do you wanna head back and call it in?

ACKLAND   (hesitant)
I dunno... I dunno.  Something about this feels funny.

He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky.

ACKLAND (CONT'D)
That is the damndest impact I've ever saw...

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK

The earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the 
surrounding brush still aflame.  A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to 
the edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly.  We 
HEAR a LOW HUM, and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL.  Before the SCORPION 
can decide what to do, it's fate is sealed.  A large METAL CLAW comes 
down, crushing it in an instant.  A SECOND CLAW emerges, and a MACHINE 
heaves itself out of the hole, it's surface smoking with heat.  It 
pauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey, them moves 
purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting.  A hatch on the 
underside opens, and a complex delivery mechanism extends.  After a 
moment there's a LOW CLUNK, and the mechanism retracts.  In it's place 
is an ALIEN EGG.  The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing into the long 
reeds.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT

HIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMEN's crawler, her knees pulled up 
to her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night 
impenetrable.  Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the 
communications array strobe on-and-off.  Above the bar on the main 
street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with 
the words "TORCHY'S".  The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within 
become momentarily louder, and HIROKO glances over to see it's 
pressure-door CRASH back, disgorging several drunken people. KAMEN 
follows them through.  He spots HIROKO and heads over.

KAMEN
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.

HIROKO
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.

KAMEN
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?

She shakes her head, and manages a smile.

HIROKO
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too 
crowded for me.

KAMEN
Not too much of the socializing type, then?

HIROKO
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.

KAMEN LAUGHS.  HIROKO is straight-faced.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary 
installations.

KAMEN
Is that a fact.

HIROKO
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and 
want to claw open a vacuum hatch.

KAMEN
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?

HIROKO
Four.

KAMEN
And before that?

HIROKO
Six month stint on Datus.

KAMEN
Only six?

HIROKO
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?

KAMEN
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.

HIROKO shrugs.  Thinks about it.

HIROKO
I don't know.  I guess I've just never found anywhere I really felt at 
home.

She hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease.  
KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads.

KAMEN
What is that?

HIROKO
Real man' drink.

She offers the glass to him.  He takes it and sniff cautiously.

KAMEN
Seltzer?

HIROKO
Want some?

KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle.

KAMEN
I'll stick with my own.

He sits with her and stares into the darkness.

HIROKO
Any luck raising Ackland's party?

KAMEN
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain 
range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.

HIROKO
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.

KAMEN
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?

HIROKO
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.

HIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
This whole thing's got me spooked.

KAMEN hops off the wheel.

KAMEN
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone 
figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look-
see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find 
whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.

HIROKO
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?

KAMEN
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.

EXT.  SPACE

A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the 
incapacitated satellite, examining every section.  it comes to the rent 
torn through it, and pauses.

FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made 
up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.  The damage registers as a 
cold, black mass.

The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly 
on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet. 

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT

Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness.  
YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing.

ACKLAND
Found anything?

YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi-
purpose readout screen.

YORK
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.

ACKLAND
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!

ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.

YORK
What is it?

ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the 
rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground.

ACKLAND
It's a rhino.

YORK
Is it dead?

ACKLAND
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your 
stick's not broken.

YORK looks at the data-stick again.

YORK
Yeah, it's fine.

ACKLAND
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.

YORK
I told you we... what's that?

Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape.

ACKLAND
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?

YORK
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.

ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.

YORK (CONT'D)
Careful...

There's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed.

ACKLAND
It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree 
with him.

A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a 
BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair.

YORK
Let's get back and call this in.

ACKLAND
Wait a minute.

YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing 
foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to 
partially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over 
something at the bottom of the shallow pit.

YORK
What is that... is that metal fragments?

ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.

ACKLAND
This is very fucking weird.

He sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the 
broken foliage.

ACKLAND (CONT'D)
It's like something came out of the crater and went that way...

There's a TINY CLICK, and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the 
safety off his rifle.  ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too.  They 
step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to...

YORK
Another one?

ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun.

ACKLAND
Yeah.  This's closed.

There's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in 
four sections.  The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS 
nervously. Something organic is pulsing inside.  ACKLAND cranes his 
neck forward for a better look...

There's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT.  A spindly shape with a long 
segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND.  It's a 
FACEHUGGER.  ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance.  His finger 
involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls.  A volley 
of shots describe and arc and  light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE 
BOOM, and we...

CUT TO
...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.  SOMETHING is watching them 
from the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V.  A PREDATOR.  We 
see the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi-
colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER, 
before we... 

CUT BACK TO
...One of ACKLAND's bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORK's thigh as 
he races forward to help his friend.  The HUGGER's tail is already 
around ACKLAND's throat, it's fingers scrabbling for purchase.  YORK 
pulls at one set of digits, and manages to raise them for just an 
instant.  What we see is horrific; the look of terror on ACKLAND's 
face, and the questing tendril on
the HUGGER's underside trying to force it's way between ACKLAND's lips.  
In a second, it's all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK's 
grasp, and clamps itself firmly on ACKLAND's face with a faint SUCKING 
SOUND.  YORK shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few 
feet away.  He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving 
altogether.

YORK
Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.

The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as 
YORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we...

CUT TO
A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging 
ACKLAND's body away from the crater.  It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, 
giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around 
the HUGGER and into ACKLAND.

YORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue 
trousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling 
him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely.  There's movement on 
the ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to 
another FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body.  The HUGGER's 
fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the 
movement akin to somebody drumming their
fingers on a table-top.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT

As YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes, he hears a TICKING SOUND 
from the trees, like an engine cooling on a warm summer's day.  YORK 
clutches his rifle and stares upward.  There seems to be a VAGUE 
SHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree.  Although it might be a trick 
of the light, he isn't sticking around to find out.  YORK guns the bike 
to life and ROARS off above the swamp.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT

PREDATOR-VISION.  
We're looking at the site in colours:  the cold blue of empty ALIEN 
EGGS, and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the 
FACEHUGGER parasites.

A group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity, their 
camouflage cloaks deactivated.  The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to 
the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE 
curled up there.  Most of it has been madly mutilated by something 
erupting from inside it's body. The PREDATOR looks up and scans the 
swamp, ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
This time, an oscillating line appears to the left of our view, and a 
band sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing 
different levels of SOUND STATIC.  This abruptly stops as the 
oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys.  The PREDATOR is 
picking up radio
waves.  A HUMAN VOICE; albeit grossly-distorted.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

We hear a RAPID BEEPING; movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn 
against intruding animals.  The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent, 
bleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol.  She's suddenly wide awake 
when she sees YORK's hover-bike, lit by the sensors' flashing red 
strobe.  It skids to a halt against a mud-bank, sending up a spray of 
silt.  YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles, then starts to unfasten 
the straps holding ACKLAND's body.

BEAUVAIS
Jesus Christ!  What happened?

YORK
Give me a hand with Ack.

She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.

BEAUVAIS
How bad is... oh my God.

As ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a 
FACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed. 

BEAUVAIS
What is that?

YORK
Don't... uuh... don't know.  Help me... uuh... help me get him inside.  
Shit!

YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful.  He slumps 
slowly to the floor.

BEAUVAIS   (yelling)
Minh!  Minh, get out here!

INT.  TENT - NIGHT

A portable neon light in the tent flickers, casting staccato bluish 
light over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER.  MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it 
in horrified fascination, while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his 
thigh.  He winces. 

BEAUVAIS
Have you tried prising it off?

YORK shakes his head.

YORK
I wanted to get him back here; get him back to base.

MINH
Forget it.  We lost the satellite link. It's dead.

There's a long pause while everyone considers the options.

BEAUVAIS
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.

MINH
Oh man...

YORK
Get real, Beauvais!  That thing might chew his fucking face off for all 
be know!

The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.  MINH catches BEAUVAIS' 
head-jerk.

BEAUVAIS
Minh...

MINH
Yep...

MINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.  BEAUVAIS rounds on 
YORK, continuing.

BEAUVAIS
How do you know it's not already?

YORK
I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look...

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

MINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of 
the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.  He 
studies the surrounding darkness.  There's nothing out there.  He 
shakes his head in 
disgust.

MINH   (muttering)
Take a goddamn wrench to those things...

He thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.  There's a gentle WHINE, 
and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the 
weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a 
target.  We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.  In addition to the firing 
trigger, there's also a thumb button.  He squeezes it...

The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking 
something automatically.  There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off 
three shots in rapid succession.  Something that was only yards from 
MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a 
mass of luminous green liquid and motion.

MINH (CONT'D)  (dumbstruck)
God.

MINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a 
SPLASH, then lie motionless.  YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in 
an instant.

PREDATOR-VISION. 
Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.  The triangular mechanism of the 
PREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH.

A BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body, 
spraying blood across YORK.  He topples dead to the ground, a look of 
pained surprise on his face.  BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing 
across and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.  She doesn't have time to 
take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger 
guard and starts squeezing off random shots.  The air shimmers as an 
unseen shape races at her.  There's a loud

SWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air.  
It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and 
impaling her against a tree.

YORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.  A moment later 
her struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken 
marionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS 
disappears.  In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch 
trickling from a wound on it's arm.  It's head flicks around as it 
zeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon 
following suit.  YORK's quick though, already up and running when the 
plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg.

His options are limited.  The hover-bike is nearby.  He sprints for 
that and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.  He flips 
it.  The engine COUGHS and then dies.  YORK looks up.  The wounded 
PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.  YORK turns 
the key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.  The creature WHIPS 
an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE 
ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!  The blade 
slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta-
wings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into 
the swamp.

YORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the 
rear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.  He sees a PREDATOR 
handing from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their 
camouflage nearby.  He's not sticking around to argue though.  YORK 
jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more 
cannon-blasts blossom around him.

The group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the 
area. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses 
to the tent and opens the entry flap.

INT.  TENT - NIGHT

PREDATOR-VISION. 
The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on 
ACKLAND for a long moment, but takes no further action.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

We PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite.  There isn't a soul there, 
human or otherwise.  The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs. 

EXT.  RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN

First light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon.  A 'chopper' - 
actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist 
hanging over the treetops.

INT.  CHOPPER - DAWN

The cockpit is small, a two-seater with room for cargo in the back.  
KAMEN's in the pilot seat, and HIROKO's riding shotgun.  The controls 
moving by themselves, on autopilot.  A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN 
to look up from his magazine.

KAMEN'S P.O.V.
From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of 
the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees.

KAMEN nudges HIROKO awake.

KAMEN
Wake up.  We're at the beacon.

He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down.  
HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep 
across the clearing.  The encampment has been wrecked, much of is 
reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris.  All-terrain gear lowers 
from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp.

INT.  CHOPPER - DAWN

KAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief.  KAMEN hauls an 
automatic pulse-rifle from the rear. 

KAMEN
Looks like trouble.

KAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol.  
Passes it to her.

KAMEN (CONT'D)
Used one of these before?

HIROKO coolly examines it.

HIROKO
Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses twelve mill hollow 'O' 
rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can 
handle this.

HIROKO's show-boating and KAMEN knows it, but he still can't help being 
a little bit impressed.

KAMEN
Okay.  Watch were you point it...

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

The two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred 
canvas. Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has 
burned through.

HIROKO   (quietly)
Somebody picked an argument.

KAMEN
Yeah.  Somebody won.

HIROKO
Check out the tent.

KAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the 
wreckage dotted around the perimeter.

INT.  TENT - DAWN

KAMEN opens the tent flap and peers inside.  ACKLAND's on the cot, 
sweating heavily.  There is no sign of the FACEHUGGER.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Across the clearing, HIROKO turns a piece of charred plating over in 
her hands before discarding it.

Her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud.  It's MINH's 
'howitzer'. A dark slippery patch coats the metal.  She crouches down 
and rubs her fingers through it.  Blood.  KAMEN's VOICE intrudes, O.S.

KAMEN   (O.S.)
I've found Ackland!

HIROKO
Hold on...

She begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of 
rope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the 
face and knocking her off her feet.  HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and 
surprise, then freezes at what she sees.

Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS 
and MINH.  Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition.  KAMEN 
hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant.  He stops 
in his tracks.

KAMEN
Jesus palomino...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING

It's raining again at the base.  Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO 
watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic 
trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late 
thirties.  As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO 
has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat.  KAMEN runs after 
REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag.

KAMEN
Wait a minute, Doc...

He hands the bag over to REVNA.  She peers at the contents curiously.  
The FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled. 

REVNA
Is this it?

KAMEN
Yeah.  Found it curled up in a corner of the tent.  Any idea?

REVNA shakes her head.

REVNA
Never come across one of these before. Maybe the original survey team 
did.  I'll run it through records and see what comes up.

GUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLAND's body's secure on the trolley.  KAMEN 
raps him on the back to get his attention.

KAMEN
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.

GUTTIEREZ
What's the problem?

KAMEN
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines 
might be playing up.

GUTTIEREZ
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.

KAMEN
Appreciate that.

REVNA interrupts.

REVNA
Where're the bodies?

HIROKO
Bagged and in the back.  They're not a pretty sight.

ACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator.  As KAMEN and HIROKO walk 
away across the rain-swept platform, a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself 
from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad. 

PREDATOR-VISION.
A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the towers and modules of the relay-
station with great interest.  An oscillating red line appears to the 
LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR analyses HIROKO's voice-pattern.

PREDATOR   (O.S., distorted)
Not a pretty sight.  Not a pretty sight...

He reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DAY

Under the cathedral-like light filtering through the trees above, a row 
of metal spikes have been driven into the earth.  Four are topped with 
still-smoking ALIEN skulls.  Two and empty.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
A newly decapitated ALIEN head is turned around in another PREDATOR's 
hands in admiration.  This PREDATOR thrusts his trophy onto the next 
spike, then stares at the vacant one for a long moment.  His wrist 
computer BLEEPS for attention...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

With nothing to do, most of the screens are out and the remaining 
personnel bored.  PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the 
console, uninterested in HIROKO and KAMEN's conversation nearby. 

HIROKO
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with 
something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.

KAMEN
Agreed.

HIROKO
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.

KAMEN
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right 
now.

HIROKO
What do you mean?

URIOSTE walks up, very serious.  She interrupts.

URIOSTE
Sorry.  Can I have a word?

HIROKO
Sure.  What's up?

URIOSTE
Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago.  The algae must have clogged up an 
intake duct.

KAMEN
Think I spoke too soon...

HIROKO
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

URIOSTE
I reckon it'll be another day before the smell gets unbearable.  
Beauvais usually fixes it, but... ah...

HIROKO knows what she means.  BEAUVAIS is dead.

HIROKO
Can you handle it?

URIOSTE
Sure, I can manage.  But I'm not going into the Pit on my own.

HIROKO   (to Urioste)
Alright, get somebody from the auto-shop.   (to Kamen)   Is that 
alright?

KAMEN
Yeah, no problem.  Ask Diller, he's good with his hands.

URIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE.

CASSIE
I'll go along with that.

A SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up 
to answer.

PARSONS
Parsons.   (long beat)   Yeah.  Hold on.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY

A CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.  DOC REVNA's shining a 
hand- held light into ACKLAND's face.  ACKLAND's regained 
consciousness, but is far from happy.  He's sitting on the edge of a 
cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical 
equipment.  The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a 
circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting 
blades and surgical paraphernalia.

ACKLAND
Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.  Really.

REVNA flicks off the probe.

REVNA
Headache?  Dehydration?

ACKLAND
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

REVNA
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours.  
I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.

REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN.

REVNA (CONT'D)
He's broken a fever that would kill a mule, but if he says he's alright 
I'm prepared to believe him.  He's all yours.

HIROKO enters.  She watches from behind KAMEN.

KAMEN
What happened out there, Ack?

ACKLAND   (consternated)
What do you mean, 'what happened'?  What am I doing back here?  Where's 
York?

HIROKO   (insistent)
What's the last thing you can remember?

ACKLAND thinks hard.

ACKLAND
We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's.

HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances.

HIROKO
A meteor?

ACKLAND
Yeah, it impacted really off.  We went out to the crash-site... and... 
uh... that's... that's all.

KAMEN
Nothing else?

ACKLAND
No.

KAMEN turns to REVNA.

KAMEN
Show him 'Fido'.

REVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack.  She 
hands it to ACKLAND.  He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside 
with morbid fascination.

REVNA
Ring any bells?

ACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard 
on his mind.

ACKLAND
Not really, no.  Ugly little sonuvabitch. What is it?

KAMEN
We thought you might be able to tell us. I found it by your cot at the 
camp.  You were out cold.

ACKLAND
What did York say?

HIROKO
York's vanished.

ACKLAND
Vanished?

HIROKO
Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland.  York's gone awol, unless you can 
help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime 
suspect right now.

The news hits ACKLAND hard.  He falters and leans back, addressing 
REVNA.

ACKLAND
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?

REVNA
Sure.

She goes to fetch a cup.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMISSARY

It's lunchtime, and the SOUND of machinery STEAMING food mixes with the 
CHATTER of the twenty-or-so personnel eating there.  HIROKO and KAMEN 
are deep in conversation across a table.

KAMEN
Do you believe him?

HIROKO
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on 
Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure.  
There's not much we can do out here.

KAMEN stares hard at her.  That's not much of an answer, and HIROKO 
knows it. She capitulates.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Alright then, For what it's worth... yes, I do.

KAMEN digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork.

KAMEN
You should try this seasoned stuff.  It's good.

GUTTIEREZ approaches the table carrying something.

GUTTIEREZ
Got a present for you.

He hands HIROKO's leather jacket over to her.

HIROKO
Oh, I've been looking for this!  Where was it?

GUTTIEREZ
You left it in the chopper.  Oh, and before I forget, Don?  I ran that 
test you wanted on the turbines.

KAMEN
And...?

GUTTIEREZ
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON

A metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform.  DILLER leans 
against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly 
blowing rings into the air.  BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to 
quietly SNARL.  DILLER glances down at her curiously.

DILLER
What's the matter, girl?  You smell something?

Now the rhino are restless too.  CASSIE walks across the concrete 
roadway to join them.

CASSIE
Rhinos look a little antsy,

BREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING.

DILLER
Yeah.  Never seem 'em act like this before.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
CASSIE and DILLER are 'warm', but the rhinos are BREWSTER are 'hotter' 
still.  Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of 
unrecognizability, eerily distorted.

CASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND.

CASSIE
Do you hear that?

DILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.  It's a 
FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second.

DILLER
Yeah...

A hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as 
it hurtles towards the base.  Halfway between the trees and the ramp, 
it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.  It's rider flies through 
the air and hits the swamp face-first.  DILLER and CASSIE race down the 
ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead.

CASSIE
I don't believe it.

DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the 
mire. It's YORK.  Blood has caked around his wounded leg.

DILLER
He looks in a bad way.  Help me get him up to Infirmary.

CASSIE
Wait a minute...

Something else has caught CASSIE's eye.  A "something" almost two 
metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike.  
Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free.  CASSIE examines the 
PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head.

CASSIE (CONT'D)
Holy Mary...

PREDATOR-VISION.
The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the 
weapon over in her hands.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY

REVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.  Every so often she 
GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal.  
The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of 
the computer screen.  The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle 
THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.  ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably 
on his cot.  He finally sits up and massages his chest.

ACKLAND
Oh.  Oh God...

REVNA lowers her pen and looks across.

REVNA
What is it?

ACKLAND
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.

REVNA
Do you want a tablet?

ACKLAND winces in pain.  His breathing's getting heavy.  He nods.

ACKLAND
Uh-huh.

REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.  ACKLAND's 
beginning to COUGH now.

REVNA
That sounds nasty.  I'll give you a couple of Demazine.

ACKLAND nods again.  His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging 
his chest with a balled fist.  REVNA hurries over with three red 
tablets and a disposable cup of water.  ACKLAND takes them gratefully 
and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens 
and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips.

REVNA (CONT'D)
Better?

ACKLAND
Yeah...

Before he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.  A thin 
spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her 
cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to 
hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the 
process.  He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume.

REVNA
Hold on, it's alright.  I'm gonna give  you a shot...

Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical 
instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a 
vial of amber liquid attached.  ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto 
the floor, his hands clawing at the air.  REVNA fumbles with the 
injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.  ACKLAND 
convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the 
ceiling.  The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again.

We hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.  REVNA watches in 
horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across 
the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.  REVNA shudders as the body 
moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it.

WHAT SHE SEES.  ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, 
revealing a gaping cavity in his back.  Bits of spine and ribcage are 
just visible.  A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform 
- pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of 
still-underdeveloped arms.

Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.  It kicks away from 
ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance.  
After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a 
table.  REVNA thinks quickly.  She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red 
stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed.

The room is bathed in pools of shadows.  Plenty of hiding space for the 
creature.  REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.  She 
cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of 
probe-arms. 

There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery.  
REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.  Now she's 
armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER...

There's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the 
hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL 
SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.  We 
hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR

HIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.  DILLER, 
CASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.  YORK lays 
unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making 
access difficult.  Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open 
revealing a circular mechanism beneath.  BREWSTER scratches at the 
bulkhead and WHINES.  MUFFLED THUMPS come from within.

HIROKO
What happened?

DILLER
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.

HIROKO   (astonished)
York...

HIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from 
within the Infirmary distracts her.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
What's going on?

CASSIE
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds 
like Ackland's going nuts.

HIROKO
Force the door.

DILLER
Can't.  It's pressure sealed.

GUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip.

GUTTIEREZ
Here...

DILLER
Thanks.

He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical 
effort showing on his face.  The door grinds open about eight inches... 

The bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap, HISSING 
vehemently.  Yellow fluid wells from a wound in it's crested skull, 
dissolving everything it comes into contact with.  The small group 
gathered around fall back in panic, jarring YORK's trolley and knocking 
HIROKO to the floor.  BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER, which tenses 
as if to leap.
DILLER brings the wrench down, but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and 
takes flight.  It strikes at HIROKO, who reflexively draws her head 
back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek.  
The ALIEN disappears down the corridor, leaving a trail of smeared 
blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring.  
GUTTIEREZ bends down and
helps HIROKO to her feet.  Shocked, she MUTTERS something to herself in 
JAPANESE, and regains some of her composure.

HIROKO
Get after it, don't let it get away!

DILLER stands there with the metal bar.  Does she think he's nuts?

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Go on!

This galvanises DILLER.  He races off in pursuit.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jan, give me a hand over here.

HIROKO AND GUTTIEREZ try to force the door, but DILLER was right - it 
won't budge.  HIROKO slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around 
blindly.  She must have hit the control knob, because the door slides 
back.  CASSIE looks inside.

CASSIE
Oh my God...

She turns away and retches.  HIROKO steps through and goes pale.  There 
are blood-smears over everything, and it's all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop 
BREWSTER from getting in there.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS' finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics 
displayed on a suspended glass screen.

PARSONS
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...

HIROKO
What is that?

DILLER
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating 
ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.

HIROKO
Where does that lead to?

PARSONS
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed 
out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked-
out.

HIROKO
You've checked that end?

GUTTIEREZ
Not yet, no.

HIROKO
Do it.  I don't want that thing on my installation.  I want it caught 
and destroyed.

KAMEN
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is 
basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off 
external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, 
we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That 
should give us ample time to find it.

HIROKO
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign 
a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it 
on the board.

CASSIE nods soberly.  HIROKO looks at everybody, and her words are 
carefully chosen.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
I don't care how you kill this thing, just be careful not to get in 
it's way when it bleeds.  You all saw what happened to Doc Revna.

There are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs.  
Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down 
with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.

DILLER
Okay.

HIROKO
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in 
itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a 
hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.

This seems to appeal to those assembled there.  There's a palpable buzz 
in the air.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Alright, let's get to it.  New York rules apply.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

YORK is recounting his story to KAMEN and HIROKO in a hushed voice.  
Small beads of sweat stand out on his forehead and his eyes are haunted 
by remembrance.  The man's a mess.

YORK
...I mean, these... these mothers were... were huge.  They look like 
bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em.  
They must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.  Minh got 
off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as well 
have been using a B-B gun.  I don't know how the hell I made it out of 
there alive.

He nods toward the PREDATOR spear in HIROKO's hands.

YORK (CONT'D)
The one I clipped with the hoverbike shoved that at me.  Whatever it's 
made of, it went straight through a double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy 
composite like it was butter.

YORK shakes his head in fear.

YORK (CONT'D)
I don't wanna ever come up against those things again.  Ever.

KAMEN claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him.

KAMEN
Don't worry about it, Yorkie.  You're safe now.  Go get come rest.

YORK nods.  He gets to his feet and leaves the room.  HIROKO waits 
until the door slides shut behind him.

HIROKO
So, what do you think?

KAMEN
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift 
their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the 
middle of something we shouldn't.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

It's late, and the base's exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light 
across the metal and concrete thoroughfares.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES - 
a tough-looking Afrikaan woman with a think accent - looks uneasily 
about them. Another GROUP of PEOPLE with trackers and guns are 
searching around in the BACKGROUND.  Nearby, the vertical yellow column 
of a suspension-crane gantry towers high above.

DE VRIES
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.

GUTTIEREZ
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more 
fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, 
and found zip.

DE VRIES
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?

GUTTIEREZ
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.

DE VRIES pauses, listening to the sound from the surrounding forest.

DE VRIES
Listen to that...

GUTTIEREZ cocks his head and listens.  He has no idea what she means.

GUTTIEREZ
Listen to what?

DE VRIES
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's 
unnatural.

GUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable 
blackness beyond the confines of the base.

GUTTIEREZ
De Vries?

DE VRIES
Yeah?

GUTTIEREZ
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.

BREWSTER the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the 
meshwork fence of their pens.  The animals move around in agitation.  
Not at her, but at something else...

DE VRIES
Something spooking the rhinos?

GUTTIEREZ
I dunno.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - DUSK

PREDATOR-VISION. 
The rhino's, the dog, and the two humans can be seen way above on the 
platform's edge, bright red.

Indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks, the small group of PREDATORS 
wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DARKNESS.  DILLER and URIOSTE's VOICES heard O.S. in HUSHED TONES.  The 
scraping of METAL-ON-METAL.

DILLER
What is that...is that it?

URIOSTE
No.  I... think that's a regulator valve. Hold on.

There's more NOISE.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Ah, got it...!

About a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber 
illuminate.  Three others flicker erratically, one of them remaining 
unlit. DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse-
rifle level. He enters, followed by URIOSTE.  She's carrying a portable 
- but bulky - piece of machinery.

URIOSTE
Are you getting anything?

DILLER   (sarcastic)
Yeah, eyestrain.  What's with the lights?

URIOSTE
They're always like that.  Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to 
spares.  Wave that thing in the corner...

DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around.  The small screen registers 
nothing.

DILLER
The room's clean.

URIOSTE
Great.

URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the 
floor.  It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. 
Below it is what looks like a round metal plug.  Recessed into its 
surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on 
either side.  She turns the lever.  There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume 
of steam JETS out of the valve.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Give me a hand with this.

GRUNTING, the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit.  
Murky water sloshes around below.  URIOSTE pulls a second lever, and 
hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Pass me over that tripod, will you?

Leaning against the wall behind DILLER is a sturdy metal tripod topped 
with a block-and-tackle arrangement.  A hook dangles below this, it's 
thick metal cabling going up through the block-and-tackle and 
connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to 
the wall.  DILLER hands the tripod over to URIOSTE.  She splays the 
legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open 
pit.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES walk over to the rhino pen, BREWSTER pulling at 
her leash.  GUTTIEREZ frowns at what he sees.  All the rhinos are 
nervously huddled together in the far corner.

GUTTIEREZ
That's real peculiar behavior.

DE VRIES fingers a rough metal edge.

DE VRIES
Hey, Guttierez?

GUTTIEREZ
What?

DE VRIES
Take a look at this.

GUTTIEREZ moves over for a closer look.  There's a torn hole in the 
meshwork, just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through.  Blood and 
fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap.

GUTTIEREZ
One of 'em must have escaped.

DE VRIES
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking 
tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it 
up.

GUTTIEREZ shines the flashlight along the deck.  A trail of smeared 
blood runs all the way to the perimeter.  The surrounding fence has 
been buckled and twisted.  They cross to it and look down at the swamp.  
The torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below.

GUTTIEREZ
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.

DE VRIES
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.

GUTTIEREZ
That's a fact.

GUTTIEREZ' tracker starts to BLEEP.  He raises it excitedly.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Whoa, wait a minute...

DE VRIES
What?

GUTTIEREZ
Just got a reading...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Most of the lights in Admin are off, and the room's deserted.  PARSONS 
is seated away from his usual station at a console topped by ten 
monitor screens, each displaying a securi-cam picture.  He looks tired.  
KAMEN comes up behind him carrying two mugs of coffee.

KAMEN
How's it going?

PARSONS
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

He takes the coffee gratefully and sips at it.

PARSONS (CONT'D)
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now.  
Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.

KAMEN
You should hit the sack, too.

PARSONS
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.

KAMEN
What time's sundown?

PARSONS
'Bout five minutes.

KAMEN
Give me a yell is something happens.

PARSONS
You got it, cowboy.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ sweeps the tracker slowly around, and BREWSTER begins to 
gently SNARL.  
DE VRIES pulls on the dog's leash to quieten her.

GUTTIEREZ
It's up there somewhere...

He shoulders his rifle.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Come on.

A metal ladder runs up the side of one of the base buildings.  
GUTTIEREZ crosses to it and starts to climb the first few rungs.

DE VRIES
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?

GUTTIEREZ
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.

DE VRIES
Forget it, man.

GUTTIEREZ
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.

DE VRIES
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if 
it wasn't night.

GUTTIEREZ starts to climb the ladder.

DE VRIES
What the hell are you doing?

GUTTIEREZ
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.

DE VRIES runs her fingers through her hair in frustration.  Comes to a 
decision counter to what she wants to do...

DE VRIES
Wait a minute!

GUTTIEREZ stops climbing.

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
Alright, okay.  Look...

GUTTIEREZ
What?

DE VRIES
I'll come with you.

BREWSTER BARKS.  She drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties 
the leash around it.

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
But I'm going first...

GUTTIEREZ
Anything you say, Mammacitta.

She climbs around GUTTIEREZ and begins to ascend the ladder.  BREWSTER 
WHIMPERS and plaintively BARKS after them.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

The rooftop is dark, mysterious.  Pieces of retrofitted junk can be 
seen in silhouette, edged in light from way below.  DE VRIES and 
GUTTIEREZ carefully step over the threshold.  They speak in WHISPERS.

DE VRIES
Careful of that edging there...

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah, I got it.

Although we have an outstanding VIEW of the night lights of the base up 
here, the immediate gloom is impenetrable. 

DE VRIES
Where's that flashlight?

By way of an answer, a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air.  DE 
VRIES takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground.  Circular 
extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom.

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
Still got him?

GUTTIEREZ
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.

DE VRIES plays the flashlight across the rooftop.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Little bit further...

The beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus.  A short-
range antennae, about seven feet wide.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right there, right behind the antennae.  I think 
we're got it cornered...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with 
the roadway.  The broken grillework is melted outwards.  KAMEN and two 
other men - CALDWELL and THOMAS - stand behind.

THOMAS
The door to the food storage locker was smashed open.  It must have 
come straight out of here.

HIROKO yawns.

HIROKO
Alright.  Keep your eyes peeled.

She voices her concern to KAMEN.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
If it got out of the systems, it could be anywhere.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

It's very quiet, and we can hear the NERVOUS BREATHING of GUTTIEREZ and 
DE VRIES as they cautiously stalk forward.

GUTTIEREZ
Hold it, hold it...

DE VRIES
What's wrong?

GUTTIEREZ
I'm picking up another signal.

DE VRIES looks around, unnerved.

DE VRIES
What?  Where?

GUTTIEREZ
Just behind us, over to the right.

DE VRIES shines her beam over the surface of the yellow crane to their 
rear, shifting her attention to-and-fro from it and the antennae.

DE VRIES
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah, I...

The second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Wait.  Lost it.

DE VRIES
How?

GUTTIEREZ
I dunno.  Might be a glitch.

From behind the metal disc there comes a SHUFFLING SOUND, followed by a 
METALLIC THUNK.  This gets their attention.  The two of them halt in 
their tracks.

DE VRIES
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!

GUTTIEREZ
It's alright, it's cool...

DE VRIES
Is it still moving?

GUTTIEREZ
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe.  
Nice and easy...

A small many-limbed SHAPE hurls itself from the confines of it's hiding 
place with a FERAL SHRIEK.  DE VRIES YELPS in surprise, and looses off 
a spray of bullets.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO looks up, startled by the sound of GUNFIRE.  She sees the 
rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire.  BREWSTER's 
tethered nearby, BARKING furiously.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

A think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends URIOSTE in 
the gloom of the Pump Shaft.  In front of her is a machine-part we saw 
her carry earlier.  With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her 
mouth, she's just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of 
machinery in an alcove, with simultaneously doing her best not to touch 
the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge.

The REPORT of DE VRIES' weapon can be heard even down here, perhaps 
more startling in the confined space.  URIOSTE jumps, dropping the 
flashlight into the water in the process.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access 
tunnel leading outside.  URIOSTE's VOICE floats up out of the shaft. 

URIOSTE   (O.S., muffled)
What was that?

DILLER   (raising his voice)
Something outside...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

The wind whips at GUTTIEREZ as he blinks away his shock.

GUTTIEREZ
Holy shit...

DE VRIES keeps her torch beam on the moving shape.  It halts by the 
edge of the roof, and stares at them.

DE VRIES
Oh, nice going, man!  It was a lemur! A goddamn lemur!

GUTTIEREZ' radio headset CRACKLES to life.

HIROKO   (O.S., on headset)
Guttierez, what the hell's going on up there?

GUTTIEREZ
Uh... sorry about that, boss.  Everything's fine.  False alarm, that's 
all.

DE VRIES glances around the rooftop, annoyed.

DE VRIES
Hey, look; let's forget it.  There's nothing up here.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing brightly.  Her VOICE replayed and 
distorted.

PREDATOR   (O.S.)
Nothing up here.  Nothing up here.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

URIOSTE's flashlight bobs up-and-down on the water below, still lit and 
well out of reach.

URIOSTE    (disgustedly)
Shit.

DILLER   (O.S., muffled)
What's the matter?

URIOSTE
I've dropped my torch into the water. Give me about... uh... a meter-
and-a-half's worth of slack.

DILLER   (O.S., muffled)
Okay.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch.  On the mechanism's side is a 
luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.  He 
pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from "8" to "9.5" 
as the cable feeds out.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

URIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls.  
Her feet almost tread water.  She's down as far as she can go.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Whoa, whoa...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

URIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)  (O.S., muffled)
That's enough.

DILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.  The WHINE 
of the cable-feed stops immediately.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

URIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers.  
It's... just... about... in... reach...

Six slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp 
like a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.  A sleek eyeless head follows, 
trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.  A SCREAM 
forms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps 
firmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.  He sees the 
winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an 
angler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps 
from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening 
rate.  The digital counter flickers rapidly; 
"11...11.5...12...12.5...13..."  DILLER watches the tripod's tubular 
legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.  He scrambles for 
the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the 
over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the 
shaft's edge.  DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the 
deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by 
the colossal force from below.  He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy 
piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.  Watches it disappear 
noisily into the conduit.

DILLER
Annie!

DILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight.

DILLER (CONT'D)
Annie!

He feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness.

WHAT HE SEES.  The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the 
ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft 
walls towards him.  Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door.  
Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, 
grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.  DILLER fumbles with the 
safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it 
back into the pit.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below.

GUTTIEREZ
The hell was that?

PREDATOR-VISION.  
The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the 
platform below.  He watches the infra-red shapes of other people 
running towards the source of the shots...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER 
ALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.  He races across the 
threshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

In a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow 
catwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead.  
DILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides 
with him. 

KAMEN
Kev, wha...?

DILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.  He looks as if he's about 
to say something, but never gets the chance.

There's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express 
train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

PREDATOR-VISION.  
Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black 
SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans...

From the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.  She 
violently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that 
barges past them, launching itself from the rooftop. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed 
to his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam. 

PARSONS
Oh my God...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

With superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, 
splintering his skull and killing him instantly.  His body caromes into 
THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.  The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's 
questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the 
ground.  The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people 
it's impossible to get a clean 
shot...

HIROKO
Move!  Get out of the way!

HIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.  She flips off the safety on her 
rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger.  
It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying.  
CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.  It 
strikes like a snake. Once.  Twice.  The stinger punctures CALDWELL's 
chest and throat.  Nobody could survive something like that...

The ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.  The man's head is 
inches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth 
open...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike...

WHOOMPH.  Something lands heavily close-up, jarring the catwalk.  The 
ALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS.  A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM 
appears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIEN's midriff, spraying acidic 
fluid.  The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around, it's 
ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant.  The STINGER 
makes contact:  there's a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATOR's cloaking 
device begins to flicker spasmodically, giving us peek-a-boo glimpses 
of it's natural form.  Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATOR's 
ruin wrist-computer, luminous green blood welling from a wound in his 
arm...

From out of the Pump Room comes more NOISE, like metal being trashed in 
a compactor.  HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to 
the door panel.

HIROKO
Get the door!

KAMEN hastily slaps the 'close' button and both halves of the exterior 
pressure bulkhead RUMBLE together.  A SECOND ALIEN appears from the 
shadows within and prises it's fingers into the dwindling gap, 
struggling for purchase.  Despite the ALIEN's best efforts, the door 
motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid 
CLUNK.  MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side.

Nearby, THOMAS has retrieved CALDWELL's weapon in the heat of the fight 
and is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR.  At the last possible 
moment HIROKO sees what he's about to do...

HIROKO
No!

Reflexively, she knocks the barrel away as THOMAS looses a volley of 
shots.

PREDATOR-VISION. 
The PREDATOR's speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white-
hot bullets sear the night.

PREDATOR
No!

PREDATOR-VISION.  
SNAPPING IN for a closer look at her.

PREDATOR (CONT'D)
No!

One of the ALIEN's hands clamps firmly onto the PREDATOR's mask and 
wrenches it off.  HIROKO stares at the PREDATOR's face in fascination.  
From the distinctive features, we see that it's BROKEN TUSK.  The 
PREDATOR's good hand flashes down to his thigh, almost too quick to 
follow.  In one rapid movement a circular 'smart-weapon' is brought up, 
slicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from it's head.  In a feat of 
strength, the PREDATOR lifts his opponent's corpse on the end of the 
spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing...

Not wasting a second, BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of 
some twenty feet with astounding grace.  He grips a pipe running down 
the side of one of the building modules, then clambers over the roof's 
edge and finally disappears from view.  BREWSTER continues to BARK 
frenetically. 

HIROKO's headset has been knocked to the floor and a FRANTIC MUTED 
VOICE is coming from it.  She picks it up, and presses the 'transmit' 
switch. 

HIROKO   (into headset)
It's alright, Rob...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS listens to HIROKO, suddenly wide awake.  The morning shifts are 
starting to filter in, and it's obvious to them something's wrong...

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speaker)
Everything's under control.  Wait a second.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

THOMAS is moving from DILLER to CALDWELL, checking them for signs of 
life. HIROKO catches his eye.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Well?

THOMAS shakes his head.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES race across the 
platform to join the stunned survivors of the skirmish.  GUTTIEREZ 
bends down by DILLER's body.  THOMAS lays a hand on GUTTIEREZ' arm.

THOMAS
Come on, man.  Leave it alone.

GUTTIEREZ
Oh, God.  Dear Lord Jesus...

DE VRIES
This is like a bad dream, man.  A bad fucking dream.

HIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision.  She speaks into her 
radio headset.

HIROKO
Rob?  I want you to evac everybody from the non-connective modules into 
admin. That goes double for anybody...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO (CONT'D)  (O.S., on speaker)
...already out here.  We're going to lock every bulkhead and seal the 
base.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO turns her headset off and watches numerous rotating coloured 
lights dotted around the platform start to blink on-and-off.  KAMEN 
COUGHS a few more times.

HIROKO
Are you okay?

KAMEN rubs his throat.  He nods.

KAMEN
I'll survive.

BREWSTER's BARKS cease, replaced instead with a TERRIFIED LOW WHINING.

DE VRIES
What's with the dog?

GUTTIEREZ jogs over to BREWSTER.  Lowers his rifle to the ground and 
fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe.

GUTTIEREZ
Hey; c'mon now, girl.  It's alright.  Let's just get this knot 
undone...

A spray of plastic shards EXPLODES not three feet away from GUTTIEREZ.  
The rifle goes skittering away out of reach, and he scrambles away as 
an ALIEN half-pulls itself out of the sewer overflow, wet and 
glistening...

KAMEN
Jan!

BREWSTER's a mass of fur, totally out of control.  When the ALIEN 
lashes out to grab the HOWLING animal, there's nothing GUTTIEREZ can 
do.  BREWSTER's legs are the last thing we see, thrashing helplessly as 
she's dragged down into the splinter-edged gap.

DE VRIES
Get out of there, man!

THOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.  He races towards 
GUTTIEREZ, with 
DE VRIES close behind... 

THOMAS
Catch this!

From behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid 
limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.  THOMAS heaves the rifle 
over the heads of the emerging ALIENS.  Although GUTTIEREZ snags it 
awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures.

GUTTIEREZ
Chew on this!

DE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.  KAMEN glances 
down at this tracker's tiny screen.  It shows clusters of signals, lots 
of them.

KAMEN   (hollering)
They're all around, they're in the drainage system!

DE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging 
ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN.

GUTTIEREZ
Get your ass out of here, boss!

ALIENS are appearing everywhere.  From the overflow ducts; over the 
platform edges; along overhead cable supports.  Having taken on the 
genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid.  
All of them are living nightmares.

HIROKO
Oh my God...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS

CASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her 
tiny bathroom-cubicle.  A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the 
corridor outside.

CASSIE
Shit.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

THOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off.  As they race swiftly down 
the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.  A 
particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind 
them.  He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the 
outside of a module towards them.

GUTTIEREZ
De Vries!

DE VRIES' head turns.  She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid 
burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death 
throes. 

The group round the corner of a building.  Across the street from them 
is parked KAMEN's crawler.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Inside, inside!

They scramble up into the cab.  GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the 
driver's seat.  An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth.  
THOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign.

THOMAS
Yo' momma, boneface!

DE VRIES   (to Guttierez)
C'mon, man; punch this cow!

GUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.  They keys are there.  He flips 
them, and the engine GROWLS to life.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - DUSK

PREDATOR-VISION.
From way up here, we've got an outstanding view of the humans running 
across the platform...

Crouching on a bright-yellow catwalk, BROKEN TUSK presses closed a 
panel on the small container balanced on his knee.  Inside it are rows 
of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them.  
BROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.  Satisfied, he clips the 
medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet.

Standing around him are several other PREDATORS.  All but one have 
their camouflage cloaks activated.  The SOUND of GUNFIRE way across the 
station draws their attention...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO and KAMEN bolt towards an external hatch, with KAMEN laying down 
a field of covering fire on full-automatic.  The blaze of light from 
the rifle's barrel abruptly stops.

HIROKO
What?

KAMEN
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!

HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby.  A field of cows being 
slaughtered by machetes would sound like this.

HIROKO
They're in with the rhino!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK

An ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen, 
broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino.  It's 
yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED 
BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature.

ALIEN stingers slice through the air.  Rhinos try to bolt but are 
intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces.  It's wholesale carnage.

PREDATOR-VISION.
We're moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below, 
lessening the distance with each second...

Several indefinable FIGURES plunge into the fray, creating anarchy 
within the ALIENS' ranks.  The biomechanoids HISS with fury as the 
PREDATORS join battle against them...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

An ALIEN hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawler's 
roof.

INT.  CRAWLER - DUSK

KER-CHUNK!  The cab's occupants react as the thin roof buckles 
slightly. Skeletal fingers SLICE through, RIPPING at the metal like a 
can-opener.

DE VRIES
Jesus!

THOMAS raises his rifle and looses a fusillade of shots through the 
roof. One of them RICOCHETS off the interior, SHATTERING the 
windscreen.  There's a THUMP from outside...

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
You got 'im!

Their triumph is short-lived.  Globules of yellow acid perforate the 
roof like Swiss cheese, dripping down on them.  GUTTIEREZ floors the 
brakes.  The crawler swings through ninety degrees before SCREECHING to 
a halt. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE enters admin at a run.  Before, it was empty.  Now it's sheer 
chaos. She shoves her way through dozens of grim-faced people.  PARSONS 
is standing at a console, YELLING into his headset.

PARSONS
Seal everything now!

CASSIE
What's happening?

PARSONS
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.

CASSIE
We're what!?

York races in, SHOUTING above the clamor.

YORK
The son-of-bitches got into 'E' wing! They're ripping it apart!

PARSONS
Fuck!  Somebody get over there with some guns!  Now!

CASSIE watches the scene unfolding on the banks of monitors.  PEOPLE 
mouthing unheard words into camera.  Bursts of STATIC.  Fleeting 
glimpses of nightmarish SHAPES darting across the picture...

CASSIE
How many of them are there?

PARSONS
Too many.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ' group hurriedly exits the crawler.  A cloud of acrid smoke 
rapidly fills the cabin.

DE VRIES   (coughing)
Move it, man!

The dead ALIEN's corpse tumbles through the acid-eaten hole, falling 
into the cab's rear seat and promptly burning through that as well. Not 
far away across the platform, the massive doors to the auto-shop hanger 
are RUMBLING slowly closed...

GUTTIEREZ   (shouting)
Hold the doors, hold the doors!

They don't hear him.  The doors seal with a BOOM of finality.

DE VRIES
Over there, on the right!

THOMAS sees the two ALIENS nimbly climbing the platform's edge.  He 
squeezes off about five shots, managing to kill the FIRST ALIEN...

THOMAS
These bastards ain't so tough!

***************************

***** PAGE 70 MISSING *****

***************************

THOMAS looks concernedly at GUTTIEREZ.

THOMAS
Is that thing working?

GUTTIEREZ takes off the headset and scrutinises it closely.

GUTTIEREZ
Shit!  The casing's cracked!

DE VRIES rips her headset off and urgently passes it to him.

DE VRIES
Use mine.  Channel twenty-six.


EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

Despite their ferocity and weapons, it's clear that the small group of 
PREDATORS are being overrun by the ALIEN horde. 

BROKEN TUSK's shoulder cannon swivels automatically, blowing away 
another attacker.  Hearing a distinctive SCREAM, he looks across the 
platform.  One of the PREDATORS, it's camouflage cloak flickering 
intermittently, is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct.  
The two ALIENS in either side plunge their tail-stingers into the 
PREDATOR's body, making it CRY OUT in agony.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS

Pumped up with adrenalin, KAMEN reaches an intersection and encounters 
a harrowing tableau.  An ALIEN blocks his way on the other side of a 
corridor bulkhead, holding a STRUGGLING MAN above the floor.  It's 
piston-like tongue shoots into the MAN's skull, spraying gore.

The ALIEN sees KAMEN, and it's mouth twists into a bloody SNARL.  Both 
KAMEN and the ALIEN lunge forward together, but KAMEN's got the edge by 
a split-second.  He STRIKES a bright red switch and the overhead 
pressure bulkhead SLAMS down and locks into place.  His breathing is 
heavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

The two ALIENS THOMAS killed must have been the scout party.  Others 
appear, more cautiously this time...

DE VRIES
Hurry up and figure that thing out, man!

GUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic 
microswitches on the headset with his fingernails.

GUTTIEREZ
What?

THOMAS
We've got company!

THOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger.  He gets off 
one shot, then nothing more happens.  He looks at the counter on the 
side.  It reads 'zero'.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
Shit, I'm dry!  You're up!

DE VRIES raises her rifle.  She aims, and...

CLICK.

DE VRIES
I'm jammed!

THOMAS
You're what?!

She works the manual slide.

DE VRIES
It's locked solid...

THOMAS
Quick, give me the clip!

DE VRIES fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle.  It falls from her 
hands onto a plastic overflow grate.  THOMAS leaps after it...about a 
second too late.  It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
Oh, Lord!  Please, no!  Not now!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

HIROKO enters her office at a run.  She crosses to an inset control box 
on the far wall and presses a button.  Two exterior panels begin to 
slide closed behind the polycarbonate window.

KERSMASH!  Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes 
under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.  In shock, 
HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away.  
She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge 
outside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously 
raining repeated blows on the window with it's tail.

The ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the 
onslaught, showering splinters across the room.  The twin shutters 
secure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.  It 
HISSES in indignation and thrashes about.  Like a lizard, the segmented 
tail SNAPS in two.  The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining 
balance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden 
floorboards.  It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an 
unstoppable killing machine...

HIROKO
Holo on!

Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the 
computer can recognize it.  FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, 
forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.  The ALIEN halts, 
confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, 
bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them.

Gaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards 
the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.  The ALIEN locks in on this 
sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.  HIROKO 
GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength...

She's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does 
the job.  It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks 
there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.  HIROKO beats a hasty retreat 
as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged 
weapon...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS

HIROKO reels into the outside corridor.  She SHRIEKS as her shoulders 
are seized from behind...

KAMEN
Come on!

HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor.

HIROKO
That's the wrong way!

KAMEN
Detour.  Other way's blocked...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

Back outside, the ALIENS have sensed that something's amiss.  DE VRIES 
turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ.

DE VRIES
You got any slugs left?

GUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon.

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah.  Uh...

DE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder.  GUTTIEREZ completes his 
sentence.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
...Seven.

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  DE VRIES tries to make each shot count.  She 
sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical 
storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires...

A molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity 
into a blazing inferno.  The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, 
remaining immobile as it hits the deck.  A curtain of fire ripples 
across the platform...

THOMAS
Yes!

Their victory is short-lived.  The other ALIENS crawl cautiously 
forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.  We can 
clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws.

DE VRIES
Try again, man...

The headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct 
channel. He YELLS into it...

GUTTIEREZ
Matt!  Open these damn doors right now, I'll ream your ass so bad these 
things out here'll seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison!  Swear to 
God!

THOMAS turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal.

THOMAS
Open the doors!  Open the goddamned fucking doors!

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  CLICK.  GUTTIEREZ' bullets are gone.

DE VRIES
That's it!  We're dead!

The first of the ALIENS rushes at them.  This is the end.  DE VRIES 
SCREAMS...

There's a blinding flash, and most of the ALIEN's head vaporises.  
GUTTIEREZ blinks is disbelief as hazy SHAPES comprised of refracted 
fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the HUMAN and ALIEN 
antagonists.  Intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi-
tech PREDATOR weaponry far in advance of the humans' sears the air...

GUTTIEREZ turns at the SOUND of the huge metal doors GRINDING slowly 
open. Just enough for them to get through.

GUTTIEREZ
Move!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

THOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening, with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly 
following.

The Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one 
wall. The front of a crawler pokes from one of them, while in the 
center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on 
a hydraulic platform.  A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the 
doorway, brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms.  A blonde surfer-
type with long straggly
hair rushes over to them.  This is MATT, their savior.

MATT
Close it up, close it up!

GUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up.  
In the midst of the flames, the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle 
tooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents.  It's like a scene out of 
Hell.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS

Clusters of rotating emergency lights wig-wag above HIROKO and KAMEN as 
they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the Command 
Center.  KAMEN is falling behind as they approach a junction.

HIROKO
Hurry it up.

KAMEN
Don't wait for me!

HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command 
Center. Halfway down, KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from 
the rear.  The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently 
from beneath.

KAMEN
Run!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The PANDEMONIUM from the outside corridors gets the attention of YORK 
and everybody else in admin.  He crosses to the bulkhead doorframe, and 
what he sees makes his eyes bug.

YORK
Jesus Christ!

He SHOUTS back into the crowded room.

YORK (CONT'D)
They're inside, inside the corridor!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR

HIROKO and KAMEN try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken 
steel that emerges in their wake.  KAMEN YELLS with fright as an ALIEN 
claw pinions his ankle.  He trashes about, clutching at anything to 
prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor.  CRYING OUT is pain as 
slivers of edged metal slice into his hands...

HIROKO  (anguished)
No!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

YORK stands frozen at the bulkhead frame, staring down the corridor in 
horror.  CASSIE races up and pushes him out of the way...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR

HIROKO looks furiously around.  Spying an emergency axe in it's wall 
housing, she SMASHES the glass with her elbow, cutting herself in the 
process.  HIROKO hefts the heavy tool, swinging it down onto the 
disappearing ALIEN's carapace with all her might...

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Bastard!

The blade bites deep, and yellow blood bursts from the threshing 
ALIEN's wound.  Speckles of it dot KAMEN's leg, eating through the 
material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath.  He 
SCREAMS, a sound of pure intense pain...

HIROKO hurls the axe aside.  She begins pulling KAMEN out of the hole 
as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit.  
There's a SPARKING, followed by a FLASH and a SHEET OF FLAME.  CASSIE 
steps through into the corridor, just as valves evenly-spaced along the 
length of the tunnel open up, jetting white high-density foam under 
extreme pressure.  The hatch to the Command Center at the far end 
begins to close...

HIROKO
Cassie...!

CASSIE's head shoots around.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

YORK seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it 
into the narrowing divide.  CASSIE squeezes through the gap and 
urgently HOLLERS to HIROKO...

CASSIE
It you don't... uh!... move your ass, you're gonna need a helluva diet 
to get through here!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

from CASSIE's P.O.V. we watch HIROKO supporting KAMEN and stumbling him 
along.  Foam fills three-quarters of the corridor to their rear and is 
nearly up to their knees everywhere else.  The chair's frame CREAKS 
ominously in protest...

YORK
Hurry up, we're losing it!

CASSIE's eyes widen in terror...

CASSIE
Behind you!

HIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge 
momentarily from out of the foam.  Something yanks at KAMEN and he 
disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise...

HIROKO
Kamen!

HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags 
her away.

CASSIE
It's too late!

HIROKO
Nooooo!

The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself...

YORK
It's going!

With a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap.  YORK 
vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER 
closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

The battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.  There's only 
three of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK.

A projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in 
flight into a wire capture net.  Barbed tips on each corner bite into 
the wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.  Small motors 
WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body...
 
The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too 
long. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.  The 
shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and 
CLATTERS to the floor.

The PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his 
wrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but 
gets no further.  An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.  The 
PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight 
through the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer 
in the process.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed 
disbelief.

PARSONS
Miss Noguchi?

No reaction.  He tries again.

PARSONS (CONT'D)
Miss Noguchi!

HIROKO snaps out of it.  She crosses over to the bank of monitoring 
screens.

HIROKO
What's the story?

PARSONS runs through each of the screens.

PARSONS
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', 
and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally 
evacuate.

HIROKO
How many... how many people are missing?

CASSIE
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over 
the place.

HIROKO
What's our weapons situation?

DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly.

DRISCOLL
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We 
got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.

HIROKO
Auto-shop?

CASSIE
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.

HIROKO
Has anybody talked to them?

CASSIE
Not yet.

HIROKO
Do it.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK

BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a 
bid to escape their unstoppable opponents.  Back-to-back, they take up 
fighting positions.  A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS 
arrives.

Both the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley. 
Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's 
hand-to-hand...and nothing else.

It's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides.  BROKEN TUSK takes 
flight; his companion is not as lucky.  The other PREDATOR kicks an 
ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.  The ALIEN lashes out with 
lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.  Both creatures 
hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of 
the modules.  Caught like flies in a spider's web.  Both thrash about, 
severing cables as they do.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the 
air...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and 
the bank of monitors turn to static.  There's an instant of silence 
collective concerns amongst those gathered there.

DRISCOLL
What the hell...?

PARSONS
Don't panic, people.  We've just switched over to internals.

HIROKO
They knocked out the external feeds.

PARSONS
Looks like it.

CASSIE
Thirty six hours?

PARSONS nods.

PARSONS
Give or take.

CASSIE
We're not gonna make it, are we?

HIROKO
Get the auto-shop on-line.

PARSONS shakes his head.

PARSONS
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk.  
That's down with the other feeds.

HIROKO
Well... try the headset.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

Spirits are low in the auto-shop.

MATT
I'm tellin' you, it's impossible.  Nothing can grow and reproduce this 
fast.

THOMAS
Yeah.  Right.  You wanna go outside and tell them that?

DE VRIES
What's keeping those fucking Marines, man? They should'a been here by 
now!

THOMAS lashes out at an empty can, kicking it noisily across the floor.

THOMAS
Maybe they ain't coming.  Maybe they don't even know we've got 
problems...

GUTTIEREZ
I don't wanna hear that kind of crap, Thomas.  They're coming.  Just a 
matter of time, that's all...

GUTTIEREZ' headset lies nearby.  PARSONS muted VOICE comes out of it.  
One of the GREASE MONKEY's snatches it up and listens.

GREASE MONKEY
Yo!  Guttierez!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS
Through now.

HIROKO
Jan, it's Hiroko.  What sort of shape are you in down there?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speaker)
Pretty damn good shape, considering.  You can tell Don Kamen from me 
his people have got balls of steel.

HIROKO
Kamen didn't make it, Jan.

There's a pregnant PAUSE from the speakers.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jan?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Yeah.  I... we're still here.  We're all... uh... all sorry to hear 
that.

HIROKO
Can you make it back?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Uh... I'd say that was a negative.  If we open the doors, those things 
are gonna swarm inside.  There's another problem, too.

HIROKO
What's that?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
De Vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on 
the way in here.  Right now, the stuff sprayin' out is just burnin' up, 
but if we get a blow-back, a good part of the station could go with it.

CASSIE
Oh, man...

HIROKO
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... 
there's got to be a way out of this.

YORK
Oh yeah?  Like what?

YORK's kept quiet, but everyone turns to him now.  His tone is scathing 
and cuts to the marrow.

CASSIE
Well, what about those other things outside; those warriors?  Maybe we 
can cut some kind of deal...

YORK looks around at them in incredulous disbelief.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

MATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.  Everybody's eyes are 
on him.

MATT
Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load 
the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.  That way we could put a 
bit of distance...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

MATT (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)
...Between us and the station.  Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell 
arrive.

HIROKO
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?

DRISCOLL
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for 
remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and 
running.

HIROKO
Which mean physically going outside.

DRISCOLL looks around uneasily.

DRISCOLL
Yeah.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK

A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are 
clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor.  
HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.  Across 
her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.  She nods at a 
pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands.

HIROKO
Is this the suit?

DRISCOLL
Uh-huh.

She takes it from him.  Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls 
it up.  YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his 
face.

YORK
This is fuckin' lunacy!  You're not gonna make it across the platform 
on foot!

CASSIE
Shut up, York.

HIROKO
No, he's right.  Has anyone got a bike near here?

A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice.

REDHEADED GIRL
I have.

HIROKO
Let me have the keys.

The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.  HIROKO puts 
them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Which one is it?

REDHEADED GIRL
Uh... the Hyundai racer.  Yellow and black stripes.

YORK
Oh, yeah.  Real inconspicuous...

HIROKO
Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it 
gets me there in one piece.  Somebody loan me a headset.

CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.  DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO 
fasten up the suit.  He spots a mistake.

DRISCOLL
No, go back.  Second clasp from the bottom.

HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it.

HIROKO
How much air-time have I got?

CASSIE
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to 
admire the scenery.

HIROKO
Deal.

CASSIE
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into 
the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the 
inside of the glass as you go.

DRISCOLL
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the 
helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.

HIROKO
Sounds great.

PARSONS
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll 
be going in blind.

HIROKO
What?  Why?

DRISCOLL
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits 
you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around 
reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights 
would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down 
there oughta be enough to do the trick.

HIROKO
How tight are these shafts?

CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks.

CASSIE
Tight.  We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running 
into any Aliens.

HIROKO takes a deep breath.  Beads of perspiration dot her forehead.  
PARSONS nods.

PARSONS
There's still time to back-out.

HIROKO
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do 
myself.  Where's the disk?

PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet.

PARSONS
Don't lose it.

HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap.

HIROKO
Don't worry.  I won't.

DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO.

DRISCOLL
Here.  If you got to use 'em, make 'em count.

They're magazines for her gun.  She slots them into the bandolier.

HIROKO
Thanks.

PARSONS
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it 
straight.

HIROKO
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and 
press the green enabling button...

PARSONS   (interrupting)
No.  There's two of them.

She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place.

HIROKO
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...

PARSONS
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of 
there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke 
some kind of response.

YORK hands over a sophisticated-looking power-tool.

YORK
You'll need this for the gratings. Trigger finger to operate, thumb 
button to switch over to the rivet gun.  The sensors'll choose blade or 
socket heads automatically.

HIROKO
Right.   (long beat)   Okay, I'm set.

YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKO's 
head. Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar.  
PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back, and DRISCOLL makes the 
connections. 

PARSONS
Alright, let's open her up.  Carefully, now...

CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily 
at a fixed point on the ground.  Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the 
pressure-hatch beneath the floor-grating.  It's identical to the one 
DILLER and URIOSTE removed earlier.  A plume of pressurised gas jets 
into the air, and they pull the metal sealing-plug free.  CASSIE 
scrutinizes her tracker...

CASSIE
All clear...

HIROKO reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one 
side.

HIROKO's P.O.V.
We're looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open 
shaft, braken water SLOSHING around it's rim.  Superimposed lines of 
glowing neon appear on the visor's surface, a precisely overlaid 
duplication of the scene in computer-graphic form.  A flatly-
synthesised male

COMPUTER VOICE comes over the helmet speakers, O.S.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Approaching 'A' module lower level venturiduct DS Oh-four...

HIROKO gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening.  
She stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension.  Tries to 
reassure herself.

HIROKO
Okay.  Okay.

She looks around at the impassive, staring faces.  Summoning up her 
courage, she submerges the helmet...

HIROKO'S P.O.V.
The pale illumination of the lower level deck-lights gives way to 
absolute nothingness; a stygian nightmare.  She SHUDDERS with horror 
and pulls her head free.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Oh...!  Oh, God...

She WIPES frenetically at the slickly-coated visor, breathing heavily. 
Worried hands grab her.

CASSIE
Are you alright?

PARSONS
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?

HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes.  She swallows hard and 
calms down.

HIROKO
It's alright.  I'm okay.

Steeling herself, she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into 
the water once more...

HIROKO's P.O.V.
Everything goes to blackness again.  The head-up-display presents a 
view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy-apple hues.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Entering venturi duct, en route to secondary overflow sump DS oh four 
slash eleven...

YORK watches HIROKO's feet disappear into the shaft.

PARSONS
Seal it.

The heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned 
over the hole.  YORK shakes his head.

YORK
Suicide run, man.  Fuckin' suicide run.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

CASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct.  It's only about half-
again as wide as HIROKO.  The only illumination comes from the hazy 
circle above.  As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone.

Something flickers.  Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the 
murk with a faint orange haze.

CASSIE   (O.S. on speakers)
All the comforts of home.

HIROKO
Thanks, Cassie.

CASSIE   (O.S., on speakers)
Don't mention it.

She inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing 
heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is 
overwhelming in the  silence...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ANTENNA ARRAY - NIGHT

The station's massive antenna array is being transformed.  Otherworldly 
shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to 
cover it's surface.  ALIENS drop from dizzying heights, exuding streams 
of gelatinous gunk from the four 'exhaust' pipes on their backs.  
They're building a nest of staggering proportions.

Unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids, faint sparks flicker from the 
crane catwalk high above...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

BROKEN TUSK sits on the catwalk floor, a small shower of sparks 
lighting his face.  He's attempting to repair his broken wrist computer 
with an intricate tool.  He removes it and presses a switch.  The 
display glows briefly, then fades.  He inserts it again.  Electrical 
sparks CRACKLE across the computer's fascia, before burning out.  
BROKEN TUSK throws the ruined machine away in disgust.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

From our P.O.V. high up near the roof of the auto-shop we see THOMAS 
sitting on the raised hydraulic platform.  He GRUNTS as he pulls a 
valve on the crawler's underside.

Across the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.  One of 
the GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on.

GREASE MONKEY
Okay.  Back.  Back.  Little bit more...

He steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing.

GREASE MONKEY (CONT'D)
Whoa...shit!

The man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the 
floor. Scowls first, then frowns.  It's sticky.

Over near the doors, MATT exhales deeply on a cigarette.  DE VRIES is 
nearby, listening attentively as GUTTIEREZ gets a message on his 
helmet.

GUTTIEREZ
She just set off!

MATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's 
attention.

MATT
Okay, people.  Let's hustle...

There's a SCREAM from behind.  They wheel around in time to see the 
GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening.  THOMAS yells 
down from the platform.

THOMAS
They're comin' up through the pit!

A box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the 
ceiling on the end of a cable.  MATT forces down the red control, 
making the platform lower.  Several tons of machinery and crawler bring 
about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, 
CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens.

An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the 
nearby shadows.  DE VRIES sights it.

DE VRIES
Over there!

One of the MEN has seen it.  His head snaps up to a mammoth engine-
block suspended from a winch high above.  He LEAPS for the release-
catch as the ALIEN passes underneath.  Pulls hard on the grip.  Chains 
RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.  The ALIEN begins to look 
up, just a second too late.  The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into 
the creature, flattening it instantly.

Unseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the 
platform-bound crawler.  It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the 
face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.  The 
LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets 
THOMAS' attention.

THOMAS
Mother-fucker!

THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.  The 
ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering 
THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.  The ALIEN discards the body 
and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up.

The blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. 
THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.  Something happens to the PITCH 
of the blade, a peculiar sound...

The acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.  Like a metallic 
snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame.

Straight at THOMAS.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

HIROKO elbows her way further through the cramped water-filled duct.  A 
wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  Green neon flashes in her display, with accompanying 
notations.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Progress to secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven impeded.  
Grating must be removed to facilitate entry...

HIROKO   (into headset)
Okay, I'm at the first access grate.

CASSIE's VOICE is a little less clear now, with traces of STATIC 
drifting in...

CASSIE  (O.S., on speakers)
Copy that.  Be careful, now.

HIROKO
You betcha.

She places the tip of her power-tool over the first of the grille's 
anchoring bolts.  The complex mechanism WHINES as it selects the 
correct wrench-tip for the job...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS races up to the GIRL manning the communication console.

PARSONS
What is it?

GIRL
Auto-shop.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP- CRAWLER CABIN

THOMAS is laid-out in the back seat of the crawler's cab, with DE VRIES 
and MATT trying to staunch the wounds from the chainsaw band's impact 
to his chest.  GUTTIEREZ speaks into his headset mike.

GUTTIEREZ
Rob?  We got problems.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER

THUMP.  THUMP.  SLAM!  The grille in knocked out of it's housing and 
floats lazily off into the water.  HIROKO passes through the newly-
created hole.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
She finds herself in an upright cylindrical chamber, about five feet in 
height.  Massive extractor fans churn dangerously where both the floor 
and ceiling ought to be.  Kicking up a swirl of particles.  Pale blue 
light filters down from above.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Caution!  Entering secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven.  
Grating must be removed to facilitate entry to Central Reservoir...

HIROKO   (annoyed)
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

With difficulty, she straddles the floor turbine.  A vortex of water 
swirls around her as she brings the power-tool up once more.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS listens attentively.  He CLICKS his fingers at CASSIE.

PARSONS
Where is she?

CASSIE
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.

PARSONS
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop 
maintenance pit.

CASSIE's all-business, immediately calling-up the base floor-plan files 
on a monitor.

PARSONS (CONT'D)  (into headset)
Is Thomas gonna make it?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Uh...difficult to say.  I think...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

GUTTIEREZ looks on as MATT ties-off a bandage.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
...The chainsaw band might have punctured his lungs.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE looks up, worriedly.

CASSIE
I found it...

PARSONS
And?

CASSIE
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.

PARSONS
Get her on-line.  Now!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CENTER

HIROKO's pulls her third bolt free.  It drifts slowly downward, 
slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine.

A fragmented VOICE comes through on her headset, distorted beyond 
recognition.  HIROKO's forehead knits together in concentration and 
annoyance.

HIROKO
What was that?  I don't copy.

CLICK.  CLICK.  BEEP!  The routine sound of the motion tracker changes 
suddenly.  HIROKO turns her attention from the task-in-hand to study 
the tracker's helmet readout.  THREE NEBULOUS BLOBS have appeared from 
off-screen.  Heading straight for her position.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE turns to PARSONS in frustration.

CASSIE
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.

PARSONS
Keep trying!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER

BEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.  The signals pick-up speed the closer they get.  
CASSIE's garbled VOICE isn't helping ease HIROKO's panic.  She looks 
wildly around the chamber.  The only way out the way she came in...

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate 
access to...

HIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control.  The COMPUTER VOICE ceases, 
while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume.  
Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her...

HIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct.  It's position makes it 
virtually impossible to get back into.  She tries anyhow.

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!  A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber, 
flattening her against the wall.  DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other 
side of the grille like express trains in the night...going away from 
HIROKO.  She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor 
screen recede and finally disappear.  The tracker's pitch returns to 
it's hollow CLICKING.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

BROKEN TUSK tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through 
the aftermath of the battle down by the now-empty rhino pen.  He finds 
something. A PREDATOR face-mask, with a massive crack down one side.  
He turns it carefully over in his hands.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

HIROKO emerges from the water, a thin membrane of surface slime 
adhering to her helmet.  Blinded, she raises a gloved hand and wipes 
the mucus away...

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
She's inside the Central Reservoir, a long cylindrical concrete tunnel 
some eighteen feet in diameter.  The water-level comes up about half-
way.  What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion...

She's found the main offshoot of the ALIENS' nest.  Glued into the 
curved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.  HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS.  
Other ANIMALS.  Most are dead, their innards blown open.  The rest are 
comatose, twitching occasionally.  Every square inch not containing 
bodies is filled with ALIEN EGGS.  It's like Hell for real.

HIROKO reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout. 

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
...Brrzzt.  Traversing Central Reservoir en route to platform venturi 
dust DS two-six.

HIROKO's P.O.V.
She looks around and finds the exit point on the display. It's several 
feet away.  Under the surface.  She wades swiftly through the water, 
passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause.  A large 
PULSATING BAG, about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape.  It 
might be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell.

HIROKO submerges.  Sure enough, there's the grille.  She raises the 
power-tool and starts extracting the bolts.  BZZZZ!  There's the first 
one, no problem.  BZZZZ...BZZZZ!  The second and third are just as 
easy.  She goes for the fourth.  BZZZ...CHUNK.  Nothing happens.

HIROKO
Come on...

She bears down on the trigger again.  The motor's not running.  A tiny 
green LED flashes on the machine's side.  It's locked solid.  A 
malfunction.

COMPUTER VOICE  (O.S., on speakers)
Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate 
access to  venturi ducts.

There's only one recourse left to her.  She jams down the thumb 
button...

KER-SLAM!  The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her 
internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface.  She wipes the 
slime from her helmet yet again...

...And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in 
four neat sections.  The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate... 

...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery 
dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates 
itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself 
back toward her.  It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.  HIROKO 
raises the power-tool,
reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.  Fat rivets RIP 
through the FACEHUGGER's body.  It writhes around on the water's 
surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.  HIROKO dives 
into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt.

BZZZZ!  It's out!  She levers-off the grille.  Forces herself into the 
confined space beyond...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

Another poorly-lit shaft filled with murky water, though this one goes 
upwards on a diagonal slope.  HIROKO braces herself against the walls 
and begins to climb.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speaker)
Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface.

WHAM!  An ALIEN's head squeezes through the opening behind her.  It's 
claw snakes in, groping blindly just inches from her feet.  She grits 
her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent.
 
WALLPO!  It's hand closes around her leg, yanking her back.  She tries 
frantically to gain purchase on anything.  She fails.  The ALIEN draws 
her nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.  Fracture 
lines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.  Polluted water starts 
to flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass.

HIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger.  
Rivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.  A 
haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.  HIROKO pushes upward, 
coughing.  She closes her fist around a lever above.  Pulls on it with 
all her might.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Internal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork.  
It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK.  HIROKO hauls herself from the 
shaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.  She 
throws the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.  Yanks 
desperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment 
off.

As promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.  HIROKO starts 
towards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the 
ruined pressure-suit.  She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through 
the smoking pile of cloth.  Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws 
the keys.

SLAP!  A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.  HIROKO 
scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.  She tears 
across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.  The turbines 
ROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.  HIROKO pivots the 
powerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp.  
Losing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck.

HIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.  The fire 
over by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and-
orange smoke rising into the air.
 
A DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.  Yet 
another ALIEN.  It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the 
hoverbike, gaining balance in an instant.
 
HIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see-
sawing the bike side-to-side.  The ALIEN's got a firm hold though, 
crawling hand-over-hand towards her.  HIROKO releases her grip on both 
throttles simultaneously.  Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a 
halt.  The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the 
surrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls 
it back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the 
leading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising 
creature, neatly decapitating it. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT

The hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.  HIROKO 
dismounts and draws her pistol.  Takes in the sheer height of the 
ladder she's going to have to scale.  Thumbs her headset. 

HIROKO
Okay, I make it to the crane.  You...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Everybody in admin registers astonishment as her voice comes over the

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)

DRISCOLL's moving even as PARSONS speaks.

DRISCOLL
I hear you...

EXT.  RHUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

HIROKO reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the 
Control Cab. She narrowly misses something metallic near the base of 
the handrail.  If she'd taken the time to stop and look, she would have 
seen BROKEN TUSK's ruined wrist computer.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL

DRISCOLL flips open an access flap on one wall of the ladder-well.  
Printed on the inside is a set of instructions, with the following 
printed boldly in red;

CAUTION!  EXPLOSIVE BOLTS - READ CAREFULLY!

He traces his finger along a line of text.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

HIROKO enters the cab at a run.  She flips a row of switches, and the 
control board comes to life.

HIROKO
Access panel... access panel...

She finds it.  Gets her fingers in the groove and slides it out.  
Beneath is a mini-disk drive with two buttons.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Bingo.

She pulls the vinyl-wrapped packet from her catsuit pocket.  Carefully 
withdraws the disk and slides it home.  Thumbs the first button, which 
glows an emerald green.

The board's flatscreen monitor lights up immediately.  HIROKO studies 
it for a moment, then presses her headset link.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Okay, we're in business.

turns it.  A tiny red LED comes on.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER MODULE

Complex mechanical assemblies attach the module to it's supporting 
pier-platforms.  There are a number of LOUD BANGS, similar to car

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL

DRISCOLL reports into his headset.

DRISCOLL
Bolts blown!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

HIROKO runs back across the catwalk.  She might have missed the 
PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.  Her 
foot comes down on it and she slips.  The gun goes flying from her 
hand.  HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for 
a moment...

HIROKO
No!

...Then goes over.  She drops to all fours and peers over the side.  
Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.  She 
reaches out for it...

INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB

GUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.  The head-up

GUTTIEREZ
Shit!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

KER-SMASM!  GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway

a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in 
a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE.

MATT
Yee-haa!  Demolition derby, baby!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the 
gigantic crane moving against the night sky.

PREDATOR VISION.  
Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good 
enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk.

The sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN 
TUSK's attention.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

HIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring 
herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.  She 
brushes the barrel. Not good enough.  Tries again.  Success!  Her 
fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The two crawlers plunge into the curtain of flames spreading across the 
platform.

INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT

DE VRIES YELLS at GUTTIEREZ over the ROAR of the flames.

DE VRIES
Hotter 'n hell out there!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT

HIROKO leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the 
platform.  She dashes towards the hoverbike, some thirty feet away.  
With no time to loose, she slides her boots into the foot-supports, 
which automatically WHIRR closed.  Gropes for the ignition key...

Before she's even located it, the hoverbike moves.  SCRAPING across the 
concrete.  ALIEN claws appear around the edge of one of the bike's 
manta wings.  She's parked the bike over a drainage exit!

HIROKO SPINS the key and guns the engine.  The white-hot downblast from 
the turbine exhaust SPLASHES across the SCREECHING ALIENS.  The vehicle 
tilts and KICKS forward.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The two crawlers emerge from the conflagration, scorched and trailing 
fire. In the BACKGROUND, the crane-hoist centers over the admin module.

CATWALK P.O.V., 
looking straight down.  Four lasers scan quickly around the module's 
edges.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

A blinking message on the crane's monitor screen:
POSITIVE MATCH.  COMMENCE LIFTING OPERATION.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

The sound of SHREDDING METAL makes HIROKO look down.  An ALIEN is 
hanging on the underside of the bike!  She twists the throttle, 
reducing acceleration and causing the vehicle to drop several inches.  
Sparks shower the ground from where the creature makes contact with the 
roadway.  The ALIEN's determination is astounding.  It's tail SLAMS up 
through the alloy 'wing', anchoring it.

The biomechanoid starts to pulls itself up, shifting the bike's center 
of gravity.  She fights the controls, but finds herself swerving.  One-
handed, she takes aim.  BLAM!  BLAM!  She misses the ALIEN, rupturing a 
fuel pipe instead.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The crane's clamping mechanism closes around the admin module, locking 
into place.

CLANG!  Everybody reacts as the SOUND penetrates through the walls and 
ECHOES around admin.

PARSONS
Okay, people.  Hold on tight...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The crane hoists the module aloft, free of it's umbilicals.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Pencils, disposable cups, and anything else not bolted down all roll 
from table-tops.  Most are grabbed by their owners.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

HIROKO's bike veers blindly around the corner of a building, with 
HIROKO still SHOOTING.  She looks up and her eyes widen.  Ahead is the 
out-of-control blaze.  A tongue of flame licks out across the platform, 
directly in her path.

HIROKO slides the gun quickly into her shoulder-holster and ducks for 
cover behind the bike's windshield.  The ALIEN's head twists around, 
and they plunge into the inferno...

WHOOMPH!  The liquid from the breached pipe ignites, trailing a plume 
of yellow flame.  HIROKO jams down on the foot-release and wrenches the 
steering bar hard to the right.  She leaps for safety as the burning 
bike with it's ALIEN passenger crashes through the station's safety-
rail and plummets into the swamp.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM RAMP - NIGHT

The two crawlers THUNDER down the ramp.  GUTTIEREZ' vehicle pulls into 
a tight right turn, while MATT's continues on it's course.  The crane 
with it's underslug module continues to RUMBLE slowly forward. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

HIROKO mechanically tries to get up from the concrete roadway.  Winces. 
Something hurts.  She looks down at the back of her left hand.  The 
skin has been scraped away. 

A DISTANT NOISE, something else being broken.  HIROKO turns.  Through 
the conflagration, ALIENS are advancing.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ' smoldering crawler pulls-up alongside Big Bertha's titanic 
wheels.

INT. FIRST CRAWLER - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ turns his head to one of the guys in the rear. 

GUTTIEREZ
Take the wheel, Roy!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES exit the crawler in a big hurry.  The moment 
they're clear, the vehicle starts up and is gone.  DE VRIES is alert, 
the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings.

DE VRIES
C'mon, man!  Let's shag it!

GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's 
cab.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

HIROKO's running along the platform, pistol clenched firmly in hand.  
She thumbs her headset.

HIROKO
Rob, it's Hiroko.  Come in.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE answers, holding on to the edge of her console.

CASSIE
Hiroko, it's Cassie.  What's...

HIROKO's VOICE interrupts.

HIROKO   (O.S., on speakers)
I've lost the bike and I'm cut-off.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

HIROKO spins around the corner, pointing her gun cop-stance.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't 
wait for me.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE
But...

EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The heli-jet pad's just up ahead.  The relief on HIROKO's face is 
enormous.

HIROKO
No 'buts'.  Just do it.  Noguchi out.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's 
cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control 
fascia pointing out-back.  DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides 
into the rear.  She flicks on an overhead light.  Taped to one side is 
a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder.
 
DE VRIES
Nice buns...

She gives the control board a cursory once-over.  GUTTIEREZ calls back 
from his vantage point at the doorway.

GUTTIEREZ
Can you handle it?

DE VRIES powers-up the console.

DE VRIES
Piece of cake.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - NIGHT

HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet.  The flicker of an 
andrenalin-fueled smile plays on her face...the disappears.

Like a scorpion scuttling over a rock, the ALIEN climbs up on top of 
the grounded machine.  It's head turn towards her.  HIROKO starts to 
raise her pistol... then stops.  Other ALIENS are descending the nearby 
navigation tower... straight for her.

HIROKO turns tail.  She races over to a ladder running up the side of a 
building and begins to climb.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

The shadow of the crane and it's cargo falls over Big Bertha's rear 
flatbed. Flashing warning strobes illuminate the twin hydraulic arms 
which rise up to meet it.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

DE VRIES twists on the 'waldo' controls operating the manipulator 
hands. 

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT

ALIENS rise up out of the swamp below, and start to scale Bertha's 
balloon tires.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ fires a barrage down at the oncoming creatures.  He HOLLERS 
back to DE VRIES.

GUTTIEREZ
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!

DE VRIES
Couple more seconds!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like 
a pack of dogs.  She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with 
ease. So do the ALIENS.

She cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the 
main street, trying not to lose her footing.  Just before reaching the 
other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.  Her headset drops 
thirty feet onto the concrete roadway.  Her hand rests on something 
red.  It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to 
the building.  She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch.  
Glances up.  The ALIENS are already starting across.  She pulls the 
primer cylinder out by it's handle.  Jams it into the detonator, and 
turns...

She's practically on top of the bolts.  The EXPLOSION is DEAFENING.  
With the clamp on this side free, the conduit falls into the street 
with a SCREECH of twisted metal.  One of the ALIENS is pulverized by 
the falling debris, but the others survive.  All HIROKO's managed to do 
is buy herself some breathing space...

She races across the building's roof.  Reaches the other 
side...straight into a dead end.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

The admin module locks onto Bertha's manipulator arms with a satisfying 
CLUNK.  Autocouplers slot into place, and the crane releases it's load.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The connecting jolt is even greater then before.  Several larger 
objects CRASH to the deck.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

DE VRIES
That's it!  We've got it!  Get us out of here.

GUTTIEREZ looses one last volley at the ALIENS.  He pulls the cab door 
shut, and throws himself into the driver's seat.

GUTTIEREZ
C'mon sweetheart.  Do your stuff...

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT

Bertha's wheels GRIND to life, spilling ALIENS and crushing them under 
it's treads...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO's P.O.V.  It's a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete, with 
no ladders or any other way down.  She looks desperately around for 
another avenue of escape.

The leering face of an ALIEN comes up over the roof's edge.  HIROKO 
swings her pistol over and fires.  It falls away...only to be replaced 
seconds later by two others.

Her gun goes dry.  Quick as a flash, she ejects the spent magazine.  
She slaps the spare in and continues firing.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

Big Bertha's heading away from the base into the surrounding trees. 
GUTTIEREZ grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches. 

GUTTIEREZ
Get down!

DE VRIES hits the floor.  The thick boughs impact with the cab, 
SHATTERING the safety glass.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  CLICK.  HIROKO's gun's empty.  She reaches 
for another clip on her bandolier...then realises that was her last 
one.

The encircling ALIENS HISS triumphantly and close in.  With no place to 
go, and no means of defending herself, HIROKO's a goner.  The lead 
ALIEN's lethal double-barrel teeth open.  It's almost on her.  HIROKO 
CRIES OUT...

WHOOSH!  The ALIEN's face is severed in half.  A circular metal object 
blurs through the air and loops back on itself, almost faster then the 
human eye can follow.  A massive form SLAMS down in front of HIROKO, 
pushing her out of the way.  She hits the deck hard and gasps.  BROKEN 
TUSK is standing before her.  He skillfully catches the frisbee-like 
'smart weapon', then
throws it again.

HIROKO watches with awe as the PREDATOR joins battle against the 
ALIENS. HISSING ALIEN jaws are silenced by BROKEN TUSK's formidable 
fighting  technique.  Questing limbs are BLASTED and HACKED away by 
advanced PREDATOR weaponry.  Acidic blood flows freely.  The skirmish 
is surprisingly brief.

BROKEN TUSK and HIROKO stare at one another.  BROKEN TUSK pulls a slung 
metal rod from his shoulder.  Two barbed tips SCHNICK outwards, forming 
a spear. The PREDATOR looks at her, and his lip curls.  It takes a 
second for HIROKO to realise he's offering it to her.  Bewildered, she 
accepts it, pulling herself up.

A bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind, getting both of 
their attentions.  BROKEN TUSK regards her.  His mandibles CLICK-CLACK 
nervously... 

HIROKO
Look.  Don't take this the wrong way, but when I imagined the cavalry 
coming to my rescue... they never looked like you.

The PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Another gout of flame BELCHES out of the churning mass in the middle of 
the station.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO turns her recovered headset over in her hands. 

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Broken.  Useless!

She throws it aside.  BROKEN TUSK stands beside her, keeping guard.  
Another DETONATION goes off behind, even LOUDER.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jesus.  I.C.C.'re gonna have to close the book on this place.

She SLAPS BROKEN TUSK on the arm.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Come on, Butch.  Let's go.

She begins to walk away.  BROKEN TUSK crosses to the safety barrier, 
peering over the side...

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hey!  I said come on!

The PREDATOR turns a deaf ear to her.  He gauges the distance below, 
then throws himself off the platform's edge.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
What...?

She races across to the rail and gazes downward.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.
The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see.  
HIROKO looks around the platform.  She's suddenly very alone.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Shit!

She crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.  BROKEN TUSK 
has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform 
piers, running directly out into the swamp.  Most of the drain is 
underwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water.  
The thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.  Broken from 
within.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
You've got to be joking.  No way am I going back in there!

No joke.  BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hey!

BROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.  He gives her a look, then disappears 
into the blackness.  HIROKO looks around.  It's no fun being the last 
person left alive here.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Goddammit!

She takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT

HIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.  She shivers.  
It's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.  Several of the 
maintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal. 

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (quietly)
Wha...?

BROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.  She gets the 
message.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

They exit the culvert through another smashed grate.  HIROKO finds 
herself back in the Central Reservoir again.  She wades through the 
water behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.  The two of 
them look very vulnerable in here.  They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC 
HIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.  An INSIDIOUS 
PULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they 
travel.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

They come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by 
an enormous pump.  ALIEN gunk covers everything.

HIROKO gasps.  High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast 
mechanism.  It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around 
it. She seems to be asleep.

BROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.  His eyes are searching the multitude of 
forms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.  He finds what 
he's looking for.  Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.  Dead.  It's 
stomach blown open.

HIROKO holds her spear tightly.  FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped 
around several trapped victims.  A number of empty EGGS are scattered 
here-and-there.

BROKEN TUSK looks around.  No ALIENS.  He begins climbing the organic 
fresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.  The 
bellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.  He reaches the 
entrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of 
secreted resin.  BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates 
it.

The SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.  She glances up at the QUEEN.  
It's breathing start to change, and it's head moves...

BROKEN TUSK sees it too.  He hesitates for a moment.  The QUEEN 
settles, and her breathing goes back to normal.  BROKEN TUSK resumes 
his work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.  He sheathes the 
'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.  He 
withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to 
work...

DOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.  She doesn't see the arm coated in 
slime that grasps at her hair.  She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.  Her 
eyes are wide as she turns...

It's KAMEN.  He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.  When he 
speaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering.

KAMEN
Hiroko...

HIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE.

UP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.  He slides the tip 
of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.  It's readout display 
illuminates with alien characters.  He activates a button, and the 
readout begins to blink...

BELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO.

KAMEN (CONT'D)
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I 
don't...remember what happened next.

HIROKO
What can I do?

KAMEN
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.

HIROKO
I... I can't!

KAMEN
You have to...

HIROKO
No!

BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.  He raises his right arm.  
SCHNICK! 
The wrist knives slice outwards.  Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale 
face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

BROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.  An ALIEN EGG on a 
nearby wall PEELS OPEN.  Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to 
spring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting 
through the EGG and it's writhing contents.

The two of them reach the deep end and have to wade.  HIROKO pushes 
herself along the biomechanical outcropping.  Ahead of them is the 
PULSING SAC. Before they're even passed beneath it, they hear 
SOMETHING.  A SOUND like water-filled balloons hitting wet concrete.
 
The SAC ruptures, spattering thick gloopy matter.  A form comprised of  
slender limbs emerges from within.  An IMMATURE QUEEN ALIEN.  Though 
just-born, it's reflexes are razor-sharp.  It lashes out at HIROKO and 
BROKEN TUSK.  HIROKO ducks, and the QUEEN's claws embed themselves in 
BROKEN TUSK's shoulder, destroying his automatic cannon.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN

A VAST EXPLOSION rips through the base, broiling clouds of flame 
rolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

Columns of fire jet from fissures and openings inside the Pump Chamber, 
rippling across the adult QUEEN ALIEN and her hapless victims.  She 
begins to SCREAM, flailing around atop her metal throne... 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

The adult QUEEN's SHRIEK echoes through the reservoir, accompanied by a 
ball of fire that travels part of the way down.  The IMMATURE QUEEN 
turns her head in reply, answering with her own YOWL.

BROKEN TUSK HISSES with hate, and brings his 'smart weapon' SLICING 
down through her arm, severing it at the wrist.  HIROKO simultanesouly 
DRIVES her spear into the ALIEN's chest.  She grabs the injured 
PREDATOR and pulls him away from the thrashing creature.

HIROKO
Come on!  Come on!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

The alien numbers on the PREDATOR self-destruct readout inexorably 
count down...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN

The metal plug HIROKO blew during her earlier escape still lies to one 
side of the duct HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK crawl hastily out of.  
Fireballs are erupting all around now, making their situation 
precarious. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

From a vantage point high above, we see HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK racing 
across the platform towards the heli-jet pad. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK stumbles and falls.  HIROKO bends down to help him up, but 
the PREDATOR shoves her away.  He doesn't want her assistance.

HIROKO
If you don't move your ugly butt, we're gonna end up barbecued!  Come 
on!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
 
HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet, with the PREDATOR close 
behind. The landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles 
designed to deflect downward exhaust gases.  HIROKO's feet CLATTER 
across the metal...

KER-SMASH!  The metal is SMASHED from beneath, right in front of her.  
The IMMATURE ALIEN QUEEN has made is out of the sewer system and has 
got the jump on them.  HIROKO's forward momentum won't allow her to 
stop running...she's too close.  Almost at the last moment, she jumps.  
claws brush her trouser leg, but close on thin air.  She hits the deck 
and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper.

BROKEN TUSK stops.  ALIENS are appearing all over the pad and out of 
nearby drainage ducts.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO slips into the chopper's pilot seat.  She flips a bunch of 
switches and the turbines RISE in VOLUME from a LOW WHINE to a DULL 
ROAR. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN

An orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind BROKEN TUSK.  With the 
ALIENS blocking his path, there's no refuge for him. Almost.  The 
Navigation Tower looms overhead, nearby.  BROKEN TUSK takes a 
calculated risk and LEAPS for it.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter.  HIROKO 
pulls-back on the collective, and the turbines' pitch changes from a 
THROATY GROWL to a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet rises, a little unsteadily.  The wash from the turbines 
plays across the SHRIEKING ALIENS.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  Through the canopy dome, we see BROKEN TUSK climbing 
the Navigation Tower, with the ALIENS close behind.

HIROKO
Okay, Butch.  I can play cavalry, too...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK scales the ladder as quickly as he can.  As the top of the 
tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array.

The IMMATURE QUEEN, accompanied by a phalanx of warrior ALIENS, is 
almost upon him.  The PREDATOR drives his wrist knives into the throat 
of a grasping ALIEN, which falls downward, writhing.  It CRASHES into 
the QUEEN, who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork.  She 
HISSES, lashing out at the creature.  Sends it hurtling to the ground.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK makes it to the top.  There's not much space on the catwalk 
to maneuver.  He looks around, then down.  This is his last stand. 
Instinctively, he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct 
computer. Of course, it's not there.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

The third row of digits on the alien destruct mechanism disappear.  
Time's running out...fast.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK SMASHES his foot hard into the face of an ALIEN.  A BLAST 
of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer.  He turns...

HIROKO's heli-jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the 
tower, the door on the co-pilot's side flapping open.  She HOLLERS at 
the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines.

HIROKO
C'mon!  Jump!

BROKEN TUSK looks down.  It's a long drop...but it's the best option 
available to him.  He jumps.

THWACK!  His hands grip the door frame.  The heli-jet wobbles slightly, 
it's center of gravity shifting.  BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and 
through the door as...

...KER-BLAM!  A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the 
storage tanks below ignite.  The shock wave buffets the chopper against 
the tower.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK's P.O.V.
The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli-
jet is propelled towards the metal structure.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN

CRUNCH!  The chopper hits, knocking several ALIENS from their 
handholds.  One of the QUEEN's arms SHOOTS OUT, wrapping itself around 
the port engine mount.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO pushes on the stick.  The heli-jet pulls away...then tilts 
violently to one side, engines desperately trying to compensate.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

The QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft, it's weight drawing it 
slowly down.  In the BACKGROUND, the Navigation Tower begins to slowly 
collapse.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls.

HIROKO
Shit!

BROKEN TUSK turns towards her.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
In the back!  In the back!

The PREDATOR may not understand her words, but he can follow the 
frantic jerking of her hand.  He twists around to look in the chopper's 
rear.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the station's storage tanks.  The 
conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand.

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The QUEEN is starting to struggle up, it's arms flailing for purchase.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear.  He quickly takes 
stock of it.

HIROKO
Watch your shots!  If you hit the engine you'll blow us both to hell!

BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger.  His index finger won't slide into 
the trigger guard...it's too big!  He takes the guard in both hands and 
exerts pressure.  SNAP.  Problem solved.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

BLEEP!  There's only one set of digits left on the destruct device's 
display counter.

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

A red dot of light runs across the QUEEN's head.  She must sense it 
somehow. Her head comes round to bear...

BROKEN TUSK's got the pulse-rifle trained right on her.

BROKEN TUSK
Chew...on...this...!

BLAM!  A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head.  She YOWLS.  
BLAM! A second round does the job.  The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and 
falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

The last segment of the destruct mechanism's display disappears.  We 
hear a

HIGH-PITCHED TONE.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO throws the joystick forward.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet accelerates hell-for-leather away.  An incandescent BALL 
OF ENERGY expands outward, vaporising the station and most of the 
surrounding bayou for about a mile's radius.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - PRE-DAWN

Big Bertha's parked by the blinking blue beacon tower, site of the ill-
fated hunting expedition.  About a dozen or so people are milling 
around, smoking cigarettes or talking.

MATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATT's crawler.  
They feel the concussive shock-wave, and look upward.

Their P.O.V. 
Above the treetops, a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon...

MATT
Holy shit!

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

Gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the 
turbulence out.

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

A chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the 
chopper's starboard engine.  There's a BURST of flame, then the 
extinguishers cut in.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet's bucking like a bronco now, and they're losing height 
rapidly.

HIROKO
We've lost the starboard engine!  We're going down!  Hold on!

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls.  
The glass cracks with the impact.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
Leaves, twigs, and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through 
the canopy of foliage.

EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH, 
spraying mud all around.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The canopy implodes.  A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit, 
spraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin.  She SCREAMS.

EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN

The chopper comes to rest in the swamp.  The SQUAWKING of the local 
WILDLIFE O.S. gradually dies down.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO moves her head, and GROANS.  There's a nasty gash across her 
forehead. She turns to BROKEN TUSK.  The door frame on his side is 
buckled and twisted. Part of the metal has sheared off, it's sharp end 
impaling him through the shoulder.  The PREDATOR coughs luminous green 
blood.

HIROKO
We've gotta get you out of here.

EXT.  SWAMP - DAWN

The sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to 
the other side.  She manages to get the mangled door open.  BROKEN 
TUSK's wound looks even worse up-close.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hold on.  This is gonna hurt some.

HIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSK's shoulder.  The PREDATOR braces 
himself, and starts to move.  The agony is excruciating; his mandibles 
open and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR.

HIROKO helps him out of the seat.  The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his 
feet. What happens next is totally unexpected.

BROKEN TUSK's throat BURSTS, fountaining green blood.  Shocked, HIROKO 
gets out of the path of the PREDATOR's tumbling mass.  She looks up.

The ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts it's 
sledgehammer tongue, it's head following her movements.

The PREDATOR's 'smart' weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying 
blade-down in the mire.  HIROKO scoops up, activating it and scrambling 
away.  She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her.

The ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet, and the two opponents 
face each other like sumo wrestlers.  HIROKO assumes a defensive 
stance, holding the disc ready to strike.  The ALIEN hisses, it's tail 
stinger coming around. It leaps for her, and battle is joined.  The 
ALIEN lashes out, but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and 
time again.  With each thrust, surgically thin wounds open up on the 
biomechanoid's body.  One of the ALIEN's attacks sends her reeling to 
the floor, it's stinger arching towards her.  She parries, slicing the 
tail in half and struggling to her feet.

The ALIEN strikes again.  HIROKO feints, then thrusts, lopping off one 
of it's hands.  The ALIEN HOWLS with pain, blinding lashing out at her 
and sending the 'smart' weapon flying from her grip.

She's lost, and the creature knows it.  It's lips curl into a SNARL.

KER-POW!  KER-POW!  The ALIEN's head DETONATES, and it's skeletal body 
slumps forward to SPLASH into the swamp...revealing BROKEN TUSK 
pointing the pulse
rifle.

The dying PREDATOR GURGLES, his head drooping.  HIROKO stumbles across 
to him.  BROKEN TUSK's in a bad way, green gore is pulsing freely from 
it's throat.  It gazes up at HIROKO.

BROKEN TUSK
Not...a pretty...sight...

And with that, the PREDATOR dies.

HIROKO look around.  The sun is rising above the treetops, and the 
setting is serene.  Somehow beautiful.

The speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life, jarring her.

VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Rimward Tracking Station, this is the one thirty-second Rim Corp 
Battalion operating out of the cruiser Tartarus from Fort Powell.  
Please respond.  Over.

There's a sound O.S., like a THUNDERCLAP.  HIROKO surveys the horizon.

HIROKO's P.O.V.  
A pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest, their 
weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects. Searchlights probe the 
ground far below.

A shadow falls over HIROKO, blocking out the sun.  A monstrous SHAPE 
occupies the air above, delineated only by a telltale vibration.  The 
PREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers it's cloaking device, extending landing 
gear and a ramp. It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper.

HIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out.  BROKEN TUSK's body is 
borne aloft and carried back inside.  The LEAD PREDATOR turns to 
HIROKO.  He crosses to her.  HIROKO's face is reflected in the faceted 
eyepieces of the PREDATOR's helmet.

The extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear.  KER-CHUNK!  
The tips lock into place.  The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO.  She 
accepts, a little confused.

There's a long moment.  The PREDATOR is still standing there.  Waiting. 
HIROKO's eyes narrow.  Her mind is working furiously.  What do they 
want?

She realises.  It suddenly becomes clear.  She smiles.

HIROKO
Yeah.  Why not.

HIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS, then walks around the 
waiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back.

The PREDATOR follows her.  The ramp SLAMS closed, as we...

CUT TO BLACK
THE END
Alien Resurrection 



EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.

We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes 
into view:

the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically 
just beyond Pluto's orbit.

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 

INT.  AURIGA

along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two 
guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful 
shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

INT.  MEDLAB

Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, 
lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 

As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, 
then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a 
Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.

Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass 
encased in a clear, aspic-like gel. 

Tubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine.

As we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can 
see what might even be a face.

Eyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming.

ANGLE: WHEAT.

A birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen.  
Sharp contrast to what we have seen before.

There is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven 
or eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair.

GIRL'S VOICE

My mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there 
are.

The girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her 
chest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see.

She looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty 
yards away.

The girl's expression becomes perplexed.

She slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, 
wriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more 
distraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout.

The sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another.  
She looks down in  growing horror and sees:

Blood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, 
a sea of blood now, dark, thick.

The girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely 
covered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she 
finally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth.

CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Instruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure.

Scientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic.

We can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the 
size of a man, and in a new case.

The camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a 
second one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLLWAY

Tiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning 
into another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving 
until we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of 
dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us...

ANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream 
it keeps shifting.

She opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless.

She reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard.

Tearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides.

CUT TO:

INT.  OPERATING CHAMBER

And the cause of this dream becomes apparant:

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST

being cut open with a lasersaw.

We see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it.  
And her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her 
face her identity is unmistakable.

Around her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a 
young and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands 
a bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN.

WREN

Careful ... ready with the amnio...

Gediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it.  
Pulls apart the chest.

GEDIMAN

There she is...

He says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a 
sleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at 
severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest.

GEDIMAN

Here we go.

He holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator 
filled with  amniotic fluid.

The alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of 
his grasp.

WREN

Watch it!

Everybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from 
him, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the 
top rapidly.

Everybody looks at each other for a moment.

GEDIMAN

Well ...

WREN

The host?

A surgeon looks at Ripley's readings.

SURGEON

Doing fine.

Gediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods.

WREN

Sew her back up.

Gediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the 
alien.

GEDIMAN

Well, that went as well as could be expected--

Ripley's hand LASHES OUT, GRABS the surgeon's forearm.  He yells in 
pain as her fingers dig into him, the others scramble knocking things 
over and we HEAR HIS BONE CRACKING.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. RIPLEY'S CELL

Sudden stillness.

Ripley crouches in the middle of a small, dark chamber.  She's wide 
eyed, staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia. Hair tangled 
and wild. But at least she's not so  blue as before.

The only light on her comes from directly above, from a thick pane of 
glass in the center of the ceiling.

ANGLE: ABOVE THE CELL

A guard stands on the floor above, looking into the cell through the 
square of glass in  the floor, directly above Ripley.

(We see other panes of glass lining the floor, indicating more cells 
below.)

ANGLE: RIPLEY

She is still for a long while.  Then she lifts her hands, looking at 
them.

Touches her face, her skin.

She fingers her tunic, pulls down the neck.  There is a scar running 
along her chest.

She fingers it thoughtfully. -

She looks at her forearm.  Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the 
number 8.

She looks up, her face unreadable.

CUT TO':

INT.  LAB

Ripley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her.

He deposits it in a test beaker, studies her eyes.

Wren enters, looking at a chart.

WREN

How's our number Eight today?

GEDIMAN:

Appears to be in good health...

WREN

(noticing his tone)

How good?

GEDIMAN

Extraordinary. As in, completely off our projected charts.

(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue.  See the recession?

WREN

This is from --

GEDIMAN

Yesterday!

WREN

This is good.  This is very good.

GEDIMAN

I'd like to run some tests: strength, coordination...  We're not 
looking at a normal cloning arc.

WREN:

Approved.

Wren goes up to Ripley, studies her face with satisfaction.

WREN

Well, it looks like you're going to make us all very proud.

She grabs his throat with dazzling speed, applying deadly pressure as 
she  brings his face to hers.  Her eyes are burn but lost.

RIPLEY

Why?

GEDIMAN

Oh my God...

He is as wide eyed as WREN, and he isn't having his windpipe crushed.

After a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the 
alarm.

Klaxons, red light fire up.

A guard rushes in, levels his weapon at Ripley.  After a moment of 
staring him down, she opens her hand.  Wren falls to his knees gasping.

The guard FIRES his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes 
out and sends her flying back into the corner.

WREN

No! No! I'm all right!

The guards keep their weapons -- 'burners', these shockrifles are 
called -- leveled  at Ripley. She has recovered from the shock quickly, 
sits crumpled in the corner, looking at nothing in particular.

RIPLEY (wearily)

Why...?

CUT TO:

INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM

Wren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests 
Ripley.

With them is General PEREZ, the man in charge this boat. Ramrod 
straight and about  as gruff as you would expect, he stares at Ripley 
suspiciously.

ANGLE: RIPLEY

The scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them: house, dog, 
boat.

Ripley gives answers we can't hear through the glass, looking pissed 
off and bored.

WREN

It's unprecedented.

GEDIMAN

Totally!  She's operating at a completely adult capacity.

PEREZ

And her memories?

WREN

There are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance.

GEDIMAN

She's freaked.

Wren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance.

WREN

"It" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional 
autism.

Certain reactions....

Perez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall.

TO:

INT HALL - CONTINUOUS

The two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second 
observation room.

GEDIMAN:

But the thing is, we can't terminate her. It.

PEREZ

You haven't told me what you think has caused this.

Cloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought 
to adult term.  I'm right?

GEDIMAN

There's been cases..

PEREZ

Not like this.

WREN

Well, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a 
collective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like 
instinct, only  more complex structurally.

PEREZ

In some cases. You're talking about the alien.

WREN

Yes.

PEREZ

You promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing.

WREN

It's not like the other ones..

Perez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second 
observation room door opens..	

He steps in, the other two right behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM TWO

Darker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards 
by the door.

Apart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others.

PEREZ

But there is some genetic mix.

WREN

Yes.

PEREZ

Will there be further mutation?

GEDIMAN

Mutation isn't exactly... I don't think so.

WREN

That's one of the things we need to study.

PEREZ

All right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for 
God's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises.

And as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the 
ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at 
the back of his head.

The reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, 
stops it.

As it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the 
alien's face.

Its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off.

Perez turns to look at it with the others.

PEREZ

It took a hell of a lot to get us here.

GEDIMAN

No shit.

Wren shoots him another look.

PEREZ

How soon before this one's ovulating?

WREN

Days.

PEREZ

Is that normal?

WREN

No way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated.

(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies.

PEREZ

They're coming.  Soon.

CUT TO:

INT. MESS HALL

Ripley sits across from Gediman. He is eating at a good pace - Ripley, 
however, has stopped.  She is staring at her fork, her brows furrowed.  
Turns it over in her hand, in her mind.

GEDIMAN

"Fork."

The memory comes, and she shakes her head wearily.

RIPLEY (softly)

Fuck....

GEDIMAN (pretending to correct her)

"Fork."

Ever so slightly, she smiles. The smile fades, and after a moment:

RIPLEY

How did you...

GEDIMAN

How did we get you?  Blood samples from Fiori 16. On ice. 

Do you remember that place?

RIPLEY

Does it grow?

GEDIMAN

Does it.....Yeah. Rapidly.

RIPLEY

It's a queen.

GEDIMAN

How did you know that?

RIPLEY

It'll breed.  You'll die.  Everyone in the ... fucking.... (searches 
for the word, then spits it out) ... Company.  Will die.

GEDIMAN

Company?

WREN (O.S.)

Weyland Yutani.

He has entered behind her, comes up to the table.

WREN

Our Ripley's former employers.  Terran Growth conglom, had some defense 
contracts  under the military. Before your time, Gediman -- they went 
under decades ago, bought out by Walmart.  Fortunes of war.

(to Ripley)

You'll find things have changed a good deal since your time.

RIPLEY

1 doubt that.

WREN

We're not flying blind here, you know.  This is United Systems 
military, not some greedy corporation. The potential benefits of this 
race go way beyond urban pacification.

New alloys, new vaccines ... there's nothing like this in any world 
we've seen.  

You should be very proud.

She laughs, bitterly.

RIPLEY

Oh, I am.

WREN

And the animal itself is wonderous. They'll be invaluable once we've 
harnessed them.

RIPLEY

It's a cancer.  You can't teach it tricks.

This stops Wren, and he retreats silently.  Ripley repeats word to 
herself, thinking.

RIPLEY

"Them" ...

CUT TO:

INT.  HALL   CONTINUOUS

As Wren is leaving the mess, he is accosted by an ensign.

ENSIGN

Doctor, General Perez is asking for you. We've been hailed.

CUT TO:

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

We see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME, 
heading for it.  

A small vessel, it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is 
pristine.  

To accentuate the difference, the sudden roar of its engines is 
accompanied by 

HEAVY, THRASHING ROCK MUSIC.

CUT TO:

INT.  COCKPIT    CONTINUOUS

The music is coming from nearby.  Piloting the ship toward the Auriga 
is HILLARD, a roughskinned woman in her forties, along with RANE, a 
slight and quiet fellow.

Behind them stands ELGYN, the leader of the group.

Has the kind of authority that doesn't need to flaunt itself.

Maybe fifty, by the silver in his hair. He speaks into the vidcom

ELGYN

(good naturedly)

My authorization code is 'fuck you', son.  Now open the goddamn bay or 
General Perez  is gonna do a Wichita stomp on your virgin ass.

He switches off.

RANE

Wichita stomp?

ELGYN

I guarantee that boy's. Never seen the inside of a woman.

(to Hillard)

Bring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel.

HILLARD

Darlin', it's done.

ELGYN

Don't cut thrust till six hundred meters. Give em a little fright.

He puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he 
exits.

They're more than friends.

He moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle.

ELGYN

Christie!  St Just!  Rise and shine. We're docking.

He proceeds into:

INT.  CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

It's the largest space in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most 
of the space are two HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly 
the size of winnebagos.

As Elgyn enters, we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of 
them.

She's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth 
and prettiness.

ELGYN

Call!  CALL!

The music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner.  

Elgyn switches it off.

ELGYN

Call!

CALL

What?

ELGYN

We're docking! Are the cargo trucks secured?

CALL

I checked 'em an hour ago.

ELGYN

I don't want em so much as rattled. Any leakage, I take it out of your 
hide.

CALL

Trust me, boss.

ELGYN (laughs)

Not my style.

He leans down, looks under the thresher.  Lying on a gurneylike steel 
dolly, working under the machine, is VRIESS, chie mechanic.  Late 
forties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs.

ELGYN

How's it looking?

VRIESS  It's never gonna be pretty. but she'll fly.  The other one's a 
total fucking write-off.

ELGYN

You'll make it good.

VRIESS

Don't be so sure.

(calls out) Call!  Adjust the generator plugs!

ELGYN (straightening up)

They just gotta run, Vriess.  They don't gotta run far.

He exits.

CUT TO: INT. HALL   CONTINTJOUS

CHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has 
distinctly military bearing. He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me 
authority.

CHRISTIE

What's our status?

ELGYN

We're coming in.  Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality.

ST JUST

Oh great.  Army food..

ST JUST ("San-Jhoost") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool.  

Moves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips.  He is 
strapping a contraption to his forearm.  It resembles a deringer 
holder, but a very complex one.

ELGYN: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get 
those harvesters on their feet.

This'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are 
friendly.

CHRISTIE

We expecting any trouble?

ELGYN

From Perez? I doubt it. Still, let's be ever vigilant.

CUT TO: INT.  CARGO BAY     CONTNIUOUS

ANGLE: VRIESS working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the 
thresher inches above his head.

VRIESS

I'm patched in. Check the sequence timer.

(no answer)

Call?

ANGLE: THE CONTROLS

A hand reaches in toward the ON switch.

ANGLE: VRIESS

VRIESS

Call?

The thresher GRINDS TO LIFE -- a hundred blades and claws spinning at 
Vriess's head!

Vriess wheels out from under the machine in a second flat.

VRIESS

Goddamnit!

The second he's out he hits a lever and the back of the dolly flies up, 
transforming it-into a wheelchair.

VRIESS  Johner! You son of a whore!

JOHNER jumps down from the machine, laughing.  He's thickset, mean and 
ugly, with ugly scars crisscrossing his ugly bald head.

Thought I'd give you a little haircut there.

VRIESS

You fuck!

Call, who has been over on the other side of the thresher, ably climbs 
up on it  and switches it off.

JOHNER

You should see your face. Vriess, you must have soiled yourself.

VRIESS One of these days I'm gonna kill you. My hand to God.

JOHNER

Well, you already gave him your feet ...

CALL (jumping down)

You're a limp fucking scrotum, you know that?

JOHNER

Either of you want a piece of me, I'm less than busy.

VRIESS

Any time.

CALL

Vriess. Forget it. He's been sucking down too much homebrew.

JOHNER

Don't push me, little Annalee.  You hang with us a while, you'll learn 
I'm not the man with whom to fuck.

He exits, full of annoying bravado.

VRIESS

That inbred cocksucker.

He feels his forehead, comes up with a bit of blood.  Realizes how 
close it was ...

Call looks up at the thresher.

CALL

1 hate machines.

VRIESS

Well, now we know it works ...

CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA DOCKING BAY

As it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship.  The bay on the 
bottom of the Auriga 

- the doors are actually OVER the ship, which rises into the airlock.

INT.  AIR LOCK

The outer doors close under the ship.  Pressurized air shoot into the 
airlock for a few seconds, and then the inner door opens. the ship 
rising into the bay.

INT.  BAY

The ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end.  
The top of  the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs 
the length of the bay.

Three soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform. The hatch 
atop the ship slowly  opens. One by one the crew files out. Seeing them 
en masse, we get a clearer view of  what separates them from this 
Environment.  They're not wearing uniforms.  They're an  eclectic, 
fiercely indivualist group, their look varied -- spots of bright color 
showing  through militarian space gear.  Johner's bright tuorquise 
bowling shirt.  Elgy's and St Just's floorlength leather dusters.  Even 
Vriess's chair stands out as he wheels down the platform.

What they have in common is the toughness, the wary eyes, leathery 
skin.  The cool readiness to kill.  These guys are smugglers.  A long 
while ago, you'd have called them pirates

All eight of them emerge, one by one, looking around them.  They file 
past the silent, uniformed soldiers.  The last one suddenly puts a hand 
on Johner's jacket, stops him.

There is a bulge under it.  A green sensor light on the back of the 
soldier's glove turns  red when he touches the bulge.

SOLDIER

No projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel, sir.

Johner opens his jacket, shows what he's packing: a large thermos.

JOHNER

Moonshine. My own. Much more dangerous.

SOLDIER

Sorry, sir.

ELGYN (to Perez)

What, do you think we're going to hijack the vessel?  All eight of us?

No, I think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a 
bullet through  the hull. we are in space, Elgyn.

He enters from the antechamber, motions for the crew to follow him. 

Vriess comes abreast of the soldier.

VRIESS

Wanna check the chair?

The soldier makes no response, simply falls in behind Call, the last of 
them.

CUT TO:  INT.  ANTECHAMBER

The long neck that connects the bay to the body of the ship.  The group 
proceeds down it, the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur.

ST JUST

This place is really clean.

JOHNER (to a guard)

Hey.  You got any whores on this vessel?

(the guard remains stonefaced)

Any loose women with bad eyesight?

PEREZ

I think you'll find our accomodations somewhat spartan.  Although the 
cook sets a good-table.

JOHNER: That ain't what I'm hungry for.

VRIESS (to Call)

What's the matter?

She is looking around her, somewhat tensely.

CALL

I don't like army.

HILLARD

Yeah, join the fucking club.

CUT TO: ANGLE: MONEY

A stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another.  They're green, 
and identifiably money. But they're square, about the size of cocktail 
napkins.  The face on them is  unfamiliar.  Thousand dollar bills.

WIDER ANGLE: INT.  PEREZIS CHAMBERS    LATER

A good sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion. Perez is 
behind his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn.

PEREZ

This wasn't easy to come by.

ELGYN

Neither was our cargo. You're not pleading poverty, are you?

PEREZ

We're well funded. I mean the bills. There's not many that still deal 
in coin.

ELGYN

Just the ones that don't like their every transaction recorded. The 
fringe element.

I guess that would include you, though, wouldn't it?

PEREZ

Drink?

ELGYN

Constantly.  I'm guessing whatever you've got going here wasn't exactly 
approved by congress.

Perez pours two whiskeys.

PEREZ (changing the subject)

So where do you go from here?

ELGYN

Out by the Handle.  We've got a couple of harvesters, we can unload 'em 
on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get 'em working.

PEREZ

Call.  Where'd you find her?

ELGYN

She is severely fuckable, isn't she? - And the very devil with a socket 
wrench.

I think Vriess somewhat pines.

He takes a stack of bill, smells it.  He likes the smell.-

ELGYN

She is curious about this little transaction.  You can hardly blame 
her, Awfully cloak and  dagger...

Perez hands a drink to ELGYN.

PEREZ

This is an army operation.

ELGYN

Most army research labs don't have to operate outside regulated space.

And they don't call for the kind of cargo we brought.

PEREZ

Do you want something, Elgyn?

ELGYN

Just bed and board, couple of days worth.  If we're not imposing.

PEREZ

Not at all. Keep out of the restricted areas, don't start any fights, 
and mi casa is yours too.

Elgyn drinks to that.

PEREZ

I trust, of course, that you can mind your own business.

ELGYN (smiles)

I'm famous for it.

They drink. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

The 'cargo' is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it. It is 
wheeled into:

INT.  A CHAMBER

Where Wren and a few others are waiting.  Gediman looks a little 
nervous, not sure this is a good idea.

The cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the 
electric lock.

It springs open and the guard slides off a side panel.

They are stacked one on the other, five of them in all, cryotubes. 
People sleeping inside.

One by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second 
unit is wheeled in.

By the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in 
the dark chamber.

The scientists meanwhile retire to INT.  AN ADJOINING CHAMBER with a 
long glass window looking at the chamber.

The last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock 
behind them.

Wren starts pushing buttons.

The glass tops of the cryotubes slide open.  We see temperature and 
lifesign gauges begin to change..

There is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes 
lowers, lowers,  and rotates slowly.

Stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs.  The ceiling rotates 
just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers.

For a moment nothing happens.

One of the sleepers eyes flutter slightly. Opens. All ten eggs open 
simultaneously.

CUT TO: INT.  CONFERENCE HALL

A huge room, used for assemblies and events. It has a chain basketball 
net set up at one end, crude court lines taped to the floor.  Ripley 
stands beneath the net with a ball, dribbling absently.

At the other end are set up tables and folding chairs.  The crew of the 
Betty, sans Elgyn, are filing in to eat here.  Johner spies Ripley, 
smiles.

JOHNER

Ooh.

Johner comes up to Ripley.  Her expression makes it clear how much she 
enjoys having him in her face.

JOHNER

How about a little one on one?

She keeps dribbling, says nothing.

JOHNER

What do you say?

RIPLEY

Get away from me.

JOHNER

Why should I?

RIPLEY

Because pain hurts.

He falters a moment at her quiet threat, then:

JOHNER Are you gonna hurt me then? 1 think I might enjoy that.

He smiles his ugly smile. She smiles back.

She hits, him solidly in the chest -- and he flies back ten feet, 
landing badly on a group of chairs.

His mates fly into action, Christie grabs a standing ashtray. Hillard 
jumps Ripley from behind.   She throws her off with e -- chucks the 
basketball at her hard enough to pop the air out of it.

Christie swings at her and SMASHES her right in the face.

She arcs back... and right back up, at Christie's throat before he has 
a chance to react, squeezing, batting away the ashtray just a trickle 
of blood coming down her nose --

Johner cames at her again and she leaps on him, throws him to the 
ground, snarling,

SHE'S GONNA RIP HIS THROAT OUT WITH HER TEETH.

WREN

Ripley.

Ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her.  Wren and 
Gediman behind them.

Call, standing to one side with Vriess, reacts visibly to the name.  
Everybody is slowly backing off.  St Just stands with his hands behind 
his back, as if concealing something.

Call watches in rapt silence.

WREN

Don't let's have a scene.

Ripley lets go of Johner, stands.

RIPLEY

He... smells

WREN

I imagine he does.

JOHNER (barely breathing)

What the fuck are you?

She looks down on him - in both senses of the phrase. - Look around at 
everyone staring at her.

She wipes the bit of blood from under her nose, flicks it away. Exits.

WREN (to Gediman, amused)

Social skills, less than a hundred' percent.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S BLOOD

The few drops she flicked away sizzle on the floor -- not eating 
through, but melting  a small patch.

TO: INT.  LABS - LATER

A large metal box is being wheeled next to an observation pen. Soldiers 
surround it, weapons at the ready.  Not one of them at ease.

Wren and Gediman watch intently.

WREN

What's the status on the Queen?

GEDIMAN

We still haven't detected the origin of the reproductive anomalies. But 
the egg laying  stage appears to be over.

WREN

Did we do something wrong?

GEDIMAN

I don't know. I think we covered everything. But these redundancies...

A soldier lifts a panel in the pen and then doors to the cage come open 
automatically.

Everyone waits.

A fullgrown alien suddenly bolts into the pen. The soldier shut it as 
quickly as humanly possible.

WREN

Father, check security status, observation pen six.

Father, the voice of the ship, replies after a moment in a dulcet, 
comforting tone.

FATHER

Pen six secure, security systems functional at 100%.

WREN

Good.  Now the others.

CUT TO: INT.  SLEEP CHAMBERS - NIGHT

We see VARIOUS ANGLES of people at night:

Rane, in, a chamber on the Auriga.

Hillard and Elgyn, in a slightly more lush one.

Perez, in his quarters.

VRIESS, rolling about the Aurigals engine room, looking it over.

Christie, St Just, Call and Johner, all playing poker in the mess hall.

CUT TO:  INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM - RIGHT

A sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near 
emptiness of the room.

Gediman alone is in here, writing observations down in a notebook as he 
watches the pen.

Inside are three aliens. Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up 
in the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and 
hissing at it. 

Gediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the 
beast's.  It draws back its lips, opens its mouth.  The metallic tongue 
issues slowly forth, dripping with slime.

GEDIMAN (softly, fascinated)

Is that a distended externus lingua ... or are you just happy to see 
me?

The creature hisses. retracts the tongue. Gediman scribbles few notes.

Something moves in the dark behind him. Before he can notice, a hand 
closes on his shoulder.

It's Ripley. She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage. Gediman seems 
only mildly surprised.

GEDIMAN

How did you get in here?

RIPLEY

Beautiful, aren't they?

GEDIMAN

Yes.  Yes they are.  I've been monitoring their interaction.

He points at a audiograph by the wall, blips and waves interrupting the 
vibrating line, indicating sound.

He notices that her hand is still on her shoulder.

GEDIMAN

They communicate.  Through ultrasonic soundwaves.  Sort of like bats.

RIPLEY

I know.

She looks at him.

RIPLEY

I can hear them.

GEDIMAN (smiling)

Amazing ...

She runs her hand through the back of his hair, gently urging him up 
off his chair.

GEDIMAN

Ripley...

RIPLEY

Shhhhh.

She pulls him close, kisses him.  Lightly at first, then deeply - 
holding his head with both hands. He responds with surprising warmth, 
the kiss drawing out, pulling slowly apart.

She looks at him, smiles.

An alien tongue SHOOTS out of her mouth, burying itself in his face.

SMASH CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CHAMBER

As she suddenly awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard.

She has been sleeping, we see, in the same position she was before: 
squatting in the middle of the room. She looks about her, recovering 
from the nightmare... Her breathing slows. With a somewhat fatalistic 
look, she settles back to sleep.

CUT TO: INTERIOR MESS HALL - NIGHT

Christie, Call, St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker 
game, stacks of bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table.

They are in a tense hand, the pot impressively high.

JOHNER

I'm in.

CHRISTIE

All right.

ST JUST

Raise you two hundred.

JOHNER

Oh, fuck you!

CALL

That's it. I'm out. I'm fucked.

She throws down her cards, takes a swig of Johner's patented moonshine. 
It tastes horrible.

CHRISTIE

That takes me down, too. Johner?

JOHNER

Uh, Uh, fuck it. I fold.

(to St Just)

What do-you got?

St Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck.

ST JUST

You'll always wonder.

JOHNER

You asshole.

CHRISTIE

Johner, your deal.

CALL

Deal me out. It's not my night.

She tries to stand up, takes a spill over her chair.  The others laugh.

CALL

Jesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit, battery acid?

JOHNER

Just for coloring.

ST JUST (producing a small vial)

I got something that'll take the edge off that.

CALL  Thanks, I'll walk it off.

She stumbles out of the room.  Johner shuffles the deck.

JOHNER

Bitches should not play with the boys, they will get cleaned out.

(dealing)

Eight card throwback, fuck your sister and the sevens are wild.

CUT TO: INT.  HALL

As soon as she is out of sight, Call straightens up, completely sober.  
She looks around her and takes off toward the restricted areas.

She comes to the door and making sure no one is around, star punching 
in code on the keypad.

CUT TO: INT.  CELLBLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

As Call pads silently down it, looking for one cell.

TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

The cell door opens silently.  Call hesitates a moment, then slips in, 
shutting the door behind her.

Ripley is sleeping, still in the squatting position in the middle of 
the room. 

Call approaches.

She stares down at Ripley a moment.  A shadow passes as a guard walks 
above them,

Call tenses till he is gone.  Look's back down at Ripley -- still 
sleeping.

Call extends her hand, flexes her wrist.  The meanest lookin stilletto 
you've ever seen extends from out her sleeve. it, gotta be a foot long, 
and sharp enough to shave with.

She lifts back her arm, the better to punch it through Ripley's heart.

Ripley shifts slightly.  Call stops.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST

Her shirt is open enough to show a good portion of the scar. Call 
hesitates, staring, realization flooding her face.

RIPLEY

Well?

Call starts, moving back a pace.

RIPLEY

You gonna kill me or what?

CALL

There's no point, is there?

A flick of her wrist and the stilletto whips back up her sleeve.  
Ripley sits up.

CALL

It's already out of you.  Christ... Is it here?  Is it on board?

RIPLEY (smiling)

You mean my baby?  CALL

I don't understand.  If they've got it, why are they keeping you alive?

RIPLEY

Curious.  I'm the latest thing...

CALL

Those sick fucks.

She raises her arm, the stilletto gliding out again.

CALL

I can make it stop.  The pain... this nightmare.. That's all I can 
offer you.

Ripley holds her palm up, presses it against the point of the blade.

RIPLEY

What makes you think I would let you do that?

Ripley pushes her hand out - the blade goes RIGHT THROUGH HER PALM. She 
keeps pushing her hand out slowly, a good five inches of the blade 
sticking out the back of her hand  before she stops. Call stares at 
her.

CALL

What are you?

RIPLEY

Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant first class, number 36706.

CALL

Ellen Ripley died two hundred years ago.

Ripley pulls her hand back suddenly, grimacing at the pain.

RIPLEY

What do you know about it?

CALL

I've read Morse -- I've read all the banned histories.  She gave her 
life to protect us from the beast.  You're not her.

RIPLEY

If I'm not her. What am I?

CALL

You're a thing.  A construct.  They grew you in a fucking lab.

RIPLEY

But only God can make a tree.

CALL

And now they've brought the beast out of you.

RIPLEY (smiling)

Not all the way out.

CALL

What?

RIPLEY

It's in my head.  Behind my eyes.  I can hear it moving.  The beast.

The smile is gone, some real vulnerability showing through.  Call 
softens, trying a different tack.

CALL

Help me.  If there's anything human in you at all, help me stop them 
before  this thing gets loose.

RIPLEY

It's already loose.

Call's expression changes.  Those words terrify her, but she's not sure 
if Ripley means what she thinks.

Ripley raises her hand at Call's head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops 
a few inches away.

Then touches her forehead gently, almost sensually.

RIPLEY

Once the thought .... the hope for it ... grows here.... it has found 
its way.

It will come, because... man will bring it.  Bring it forth.

CALL

You want that.

RIPLEY

I've come to terms with the fact of it. It's inevitable.

CALL

Not so long as there's breath-in me.

Ripley LASHES OUT and GRABS CALL'S THROAT.  Call swings wit the blade 
but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect.  Ripley squeezes 
the girls neck.

Ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness.

RIPLEY

I can... make it ... stop...

Call's eyes are pleading, terrified. Ripley finally lets go and she 
drops to the ground gasping for air.  RIPLEY

Go. They're coming for you.

As soon as she can move, Call scrambles up and heads out.

CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS

Call comes out and before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head.  
She goes down but  not out as two guards grab her. Wren is with them 
and three more.

WREN

I think you're gonna find that this was ill advised.

(to the men) Where are her friends?

GUARD

Mess hall, most of them.

WREN

Sound the alarm. I want them rounded up. Now!

TO: INT.  MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE: THE CARD TABLE

Being kicked over.

Elgyn, Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room, sleepy and confused.

Christie, St Just, and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers.

Call is thrown into the group as well.

ELGYN

What the fuck is going on here?

CHRISTIE

Looks like a doublecross, boss.

WREN

Where's the other one? With the chair?

JOHNER (to a soldier)

Get your fucking hands off me!

ELGYN

Do you mind telling me what the fuck you're up to?

WREN

Shut up! 

(to a guard) Get the general.  Wake him up.

ELGYN

Look, if there's a problem tell me what it is. We can work this out, 
there is no  need to get emotional ...

St Just is silent, standing in the same position he was when Ripley 
attacked Johner.

Hands behind his back.

ANGLE: BEHIND ST JUST'S BACK

As Elgyn speaks, two guns..slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands.

CALL

They got nothing to do with this, Wren.

ELGYN (to Call)

To do with what?

WREN  I don't give a fuck. It's way too late for that. You're all 
looking at a firing squad.

You hear me?

ELGYN

I do.  St Just?

With lighting precision, St Just raises his hands and blows of the 
guards away.

He takes out a third to his left without even looking that way.

One guard gets off a shot with his burner, frying Rane before Hillard's 
elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat.

Christie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of 
his thermos --  the top half flies off, revealing handle of a gun 
inside. He grabs it and another  guard runs. Johner doesn't have time 
to pull the gun-out of the the so he SHOOTS right through it, sending 
the guard flying..

CUT TO: INT.  ALIEN OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS

Alarms, flashing red lights.  Gediman looking in a video monitor.

GEDIMAN

What the fuck... You three!  Go! Sector two.

All but one of the guards rush out to investigate.  Gediman works the 
surveilliance screen, trying to see what's happening

CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

When the smoke clears, There are two guards still standing.  They point 
their weapons inneffectually.  St Just a has gun to wren's head and a 
gun on the guards, who are also covered by Johner.

ELGYN

Nice and easy, boys ...

Call starts to take off.

CALL

I'm gonna finish this.

Elgyn grabs her by the hair, roughly pulls her back.

ELGYN

You're going nowhere, Annalee.

CUT TO: INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: IN THE PEN

The three aliens have picked up the energy. are stalking back and forth 
like tigers in the dim light of their pen.

ANGLE: THEIR POV

We see Gediman and the guard, their backs to us. The aliens-stop 
pacing.  One of them,  to the right, looks at the one on the left.  
Something passes between them. They look back at the humans.  At each 
other.

They SET ON the middle alien, TEARING IT APART.  It lets out piercing, 
insectile SHRIEKS as they tear it limb from limb.

Gediman spins in terror, the guard bringing up his weapon. Gediman hits 
the lights inside the pen and as they blink to shocking brightness we 
see:

The remains of the third alien on the ground as a giant pool its blood 
EATS A HOLE IN THE FLOOR.

GEDIMAN

Oh, God

He bolts for the failsafe but it's too late as the blood eats all the 
way through  - the two aliens DIVE through the hole. just as Gediman 
hits the button -- freezing gas  fills the chamber but there's nothing 
to freeze.

GEDIMAN

No no no!

He hits another sequence and the door slides open.  He rushes in, 
kneels by the hole and looks down.

ANGLE: HIS POV

Their blood has already eaten through two levels.

GEDIMAN

Christ.  They could be anywhere.

He looks up at the guard -- and an alien FLIES UP at him through the 
hole.  

It was hanging on the ceiling below and it pulls him through before he 
can breathe a decent scream.

The guard just stares, shaking.

CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL

The mexican standoff is getting even more heated.

CHRISTIE

Who gives a shit!  We have to get out of here.

ELGYN

If Call's got something going here I want to know what it is!

WREN

You brought her here..

Two more guards rush in.  Johner shoves' his gun in Wren's mouth.

JOHNER

Drop them!  I'm not fucking with you!

CHRISTIE (indicating the dead soldiers)

Boss, we got bodies here.  It doesn't matter what Call's up to, we're 
all fucked now.

CALL

I have to stop him.  If I don't we'll all die.

WREN (pulls his mouth away)

Elgyn, tell me what you know. If she's alone in this.

HILLARD

In what?

Johner puts his gun to Call's temple now.

JOHNER

Does anyone want me to make this simple?

Far away, a SCREAM. Everyone stops.  Wren turns slowly in the direction 
it came from.

WREN

No...

CUT TO: INT.  HALLWAY BY LABS

A technican RUNS screaming just as an alien LEAPS on him from behind.  
The CAMERA  RUSHES AWAY, frenzied as the scene, to pick up a guard in 
the next hall firing wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up 
an airvent.  There are three bodies lying dead before us.

ANGLE: IN THE PENS

We see that the aliens have been freed.  Smoke, dead bodies, the 
plexiglass partition to one 1 cage is cracked and open.

CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

Ripley sits in the dark, the noise of Chaos just beginning filter in.  
And she just can't help herself.

She is LAUGHING.

CUT TO: INT.  PEREZ'S QUARTERS CONTINUOUS

He is mostly dressed, still shaking off sleep.  He stands at the 
command console, bringing up visual.  Everything on the screens is 
smoke and noise.

PEREZ

Ensign! Damage Report! Ensign!

Nothing.  On one of the screens, an alien is briefly visible. Perez 
stiffens at the sight of it.

He punches up a different sector. The labs, and here is a badly wounded 
lieutenant.

PEREZ

Status!

LIEUTENANT

Containment is impossible, sir... I think they swept the barracks.

PEREZ (to himself)

A military strike.... Christ Jesus ...

After a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes.

CUT TO: INT.  BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

It's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their 
sleep, and everyone awake is screaming.  One soldier runs for the 
weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into 
it, falling in a tumble of guns.

Over the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an 
airplane's indicating the nearest exit.  Father's voice is 
excruciatingly calm:

FATHER

Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. All hands. This 
is not a drill.

One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong 
with two of his friends.

They're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily.  It 
bounds forward, takes out his face.

FATHER

Emergency.  Initiate evacuation procedures ...

CUT TO..

INT. HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning 
voice and the emergency lighting are on.

Vriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned.  He spins slowly, 
checking out his surroundings.

ANGLE: DOWN THE HALL

There is nothing.. Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards 
the exit.

Vriess follows their lead, wheeling out.

CUT TO: INT.  NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Nothing here either. But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, 
carefully.

And was that a noise?  He looks around, up at the ceiling.

A drop of alien blood is eating through right above him.  It drips down 
-- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops 
to the floor, eating casually through.

CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS

Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats.  They sit facing each other 
in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in.  Pere is here, hurrying 
the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after.

PEREZ

Bay three!  Go!

The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch.  He 
hits the eject button and steps back.

CUT TO: EXT.  THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS

As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft.

CUT TO: INT.  BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS

Men crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly 
LEAPS into it.. starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are 
screaming.

Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, 
hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the 
alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade. 
The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button.

TO: EXT.  AURIGA - CONTINUOUS

The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.  EXPLODES.

CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all 
around the group.

Father's voice still urges evacuaticion

WREN

NO!

(to Call)

What have you done?

CALL

Nothing.  Not a goddanm thing. You thought you could control it.

ELGYN

All right. We make for the Betty. Can he walk?

He is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing.

HILLARD  Betty's all the way across the ship! Who knows what's in 
between?

CALL (indicating Wren)

He does.

One of the soldiers steps forward.  DiStephano.

DISTEPHANO (to Wren)

Sir, we have to go.

(to Elgyn) Let him go.  No quarrel.

ELGYN

You can have him when we're off. Not before.

They start out, dragging Wren along.  Guns still on Call and the 
soldiers.

What about Vriess?

JOHNER

Fuck Vriess!

CUT TO INT.  FALL - CONTINUOUS

Vries enters, looking around.  He is getting seriously wigged.

The lights on the floor still pulse. Urging him forward.  He obeys.

Something stirs in the rafters.  Coiled about the pipes.

Vriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast.  Strains to see.

It starts MOVING, climbing at him upside down on the pipes.  FAST.

Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly 
compared to the beast.

He turns the corner, spins around.

The hall is fifty feet long.  At the far end a few soldiers running 
through.

SERGEANT

Seal off that sector!

A soldier runs to obey, working the door controls.

VRIESS

No!

The soldier sees him, but the fear on the boy's face telegraphs his-
decision.

Vreiess starts pumping toward the door.  He's strong, picking up speed, 
but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him.

Vriess can't even look back as the thing gains on him.  The door begins 
to come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off.

Vriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for him

An EXPLOSION far away ROCKS THE SHIP -- the hall tilted momentarily, 
Vriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, 
the door closing, too low for him to clear. He gets there and SLAMS a 
lever, his chair FLATTENS out to a dolly  position, his head just 
CLEARS the closing door as the alien SLAMS into it, Vriess spinning out 
and flying off the chair it tilts, landing in a heap next to him.

Lying still on the ground, he listens as the beast slams against the 
door a few more times, then fades off.

VRIESS

Fuck everything....

He reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a 
shotgun.

CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY 5 - CONTINUOUS

Perez is trying to maintain order. He is failing. Grabs a corporal.

PEREZ

Muster a squad to search for survivors!

CORPORAL

Fuck no! Fuck no! Fuck you!

Perez slams him to the ground with his fist.

An ALIEN LEAPS OUT at him from the ceiling. The soldiers scatter, Perez 
just leaping out of the way --

PEREZ

Shoot it! Fry it!

A couple of men fire their burners, to little effect.

One soldier runs up to the action. His head is bloodied, his expression 
vengefully grim.

The soldier whips out a pistol, private.issue, he takes a bead on the 
thing --

PEREZ

NO!

And the soldier FIRES -- pumps three bullets into the beast sends it 
flying back toward the window.

Perez is riveted by the sight of: ANGLE: DROPS OF BLOOD

big ones, hitting the window. Everything seems to move slowly now - the 
alien,  struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it, the 
other soldiers, Perez -- the monster falls and the BLOOD EATS THROUGH 
THE WINDOW..

PEREZ

Get out!  Everyone!  Now!

Soldiers are beginning to get it.. The window CRACKS, begins to SHAKE 
as the blood is almost through it.

Even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped, his face frozen in 
horror at what he's about to accomplish.

Perez shoves him, herds the rest out, looking back --

PEREZ

Clear the sector!

at the window, the blood is almost through --

Men are pouring out of the hall -- some move down a side hall and SLAM 
the door shut  behind them, but most are making for the main exit 
anyway.

FATHER

Warning.  Potential hullbreach.  Clear sector.

The blood eats a hole in the window -- the nearest soldier is sucked 
back against the  window -- he SCREAMS as he is sucked through a hole 
no bigger than his fist.

Still men are falling over each other, Perez herding them out. 

A huge CRACKING sound, and Perez shuts his eyes.

The window explodes outward, the air blowing everything int space. 
Debris, vehicles, men, all tangled and dead as they blown out into the 
black.

ANGLE: THE SECTOR DOORS

SLAM shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out.

ANGLE: AIR VENTS

Gates slam down here as well.

ANGLE: ELECTRICAL DUCTS

Foam SHOOTS into them, hardening instantly, sealing the breached 
sector.

FATHER

Breach contained. Sector five nonfunctional.

CUT TO: INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

As the crew moves quickly through.  They come to a shut door, red 
lights along it indicating it's locked.

ELGYN (to DiStephano)

Open it.

DISTEPHMO

I can't.

Johner puts his gun to the soldier's head.

WREN

He can't!  The sector's closed.  The hull's been breached!

ELGYN

Okay, which way?

WREN

We'll have to go through the holding cells.  Here.

ELGYN

All right.

They turn left, entering

INT.  CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

that leads to the holding cells.  The room is big, a railing at one end 
looking over another chamber two flights down.

A shut door separates the chamber from the cells.

ELGYN

Can you get that one open?

It comes from the rafters, dropping down on Elgyn in a heartbeat.  He 
barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back 
of his skull.

Hillard has time.  She SCREAMS as her lover's brains come out his 
mouth.

The beast leaps at the group, scattering them like bowling pins as it 
claws into one of the guards. Everybody else is scrambling for cover.

St Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes 
out, tangling his feet and tripping him up, his head smashing against a 
pipe.

Another guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him. 
Johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it.

Call has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls 
to open the door.

It starts to rise.

CALL

Christie!  Hillard!  Come on!

The door rises fully.  Ripley stands behind it.

Call starts back, not sure what the woman will do.

Ripley surveys the scene.

The Alien, burrowing its head into the belly of the guard, stops.  
Looks up.

Everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other.  ThE alien 
hisses. rears back.

Ripley looks away, contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her 
face, but her posture passive, sacrificial.  She does not move.

Everyone watches, too afraid to breathe.

The alien LUNGES at her, leaping across the room in two bounds. It's on 
her -- and she SPINS, GPABBING IT, and HURLS IT AWAY.

It lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond, jumps at her, 
knocks her back into the room, on her, its claws digging into her skin, 
piston tongue at her face, inches away. 

She locks an arm around its slick, long head and pulls back we hear its 
tendons strain, snap.

CALL (to a guard)

Shoot it!  Shoot them both!

She grabs his gun and BURNS them both.  Two less-than-human SCREAMS 
fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart.

The beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley 
again.

Ripley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with 
inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head.

She dives at it as it comes out from under....

Call shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's 
momentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the 
Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch,

Ripley only slightly better.

A few crew members rush to look over the railing.  Christie starts down 
the spiral staircase to that level.

JOHNER

Where are you going?

The creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying 
strength. Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off... 
its jaws open, dripping shaking...

The tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT. HOLDS IT.

A scream wells up in her throat.  A totally animal killshriek that she 
SCREAMS, victorious, as she RIPS THE ALIEN'S TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE.

She stands, bellows another warrior cry. The crew has gathered near.  
They watch her, awed, wary. Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to 
Call.  Ripley looks a tad pissed.

Call tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well.

Ripley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it. walks on.

Call looks at the dripping souvenier.  The pincers at the end still 
twitching.

CHRISTIE

What the FUCK is going on here?

RANE

What was that thing?  Are there more of that thing?

JOHNER (to Call)

Make a hell of a necklace...

ANGLE: HILLARD

on the upper level, kneeling by Elgyn's body.  No tears, but terribly 
quiet.

What do we do?

CHRISTIE

Same thing we were doing.  We get the fuck.

RANE

What if there's more?  Let's stay here and let the army guys deal.  
Someone will come... I mean, where are the fucking army guys?

St Just is very calmly looking up at the rafters, guns drawn

CHRISTIE

Doctor.  You know what that thing is?

WREN

I do.

CHRISTIE

And there's others.  How many?

The doctor looks around, almost guiltily.

WREN

Thirty.

JOHNER

Thirty!  We are fucked in our pink bottoms if there's thirty of those 
things.

RIPLEY

There'll be more.

Everyone looks around at her.  She is squatting in the corner facing 
away from them.

RIPLEY

They'll breed.  In a few hours there'll be twice that number.

(she stands, approaches them)

So who do I have to fuck to get off this boat?

CHRISTIE

You bought your ticket when you killed that thing. welcome aboard.

CALL.

Are you fucking crazy? She doesn't care if we....

CHRISTIE (fiercely)

You got no authority here, Call!- Now secure it!

It's the first time Christie has raised his voice, and it has the 
desired effect.

After a silent moment, Call starts again softly.

CALL

Christie, she's not human.  Wren cloned her because she was carrying an 
alien in her.

She could turn --

JOHNER

Nobody cares about your opinion, you bitch, you fucking mole --

CALL

She'll turn on us!  Just like that!

CHRISTIE

I don't give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or 
not. If we've got a wish to live then we work together, and that 
includes bug-lady.

CALL

You can't trust her.

CHRISTIE

I don't trust anyone.  CUT TO: INT.  CHAMBER/CELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER

The group is still in the adjoining chamber, but looking here into the 
cellblock where 

Ripley had been.  DiStephano and St Just come first, guns ready, 
looking about them.

They are followed by Christie and Wren.

WREN

There's a console in the guards, station.  We can punch up a diagnostic 
of the ship and plan a route.  To your ship.

CHRISTIE

That likes me fine.

He signals for the others to follow, everyone moving cautiously.

ANGLE: HILLARD

Gently lays her coat over Elgyn's face. Johner looks down a moment.

JOHNER

Via con Dios, man.

Hillard stands. Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away, 
a distrustful look on her face.

Ripley, bringing up the rear, watches the whole group with a sort of 
fascinated detatchment.

Call looks back at her.  Ripley smiles, coldly.

ANGLE: IN THE CELLBLOCK

The group makes their way slowly, quietly.  They approach a bank of 
elevators, but Wren points down an adjoining doorway.  They are about 
to go there when the elevator door lights up, indicating arrival.

The group backs up, spreads out. Those who can find cover take it. guns 
drawn.

The elevator doors open.  It is too dark inside to see:

Suddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a 
figure appears in the light.

Everyone jolts, about to fire. before they realize it is

VRIESS

Who sits in his chair, a shotgun in each hand, eyes wide. twitchier 
than they.

JOHNER

Oh, fuck...

CALL

vriess!

VRIESS (mock casual)

Hey, whatchyou guys doing?  Hey, Annalee.

CHRISTIE

Thought you were toast for certain.

VRIESS

You've seen that fucking thing?

WREN (suspiciously)

Where were you?

VRIESS

I was down by -- what do you mean? I was in maintenance, checking out 
your oxidation systems.

JOHNER

Doc's got a bug up his ass 'cause Call's a mole and he thinks we're a 
conspiracy.

VRIESS (looking at Call)

She's a what?

JOHNER

A mole.  A fucking spy.

Vriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone.

CHRISTIE

We got'a mission here, people.  Let's keep moving.

They do.

CUT TO: INT.  GUARDS, STATION - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE: THE CONSOLE

A hologram of the ship appears above the screen.  It looks a solid as 
the ship itself, except that parts of it occasional break themselves 
down to show interiors.

The group looks it over. Parts of the ship are simply not there, the 
sections around those holes red.  Wren points them out.

WREN

We've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- 
Jesus, right by the engine room.  We're very lucky.

ST JUST (sarcastically)

Lucky we.

CHRISTIE

What about the Betty?  Our ship.

WREN

The dock seems to be intact.

CHRISTIE

Then we head for it.

JOHNER

Can we track those fucking things?

WREN

No.

JOHNER

We could get to the Betty and they could be all over it!

RANE

Are you toting a better fucking idea?

WREN

All of the activity seems'to have been in the aft-sector, by the 
barracks.

There's no reason to suppose they'd move

RIPLEY

They won't.

Everybody looks at her.

RIPLEY

They're breeding. They've got new bodies to work on. They'll stay 
close. If they send anybody out, it'll be here. Where the... meat is.

CALL

'The meat' . Jesus.

ST JUST

They're breeding.  How long does that take?

RIPLEY

Hours.

WREN

Or less.  The process has accelerated, something to do with the cloned 
cells.

CHRISTIE

Faster we get from here to there, the better.

ST JUST

With all the devils of hell in between.

JOHNER

Well, if we want to make decent time I say we ditch the cripple.

(to Vriess)

No offense.

VRIESS (giving him the finger)

None taken.

HILLARD

Nobody's left behind, Johner. Not even you.

Her voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it.  Nobody backtalks her.

CHRISTIE

So what's our route?

WREN

I'm trying to figure it. we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked 
on both sides here,

I'm not sure

DISTEPHMO

Sir?  There is the lift.

WREN

Show me.

DiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's 
indicating revealed.

DISTEPHMO

The lifts. They run straight from the top of the ship down to 
engineering. No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a 
maintenece access tunnel here

(points to the center of the shaft)

that runs above level one deck. Take us right to the dock.

CHRISTIE

Sounds reasonable.

DISTEPHANO

I don't have the code for the access tunnel door.

WREN

I can override.

DISTEPHMO

(indicating the route)

Then we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen.  To the bottom 
of the shaft.

Up, through the tunnel, and onto the ship.  Home free.

ANGLE: VRIESS

Is unloading additional ammo from inside his chair.  He toss one of his 
shotguns to Hillard.

VRIESS

They never check the chair...

He pulls out a grenade launcher.  It's so compact it's almost cute, 
cradled one handed like an uzi.

VRIESS

Call.

She looks around and he tosses it to her.  The gesture is not 
acconmpanied by any show of warmth.

VRIESS

Try not to shoot your foot off.

WREN

You people should know --

ST JUST

We.won't shoot at the windows, Doc.

WREN

No. The aliens, they bleed molecular acid.

CHRISTIE

That's right, I saw that.

VRIESS

So did I.

JOHNER

We can't shoot them?  Fuck that, I'm shooting them.

WREN

This is a big vessel, and for the most part we should be okay. But if 
we get anywhere near the outer hull and start strafing them...

He indicates the hologram, the sections of the ship missing.  Everyone 
gets it.

CHISTIE

If we're clear then let's get on it. We'll go by twos --

RIPLEY

We're moving.

CHRISTIE

What?

RIPLEY

The ship is moving. 1 can feel it.

RANE

I don't feel shit -- what, do you mean they're piloting this fucking 
thing?

VRIESS

This ship has stealthrun, even if we were moving there's no way she 
could feel it.

CALL  She's right.

Call is working the computer now.

CALL

The ship's been going since the attack.

WREN

It's uh, it's standard, I think.

DISTEPHANO

That's right. If the ship takes on any serious damage it autopilots 
back to homebase.

CALL (to Wren, pissed)

You were planning to let us know this?

WREN

I forgot.

HILLARD

What is homebase?

WREN

Earth.

CALL

Oh, God.  Oh, you bastard...

JOHNER

Earth?  I'm not going to that fucking slum.

CALL

If those things get to Earth, It'll be...

RIPLEY (not very concerned).

The end.

ST JUST

That's not our problem.

CALL

We've got to blow the ship.

CHRISTIE

We don't have to do anything till we get off it.  How long till we get 
there?

CALL

Three hours.  Almost.

CHRISTIE

Then that's what we got.  Let's move.

CALL

Don't you understand what this means?

CHRISTIE

I understand my hide.  And I like it on me. Let's go.

(to Ripley)

What are you called, Ripley?  You mind taking point?

She moves to the head of the line, and they start.

CUT TO: INT.  LABS - LATER

As they progress.  Everyone with a gun has it at the ready.  Ripley is 
a few yards in front.

She stops, sniffs.  Listens.

RIPLEY

Clear.

Johner moves up next to her.

JOHNER

You've come up against these things before?

RIPLEY

Yes.

JOHNER

So what did you do ?

RIPLEY

I died.

He lags behind a bit, thrown.

JOHNER

That wasn't really what I wanted to hear...

DiStephano points to a door.

DISTEPFANO

This way.

And Ripley leads them in.

CUT TO: INT.  LAB - CONTINUOUS

As Ripley enters, we can see that this lab has been trashed.  Ripley 
surveys the wreckage calmly, keeps moving. As the others file in, their 
horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one.

Among the debris are three bodies, chests exploded outward.

JOHNER

Fuck me ...

CHRISTIE

Let's keep moving.

The door to the next chamber is ajar. Christie and Vriess in, then St 
Just, then Ripley.

INT..NEXT CHAMBER

Something LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS 
into her side, throwing her off balance.

St Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure 
cowering in the corner.

Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with 
terror.

PURVIS

Get away from me!

CHRISTIE

Drop the rod, man.  Do it!

PURVIS.

Get away...

But the energy is out of him.  The rod falls with a hollow clatter. He 
looks weakly from face to face.

PURVIS

What's going on?

St Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls.

ST JUST

Purvis.  What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost 
ship.

PURVIS

What ship?  Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew 
for the nickel refinery...

I wake up, I don't understand... I saw something... horrible ...

CALL

Look, you come with us.  It's dangerous here.

Ripley SNIFFS.  Cocks her head.

RIPLEY

Leave him.

CALL

Fuck you.  We're not leaving anyone on this boat.

RIPLEY

He's carrying..

JOHNER

He's what?

RIPLEY

He's got one....	inside him. I can smell it.

PURVIS

Inside me? What?

JOHNER

Shit, I don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass.

VRIESS

It's a bad risk.

CALL

We can't just leave him.

VRIESS

I thought you came here to stop them from spreading.

CALL (to Wren, torn)

Isn't there a process, can't you stop it?

ST JUST

We've got no time for that.

WREN

I couldn't do it here. The lab's torn apart.

ST JUST (quietly)

I could do him. Painless, back of the head. Might be the best way.

CALL

There's gotta be another way. If we freeze him --

PURVIS

WHAT'S IN-FUCKING-SIDE ME?!?!?

They all look at him, a bit sheepishly.

WREN

A parasite.  A foreign element that ....

Ripley steps in front of the doctor.

RIPLEY

There's a monster in your stomach. They (indicating the smugglers) 
hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him (indicatingWren) and he put 
an alien in you. In a few hours it will punch  its way through your 
chest and you'll die.  Any questions?

Purvis is wide-eyed, stunned.  After a moment he stammers

PURVIS

Who are you?

RIPLEY

I'm the monster's mother.

She starts heading out of the chamber.  Call turns to the others.

CALL

He comes with us.  We can freeze him on the Betty and get the doctor to 
remove it later.

WREN

All right.

JOHNER

Since when are you in fucking charge?

CALL

Since you were born without balls.

VRIESS

Ease off, people.

CHRISTIE (to Purvis, herding him along)

Come with us.  You might even live.  Get twitchy on me and you will be 
shot.

They move out.

CUT-TO: INT.  HALL - LATER

still in the same general area, still looking around every corner.  
It's been too quiet too long, and the group senses that & They move 
into

INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM TWO - CONTINUOUS

It's in bad shape, so we might not recognize it as the chamber the 
queen was in.

WREN

She's gone.

ST JUST

Who?

WREN

The Queen.

JOHNER

Good.

He is loooking into the room.the queen was kept in.  A residue of slime 
is all that's left here.

Beyond the queen's chamber is another observation room.  Wren indicates 
that they have to go through.

Suddenly a burner blast FIRES at them, just missing them as they duck.

They hear more blasts, not aimed at them, and screams.

SOLDIER (O.S.)

Pull back!   Pull back!

OTHER SOLDIER (O.S.)

It's on me!

Ripley looks up and can just see two aliens making short work of a 
group of soldiers.

Call instantly moves to attack, and Ripley grabs her, holds tight.

CALL

We've got to help them!

RIPLEY

Can't.

CALL

You bitch, let go of me!

She does, and Call rises.

The noise is gone. What she can see of the soldiers-is parts.

She is shaking at the vision when an alien RISES in front on the 
soldiers.  Call ducks back down, terrified.

Christie hisses at her.

CHRISTIE

You want to get yourself killed, then you run solo.

ST JUST

How many?

RIPLEY

At least two.

ST JUST

Think they heard us?

RIPLEY

Yep.

HILLARD

Fine by me ...

JOHNER

Yeah, let 'em come.

CHRISTIE

Wren.  Any other way around?

Wren shakes his head.

CHRISTIE

We can't just walk in there.

WREN (thinking)

No. No, but they can.

CHRISTIE

Say again?

WREN

The cages all have failsafes.  Liquid nitrogen.  Get 'em to come to us 
and I can freeze em.

CHRISTIE

Excellent.   Get-ready.

Wren goes over to the failsafe button. The others look out at the 
aliens.

CHRISTIE

Okay... (calls out) Hey!

VRIESS

Hey, guys!

JOHNER

Here, kitty...

The aliens react, start for the cage.  Four 'of them.  They reach the 
edge of it and stop.

Look around, at each other..

But go nowhere.

DISTEPHMO

They're not coming.

JOHNER

Hey!  Fresh meat here!

RIPLEY.

They know it's a trap.

RANE

Oh, bullshit!

CHRISTIE

What do we do?

JOHNER

Shoot the fucking things!

VRIESS

There's too many, and we don't have the angle.

RIPLEY

Bait.

CALL

What?

RIPLEY

Give em a reason to go in there. Throw somebody in.

HILLARD

Fuck you!

RIPLEY

DO we want to live? Give em her.

She indicates Call, who looks around, nervous at the lack of protest 
about this idea.

Ripley points at Rane.

RIPLEY

Or the skinny one, it doesn't matter. We can't resist the smell of 
meat.

CALL

We ?

JOHNER 

Fuck, I'm with her!  Give 'em Annalee!

CHRISTIE

Now hold on

DISTEPHMO

You people are insane.

JOHNER

Now you're not exactly in the club either, soldier.

People start pointing guns at each other.

RANE

Fuck you all, I'm not dying for you.

CALL

Stop this.

Ripley grabs her.  Looks at the others.

RIPLEY

Come on!  Do you want to live or not?

(to Call) It won't hurt long.

CALL (terrified)

Noo...

RIPLEY (to Wren)

NOW!

Wren hits the button just as three aliens are bounding across the cage 
-- they're almost to the posse, people screaming, scrambling, when the 
freezing gas hits, turning the beasts to statues.

The forth one sees this and flees, but St Just stands and put four 
bullets in it from forty yards. It slumps over.

Everyone is silent, stunned.  Breathing hard.

VRIESS (realizes)

Fear.

Ripley nods.

VRIESS

That's how they knew it was a trap.  They couldn't smell the fear.

RIPLEY (looking at Call)

So I gave them some.

JOHNER (gleefully)

Son of a bitch!

He pops up and FIRES at the frozen aliens - - they EXPLODE into 
fragments.

CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA

Gildihg through space, passing Jupiter's moons with dazzling speed.

CUT TO: INT.  HALL   LATER

Ripley and Call are on point.  Ripley looks down the hall.  Call is 
staring at her, and

Ripley can feel the girls eyes on her back.

RIPLEY(without looking around)

Did you think I was going to... feed you to them?

CALL

I think you still might.

Ripley smiles.  She may be right.

RIPLEY

I want to live.

CALL

And you don't care about anything else.

RIPLEY

No.

CALL (bitterly)

I guess you're more human than I thought.

RIPLEY

Why did you come here?

CALL

To kill you, remember? (after a beat) Because somebody has to.

RIPLEY

well it's not me.  I did my time.  Now I just want to...

She stops dead, staring at a door.

CLONING STORAGE FACILITY is written on it. Stencilled beneath that is 
`numbers 1-7`.

Ripley stares. Tries the door, which opens.

DISTEPHMO

That's not the way.

CHRISTIE

Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing.

Ripley is looking down at her arm, at the 8 tattooed on it.

She looks at Call.  Looks back at wren.

WREN

Ripley... don't.

She enters.

CUT TO: INT.  CLONING STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

She stands a moment, staring, before proceeding through it.  Call 
stands in the doorway, others crowding behind her. Every face registers 
the horror of what they are seeing, but none more so than Ripley's

Numbers one through seven.  The first failed efforts to clone Ripley.

They are lined up like museum exhibits -- or side show freaks.

Here is the fetal Ripley, the fetal alien visible through its 
translucent chest.

In a jar.

Here is a prematurely old, diseased Ripley, withered blue skin cling to 
Collapsed bones.

Here is an attempt to separate the alien and grow it without the host -
- boneless, bubbling tissue, weak and useless mouth rigored in midmew.

Each one more horrifying than the last, and the last the worst of all.

Ripley approaches, and stares at number seven.

A complete mixture of alien and human DNA.

A tortured, disgusting hybrid, half Ripley, half nightmare.

Hooked up wires and machines, it lies on the tilted-table, its head 
nearly level with

Ripley's as she finally approaches it.

When it opens its eyes, they are hers.

it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her.  Recognises her.

Ripley cannot even speak.  She begins to shake slightly looking at 
number seven.

NUMBER SEVEN

Kill ... us ...

Ripley's eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling 
a mouth.

Ripley staggers back a step, shaking now.  This is too much to bear...

CALL

Ripley!

Ripley turns, slowly, still in a fever dream.

Call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud CRACK.  Her eyes meet 
Ripley's.

Call tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it 
Ripley FIRES, a grenade chugging to the end of room and BURSTING in 
fire and noise, she FIRES another, tissue and steel exploding into 
flame, she turns to number seven, hand shakes momentarily...And she 
FIRES, the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame.

Freezing gas jets fill the room, extinguishing potential spread, but 
the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber.

She backs out, the crew waiting for her outside.

The launcher falls loudly to the ground.  Ripley turns to Wren, her 
face rigid with pain.

Wren backs up a step, looking around him for protection that the others 
have no thought of providing.

CALL

Ripley... Don't do it.

Ripley stops. weariness suffusing her expression.

RIPLEY

Don't do what?

The tension pases.  Wren breathes a little sigh of relief.

Call PUNCHES him across the jaw, his head whipping around as collapses 
to the ground.

Call starts down the hall, not even looking at him.

CALL

Don't do that.

Feeling his jaw, Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this.  
It's kind of winning.

Christie helps him up.

CHRISTIE

Had it coming, Doc.

Johner looks in at the burning lab.

JOHNER

What's the big deal?  Fucking waste of ammo.

ST JUST

Let's move before anything comes to check out the noise.

JOHNER

Chicks, man....

DISTEPHANO

We go down from here.

CHRISTIE (to Vriess)

We got to lose the chair.  Vriess.

VRIESS

I know.

CHRISTIE

Kawlang maneuver, all right?

Vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair.

VRIESS

Just like old times...

CUT TO: INT.  ROOM - LATER

A hatch opens. Ripley drops down, surveys the scene.  Quiet dark, 
empty.

Ripley comes up, Call behind her.  Ripley sniffs, listens.  Closes her 
eyes. After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to 
follow.

Slowly, they make their way down the corridor. Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , 
guns drawn.

Bringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun.. He turn slowly, 
alert, and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other 
way, also with a shotgun.

CALL (to Ripley)

That lab... 1 can't imagine how that must feel.

RIPLEY

No. You can't.

Ripley looks down.  The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark 
water.

Ripley steps into it, moves up a few paces. The others gingerly follow.

Vriess is facing the back. He looks up.

VRIESS

The cooling tanks.  They must have blown during the trouble.

ANGLE: THE COOLING TANKS

We see the round underbelly of two huge tanks.  There are gaping, 
twisted holes in them.

JOHNER

The nasties couldn't have done it, could they?

HILLARD

What for...?

WREN

Down here. He is at the front with Ripley and-Call, where the water is 
waste deep.

He looks down at a stairwell, just the top of the railing visible above 
the murky water.

RIPLEY

There's no other way?

WREN

We're at the bottom of the ship.  Some of the worst damage is down 
here.

Most of the sections are sealed off.

RIPLEY

You're sure?

WREN

There's the noncom's entrance back there, but it's flooded too, and 
it's a longer run.

CALL

He's right.  We're gonna have to do it this way.

WREN

It's just through the kitchen, then up, maybe seventy feet.

RIPLEY

I don't like it.

ST JUST

What's to like?

CHRISTIE (to vriess)

You ready to get wet, partner?

VRIESS

Oh yeah.

HILLARD

You sure about the distance?

WREN

Yes.

CALL

No locked doors?

WREN

It's an open hall.  Just keep left when you hit the bottom of the 
staircase.

JOHNER

This sucks.

ANGLE: DI STEPHANO

He flips caps over the barrel of the gun, slides a panel over the 
digital readout.

The burner is ready to go, watertight.

DISTEPHMO (to St Just)

You should secure'your weapons.

St Just holds up his two guns.

ST JUST

These are disposables.  They can take it.

DISTEPHANO

Disposables. I heard about those. How many rounds?

ST JUST

Twenty. Split points, give you a good hole even at the smaller caliber.

DISTEPHANO

Cool.

ST JUST

They're big with hitters. 'Cause you throw em away after the job. 
Nobody likes throwing  away a weapon they're attached to.  You know?

He smiles at Di Stephano, who looks a little uneasy about the turn the 
conversation has taken.

He joins the others who are getting ready to dive..

CALL

Do I have to tell everyone to take a deep breath?

A couple of the guys smile.

VRIESS

Christie, do me a favor.  When we hit the surface on the other side... 
no backstroke.  Okay?

CHRISTIE (laughing)

You'll be forever blowing bubbles. On three...

He counts down, the two suck in enormous breaths -- and dive right 
behind Call and Ripley.

One by one the entire crew slips down into the black water.

CUT TO:  INT.  STAIRWELL\KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

It's all underwater.  Visiblity is poor.  The crew move swiftly and 
gracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen.

In here it's a tad labyrinthian, and the size of the room it darker. 
Wren heads straight for the other end.

They swim.  Safety is a good fifty feet away.

They are tense, concentrated.  Swimming past dark spaces.  Anything 
could be hiding here.

Johner looks about him, very nervous.  Dark spaces.  He looks behind.

Three aliens are right behind him.

Panic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and FIRES 
at them, tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible 
ease.

Ripley, all the way to the stairs, sees.  She hurries the others past 
her.

They swim frantically for safety, Hillard Wren, Christie and Vriess.

Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, 
pull him into it.

Hillard FIRES in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still 
firing at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot.

Call is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating 
the surface.

She is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB.

A net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the 
surface.

Call struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as 
Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear 
through it, but they are getting weaker.

Ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close 
behind.

She looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface 
-- but an  alien GRABS her foot, holding her down. Now SHE is running 
out of air KICKS at it, it  lets go.

The others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but 
it's tough, she  still can't get her head up --

--Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning.  Takes in a huge mouthful 
of water and begins thrashing.

Ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart 
with a mighty heave, she glides up through --

CLOSE UP: RIPLEY'S FACE

Just BREAKS the surface, she takes in a huge GASP of air, FACEHUGGER 
CLAMPS DOWN ON HER.

Ripley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the 
surface.

Wren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him ,but Call nails it in 
four shots.

Christie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING, back to back, 
in a circular sweep.

They decimate a number of eggs

ANGLE: UNDERWATER

Ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its 
fingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint.  
Worse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing 
horribly.

In utmost disgust, Ripley PULLS it APART. and the three aliens are 
COMING RIGHT AT HER.

ABOVE - THE SURFACE

Most of the crew has gotten up out of the water.  Christie holding a 
facehugger inches from his face, others screaming, taking a bead on it.

CHRISTIE

Get it!  Kill it!

CALL

The blood'll burn you!  Throw it!

He does, and Johner nails it in midflight.

Hillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water, but he is not 
breathing.

ANGLE: UNDER THE SURFACE

Ripley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and 
shoots it.

They swim up and away from the spreading, lethal bloodpool.

ANGLE: ABOVE THE SURFACE

They come up out of the water, and an alien rises right behind them.  
Everyone who can, shoots it.  It falls back into the water.

CHRISTIE

A trap!  They set a goddamn ambush!

JOHNER

Give me that!

He pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him 
mouth to mouth.

Johner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water, the whole thing 
SMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge. we hear an alien wail 
bubble from below the surface.

JOHNER (grinning feverishly)

Okay!  Everybody out of the pool!

VRIESS

Let's get the fuck!

Di Stephano sputters back to life.  Ripley picks him up with one hand,

HILLARD (to Wren)

Which way?

WREN

Up here.

He takes off, the others following.

WREN

Up through the lift shaft!

He stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel.  Ripley 
come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt.

ST JUST

Company!

He's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens.

She herds them into the shaft.

CUT TO: INT.  LIFTSHAFT - CONTINUOUS

It goes down about four stories, and up seemingly forever.. Enough room 
for or three

elevators, one of which is two stories below.

WREN

UP!

He starts climbing.  It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each 
shaft section.

Call comes up behind him.  Ripley and others pair off on other ladders.

They climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin 
POUNDING on the metal door, it buckles under their might.

JOHNER

Move!

WREN

Not far!

Still POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls 
it out.

ANGLE: LIFT

Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge.  He climbs on.  Set back a few feet 
from the shaft is a small maintenance access door. works the keypad 
beside it as Call climbs up behind him.

The aliens SMASH through the door, one of them SAILING across the shaft 
to grab a pipe on the other side. Instantly four of them are swarming 
up the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans 
on ladders.

On one of the aliens a facehugger crawls, constantly moving about on 
the adult alien's head like a frightened spider.

CALL

Hurry!

WREN

It's jammed!  Shit!  Gun!

She hands him her gun and without hesitation he SHOOTS HER THROUGH THE 
CHEST.

She flies back and DOWN THE SHAFT, lands HARD on an elevator six 
stories below.

Eyes wide and empty.

VRIESS

NOO!

He fires up at Wren, but Wren has punched in the code and slipped 
through the opening door..

Ripley LEAPS through the air and grabs the ledge, hauling herself up 
just in time to see  the door shut.  The lock lights turn red.

She SLAMS against the door, but to no avail.

The aliens are getting closer.  St Just, the closest to the bottom, 
suddenly lets go of  the ladder.  His knees hooked over a rung, he 
drops, hangs up side down, his guns  filling his hands.

He blows several holes in the nearest alien.

Ripley is furious, maybe surprised just how so.  Suddenly an alien 
RISES OVER THE LEDGE, it's not three feet away from her and she 
SCREAMS, HURLS herself at it and they both go

FLYING OFF into-space, they hit the wall on the other side, they fall. 

RIPLEY GRABS a pole, it practically tears her arm out of her socket but 
she holds on, the alien isn't so lucky, it plummets unable to find 
puchase. We see it fall past  the unmoving body of Call.

ANGTE: CALLS FACE

As the facehugger CLAMPS onto it. Pauses. Pushes off a bit, two digits 
probing Call's nostrils.  Sensing no breath, the thing scurries away to 
find a better host.

Another alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess. Vriess 
frantically tries to reload.

VRIESS

It's on us!

Christie turns, aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie FIRES, but 
the alien is too close, it grabs Christie, spurting blood all over him.  
He SCREAMS, lets go of the ladder

Vriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again, the alien 
flying off  and down the shaft.

HILLARD

We gotta go!

The last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers.

RIPLEY

We're locked in.

JOHNER 

Fuck!

PURVIS

How far to the next door?

DISTEPHANO

All the way.

RIPLEY

Then we climb.

They start, moving as fast as they can.

VRIESSS (to Christie)

You just hang on, man.  I'll get us there.

He starts climbing up, impressively fast considering the burden hanging 
from his back.

JOHNER (to Ripley)

Are they going for reinforcements?

RIPLEY

Fucked if I know.

They climb.

And climb, the minutes stretching out, still no door.  Ripley easily 
ahead of the rest.

Finally:

RIPLEY

I think I see the door.

PURVIS (exhausted)

Great.

Vriess is having increasing trouble.  Hillard notices him lagging 
behind, and why.

HILLARD

Vriess!  Jesus!

Vriess is moving very quickly, considering. But the effort is becoming 
too much.

VRIESS

We're coming...

Johner scrambles down next to Vriess.

he checks the pulse in Christie's neck.

Vriess, man... he's dead.

Refusing to hear it, Vriess struggles to climb further.

VRIESS

We'll get him to medlab... just a little while ...

Johner looks over at Hillard.  Without saying a word, she pull out a 
good-sized hunting  knife, flicks it open.

She slices through the cord holding them together, and Christie's body 
falls free.

Vriess shuts his eyes, feeling it.  ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT

There is silence as Christie's body drops down the black abyss

Until, from up the shaft next to where he fell, we see two ALIENS 
COMING UP.

PURVIS

Fuck!  Company!

Hillard looks up the shaft.

HILLARD

How much further?,

JOHNER

Too fucking far.  Let's G0 !

They start to climb, but the aliens are making much better time.

A loud CLACKING sounds from the bottom of the shaft.  A few of them 
look down.

ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT

The aliens are still coming, but suddenly the lift passes them heading 
up at high speed.

JOHNER

They can work the elevators?  Is there anything fucking else we should 
know about them?!

He's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of 
them.

The lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is 
flipped.

They wait, guns ready. Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead.

CALL

Get on!

A moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift.

Call drops back down inside.

An alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump.  St Just 
shoots the shit out of it.

HILLARD

Where are the others?

CUT TO: INT.  LIFT - CONTINUOUS

Call flips the brake off, and the lift shoots up.  She is holding her 
jacket closed around  her chest wound, but it doesn't seem to bother 
her particularly much.

ANGLE: ON TOP

Everybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft.

ANGLE: INSIDE

Call waits for the signal to stop and an alien PUNCHES THROUGH the 
bottom of the lift.  Call yells as it gets its head and an arm through, 
clawing for her.

ANGLE:	ON THE BOTTOM

We see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift.

ANGLE:	ON TOP

Ripley sees the door approaching

RIPLEY

stop!

ANGLE: INSIDE

Call hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of 
the door -

- giving both Ripley and Call access.  Bu the alien is still grabbing 
for her --

Ripley pries open the doors again, the crew pouring out into the hall. 
Ripley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors

The alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs 
Call's ankle, but

Ripley wrenches her free.

They roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside 
the lift.

Ripley grabs Hillardl's shotgun.  Levels it at the cables holding the 
lift.  FIRES.

The lift PLUMMIETS, the alien still halfway in.

It shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way 
down, neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as--

The lift SMASHES into the bottom of the shaft, crushing both the Aliens 
to jelly.

ANGLE:	UPPER DOOR

Johner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft.

JOHNER

Eat that, fuckneck!!

They all breathe hard, exhausted, before they can muster for the next 
stretch. 

Call stands with her back to them.

VRIESS

Baby, am I glad to see you.  I thought dickbag took you out for sure.  
Are you, hurt?

CALL

I'm fine.

DISTEPHANO

You got body armour on?

CALL

Yeah.  Come on.

Ripley isn't buying.

RIPLEY

You were Gunshot.  I saw.

CALL

I'm fine!

Ripley spins her around.  Call stares at Ripley, sullenly a small 
trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril. Ripley looks down.

ANGLE: CALL'S CHEST

Wren has indeed made a messy hole here, but where blood and bone should 
be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring.  To state the obvious:

A robot.

JOHNER

Call's a goddam sythetic!

HILLARD

Son of a bitch.  Little Annalee's just full of surprises.

RIPLEY (quietly)

I should have known.

ST JUST

Couldn't smell this one out?

RIPLEY

No, I mean... all that crap about being human - there's no one so 
zealous as a Born Again.

VRIESS (to Call)

You're an LM7, aren't you?  Is that it?

CALL

Leave me alone.

Her voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by 
the wounds.

The voice is a shade slow, and echoes strangely.

VRIESS

Call ....

CALL (bitterly)

Yes.

ST JUST

LM7?  Shit.  That explains a lot.

YRIESS (to Ripley)

The latest and best.  They were supposed to revitalize the synthetic 
industy.

Instead they buried it.

Ripley looks at the girl.

RIPLEY

They were-too good.

VRIESS

Oh yeah.  Overrode their own behavioral inhibitors.  Didn't feel like 
being told what to do.

The government ordered a recall.  Fucking massacre.

HILLARD

1 always heard there were a few that got out alive, but man... I never 
thought I'd see one.

Johner starts laughing.

JOHNER

Oh, Christ.  Doing fucking nickel and dime border runs, selling second 
hand junk to the farm belt... and we're carrying the most expensive 
piece of contraband in the system.

That's rich.

PURVIS (getting anxious)

It's great, she's a toaster oven... Can we leave now?

Vriess tries to touch Call's wound.

VRIESS

Let me see.

Call pulls away.

JOHNER

Yeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess.

Maybe she just needs an oil change.

RIPLEY

Let's go.

They start off again, Johner and St Just bringing up the rear

JOHNER

Can't believe I almost fucked the thing.

ST JUST

Yeah, like you've never fucked a robot.

ANGLE: RIPLEY

Letting DiStephano lead.

RIPLEY

DiStephano.  Where are we?

DISTEPHANO

Upper decks... Storage... the chapell's up here, not much else.

RIPLEY

Can we get to the ship?

DISTEPHANO

Well, we're a ways out,of the way, but I think we can get through to 
the garden.

From there, it's down a few levels, it's do-able.

What if the fucking doctor gets there first?

VRIESS

It's a good point.

DISTEPHANO

Shit.

They have reached an access door.  Debris blocks the way.

RIPLEY

Another way?

DISTEPHANO

Uh, yeah.  Through the wall.  We'll have to get one of these panels 
off.  It'll take a while.

(to Vriess) You got tools?

VRIESS

Yeah, but no torch.

JOHNER

Fucking blow the door!

HILLARD

Assface, We're on the top of this thing.

(pointing to the ceiling)

That's hull.

VRIESS

What about Wren? if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us 
around.

RIPLEY

We have to get in too.

DISTEPHANO

There's no access console on this level. We'd have to-backtrack.

HILLARD

Fuck that.

DISTEPHANO

And I don't have the security access that Wren does anyway.

Ripley turns to Call.

RIPLEY

Call.

CALL

No. I can't.

JOHNER.

Bullshit.  She's a damn well talking machine.

CALL

There's another way.

DISTEPHMO

Just tell her to access it on remote.

VRIESS

Shit, that's right.  Any of the new model droids can access the 
mainframe.

JOHNER

Just by blinking.

CALL

I can't.

ST JUST

No time to get coy, Annalee.

CALL

I can't. I burned my modem drive.  We all did.

VRIESS

You can still patch in manually. You know that.

Call looks over at the group, staring at her.  She knows she doesn't 
have a choice.

DISTEPHANO

There's ports in the chapel.

RIPLEY

Come on.

(to the others)

You get started on that wall.

CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOU@

Ripley and Call enter the small room.  Ripley sits in one of the pews, 
pulls out a bible.

it somewhat resembles a Newton Under the leather flap is a screen 
reading.:

HOLY BIBLE.  PRE START.

Ripley pulls out the cord from the bible's port, holds it up

CALL

Don't make me do this.

RIPLEY

Don't make me make you.

CALL

I don't want to go in there.

RIPLEY

Get over it.

CALL

It's like... your insides are liquid. It's not real.

RIPLEY

You can blow the ship.  Before it reaches Earth.  Kill them all.  Just 
give us time to get

out first.

That convinces Call.  She pulls up her sleeve, and begins. pushes a 
part of her forearm,

just below the crook of her elbow.  It has a spring release catch, and 
a small panel rises

up with two computer ports on it.  She takes the cable from Ripley and 
plugs it in.

It looks almost like she's mainlining heroin.

She cocks her head.

CALL

Dammit.

RIPLEY

Anything?

CALL

Hold on.

She reaches in her chest, reconnects some tubes.  She twitches then 
shuts her eyes.

It's beginning.

She begins speaking very rapidly, eyes still shut.

CALL

Breach in sector seven sector three sector nine unstable -- engines 
operating at eighty

six percent -forty six minutes until earthdock.

Her voice has a slight mechanical quality as she rattles this off.  Her 
eyes open.

CALL

We burned too much energy -- I can't make critical mass.  I can't blow 
it.

RIPLEY

Then crash it.

TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS

As the crew works at getting the wall panel off,.

TO: INT.  CHAPPEL   A BIT LATER

CALL

Ground level recalibrated... new destination 760, 403.  Done.  Forty 
one minutes until impact.

RIPLEY

Try to clear us a path to the ship.

CALL

Tracking movement in sublevels six through nine.  Video is down.  
Attempted rerouting

nonfunctional, wait, partial visual in waste tank 5, unauthorized 
presence...

VRIESS

Unauthorized?

CALL

Nonhuman.

RIPLEY

How many?

Please wait.. emergency override on. console 45V, level one... 
handprint ID...

(like herself)

It's Wren. 	He's almost at the Betty.

RIPLEY

And how do	you feel about that?

CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS

Wren is holding his hand to the scanner, just as Call described.  The 
red light turns

green and we hear the locks the door crack open.

FATHER

Emergency override validated.

The door begins to rise.  Looking around him, Wren waits to through.

The door grinds to a halt, still too low to climb under.  The lights go 
out, only the faintest glow coming from various instrument panels. 
wren's expression drains.

WREN

Father, reboot systems on 45V, authorization 'starling'.

Nothing happens.  Wren looks about him, beginning to sweat.

Did the aliens do this?

WREN

Father, locate power drain, report.

Father?

CALL - (on the system)

Father's dead, asshole.

Wren spins in shock at the sound of Call's voice. it,s everywhere 
around him.

She has downloaded her vocal matrix place of Father's. 

(She's not just speaking over a PA, she is the PA.)

The door SLAMS back-down, locks clack into place.  The doors behind him 
open up, 

emergency lighting pulsing along toward him.

CALL\SHIP

Intruder on level one... all aliens please proceed to level one.

Wren is freaking.  He turns back down the corridor, looking about him 
wildly.

CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

Call pulls the cord out of her port.

RIPLEY

You got a mean strak.

CALL

It's done.  That should hold the fuck.

This as her voice track slips even more.  She works the wires in her 
cheest, trying

to fix it.

RIPLEY

Let me see

CALL

Don't touch me.

Ripley backs off.

CALL

You must think this is pretty funny.

RIPLEY

Yes.  But I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.  And I'm not sure 
they are.

CALL

Why do you go on living?  How can you stand it?  How can you stand... 
yourself?

Ripley shrugs.

RIPLEY

Not so hard.  Not much choice.

CALL

At least there's part of you that's human.  I'm just... fuck.  Look at 
me....

She looks at the hole in her chest, the white and sticky fibers.

CALL

I'm disgusting.

Her voice is at its slowest here, low and eerie.  It's a mechanical 
problem, but 

it sounds just like despair.

RIPLEY

Do you dream?

CALL

I ... we have neural processors that run through....  (stops)  Yes.

RIPLEY

When I sleep, I dream about it.  Them.  Every night.  All around me ... 
in me. 

I used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore.

CALL

Why?

RIPLEY

Because no matter how bad the dreams get ... when I wake up it's always 
worse.

Purvis enters.

PURVIS

I guess we're almost there.

RIPLEY

Right.

He exits again.  Call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring.  We 
hear her voice slip back to normal as she says:

CALL

Let's get going.

CUT TO: INT. TUNNEL

As they come one by one through the wall.

DISTEPHANO

Not far now.

PURVIS

God, I'm so tired...

JOHNER

Yeah, well, we'll sleep when we're dead.

Ripley follows him through.

RIPLEY

Don't count on it.

The rest of them come through and walk into:

INT.  THE GARDEN    CONTINUOUS

The Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across, and then down on a 
terraced slope.

Everywhere are different kinds of plants: trees, vegetable plants, 
exotic and experimental hybrids.

Access paths crisscross the beds.

It's huge, the single biggest space on the ship.  Yet the low ceiling, 
laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle, and prodigeous 
undergrowth make it labyrinthian, almost claustrophobic.

From where the crew is, they can barely see where it slopes down.

JOHNER

What's this fucking deal?

DISTEPHMO

This supplies most of the food for the unit.

VRIESS (holding a lucious ripe pear)

You guys got something against spam?

DISTEPHMO

And there's some lab work here too. Hybridization.

RIPLEY

At the other end?

DISTEPHMO

Runs down to the by the waste tanks.  We can get to the dock from 
there.  You, okay?

Ripley is holding her head.  She shuts her eyes.

CALL

What is it?

Ripley shakes it off.

RIPLEY

Nothing.  I'm okay.

She looks out at the jungle, they have to cross.

CALL

We should get moving.

ST JUST

Hey!  Check it out!

He has come upon a small loading truck, a sort of platform jeep.  
Vriess checks it out, takes a huge bite of his pear.

VRIESS

Beats walking.

He hauls himself up-into it. Everybody piles onto the back flatbed just 
a foot or so off the ground and just big enough to hold everyone but 
Vriess, Call and Ripley, who pushes into the driver's seat.

VRIESS

Quickly and quietly, people.

Ripley stares unconprehendingly at the controls for a momen till Call 
flips on the ignition.

RIPLEY

Thank,you.

The jeep pulls out.  It's electric, so it emits just a low hum as she 
takes it at a good clip toward the other side.

The access paths are just a bit wider than the jeep itself, plants 
rising tall all around them.

Ripley concentrates on driving.

The pass through as section of wheat , then of corn.  As they come to 
another section,

The crew's expressions change to one of pleased disbelief.

You gotta be fucking me. St Just!  Is this real?

ST JUST

So this is what heaven looks like.

We see they have driven into a healthy section of CANNABIS plants 
growing ten feet high.

The car screeches to a halt.  Ripley's at a crossroads of sorts.

RIPLEY

Which way?

HILLARD (looking at the plants)

I always wondered where the military got its funding...

An alien SHOOTS out of the brush and lands on Hillard everyone SCREAMS 
-- Ripley SLAMS her foot on the pedal

The jeep PEELS OUT, as more emerge from the brush.

HILLARD

Get it off MeeeaaaaAAGGHRE!!!!

It bores into her head before St Just can blow it away. It's head 
exploding in fragments of bone and sizzling blood as it falls away from 
the jeep, Hillard's body still clutched in arms.

Another leaps out at them, but the jeep is going a good clip and it 
misses.

The crew peppering it with bullets.

They look,about them, guns ready.

ANGLE: IN THE BRUSH

Something runs parallel to them in the plants.

ANGLE: ABOVE

Two more run on top of the grow-lamps, pacing them as well.

One DROPS DOWN -- Ripley SWERVES out of the way, driving in the plants.

They are varied, exotic -- and there are aliens behind half of them.

The crew BLASTS away all around them Ripley drives a drunkard's path 
through the brush, avoiding trees that dot the scape.

An alien DROPS onto the hood, another grabs the side -- Vries takes out 
the first, blowing it off, but the second grabs Johner, he goes flying 
over the side,.dropping his gun.

St Just is too preoccupied with his own problems on the othe to see 
that Johner is being

dragged, the alien still clutching onto him.

Shots bang out, ripping into the alien, which lets go. Johner looks up 
to see Purvis  holding Johner's gun.

Johner drags himself back on.

One jumps down onto St Just, tears a good chunk out of his midsection 
before he dusts it.

Another alien jumps on the hood just as the jeep SAILS over first ledge 
of the terraced  slope, comes-down hard enough knock it off, SAILS over 
the next -- the crew can barely hang on as the jeep crashes down slope 
after slope. 

Ripley swerves back onto the road, the jeep sliding over onto the steps 
beside it, rocking violently as they shoot down the remainder of slope, 
the aliens close on their heels.

Still blasting away at the beasts, the crew is able to put little 
distance between them as they come to the end of the garden.  Here it 
divides into three sections, all open halls with access for the jeep.

RIPLEY

Which way?

DISTEPRMO (looking over)

Left!  Left!

She swerves left, the jeep-bouncing into the hall

INT.  HALL CONTINUOUS

Where windows running along either side look out onto black space.

Ripley drives as far as she can, till a staircase -- going -- fills her 
vision, too steep

for the jeep.  She SLAMS on brakes. the jeep spinning out and coming to 
a halt.

The crew piles out, Di Stephano grabbing Vriess.  At the other end of 
the hall, the aliens

can be seen approaching.

The crew BLASTS at them, the aliens, blood splattering the narrow hall.

ANGLE: THE BLOOD

Eating into the walls. the floor.

CALL/Ship

Warning. potential hullbreach.  Clear sector.

DISTEPHANO (indicating the steps)

Down here!

They start down -- all but St Just.  He gets out of the jeep with 
difficulty.

Looks down at his wound.

Johner looks around to see him still standing atop the steps

JOHNER

St Just!  Come on, man.

St Just looks down at the wound. Back at Johner.  He walks calmly away, 
towards the aliens.

CALL

St Just!

ST JUST

You go.

He looks at the appraching aliens.

ST JUST

I'm bored.

 CALL\SHIP

Warning.  Evacuate sector.

A moment, then the crew takes off.

St Just takes a handful of pills, pops them into his mouth.  Only the 
slightest  grin suffuses his face ,as he waits for the aliens.

They close on him, and he raises his guns.

CALL\SHIP

warning...

CUT TO:

INT HALL NEARBY - CONTINUOUS

The crew runs full out.

DISTEPHANO

We have to get out of the sector!

RIPLEY

Where!

DISTEPHANO

There!

He points at a door that's down two flights and across the hall.

CUT TO: INT. HALL CONTINUOUS

The aliens close, and St Just FIRES, blasting away with bot guns.  
Aliens writhe on the

floor before him, still they cover the bodies of their brothers, still 
he fires, 

Call\ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos

-- St Just fires until both guns are empty.  In one smooth motion he 
drops them both 

and jerks his wrists and TWO-MORE disposable guns fly into his palms 
and he blasts away

ANGLE: THE BLOOD

Eating through the hull.

ANGLE: THE CREW

desperately racing for the door.

ANGLE: ST JUST

Firing with quiet glee.

ANGLE: THE CREW

The first of them are through the door.

ANGLE: St JUST

The aliens are getting closer, but still he mows them down Both his 
guns click, spent.

ST JUST

Damn.

CALL\SHIP

Warning --

and BOOM!!!!, the hall BURSTS OPEN, everything explodes into space, the 
wind rushes out as

BOOM!!!, the whole garden sector rips open, sucked out, as

is the last to get out, but the pressure change SUCKS HER she flies 
backwards, the section door coming down just in time as she SLAMS into 
it, the door closing fully as she falls, lack of pressure sucks at the 
door itself, it creaks and be inward slightly, but it holds.

The others have exited into the next hall.  They've been tossed about, 
but not as badly.

Call stops, runs back to Ripley, helps her up.  Ripley is dazed; the 
door hit the back of her head solidly.

CALL

Can you walk?  RIPLEY

I think I...

CALL

I'm not fucking carrying you

Ripley doesn't even hear her; something else drowns Call out. Ripley 
puts her hands over her ears.

RIPLEY

Mistake ... mistake...

CALL

Ripley.

RIPLEY

I can hear them, in the hive... it's close...	We're on the hive.

CALL

Jesus.  Come on.

RIPLEY

I can hear them... the queen...

CALL

What... ?

RIPLEY

She's in pain.

They CRASH UP through the floor panels, six of them, surrounding the 
two women.

Call can barely spin before Ripley GRABS her and HURLS her fifteen feet 
down the corridor, out of harm's way.

The aliens close on Ripley. She struggles but she's still weak.  One 
slams her onto the ground call recovers, looks back at Ripley

As the aliens drag her unconscious body back down under the floor.

CALL

RIPLEY!

CUT TO: INT.  AIR VENT - CONINUOUS

Dark, cramped, and already covered with a hardening layer of resin.

Skittering, insectile motion at one end heralds the aliens, as two of 
them crawl rapidly along.   The third craw upside down, the 
semiconscious Ripley draped over its chest  If she were awake, and 
out.vf her mind, she could be kissin the beast.

Her eyes flutter open, but she is obviously still groggy.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S POV

Alien head, dark tunnel passing beneath.

Scuttling through a small maze, the aliens come out into:

INT.  WASTE TANK 5 - CONTINUOUS

A vast, dark chamber, entirely encrusted with alien goo. air vent opens 
about three quarters of the way up the chamber. The aliens pour out and 
imediately scuttle UP, carrying Ripley to the top of the chamber.

They circle her and begin secreting resin, spinning a web around her.

The resin comes out of ther backs in spits and globs.

It isn't pleasant, and Ripley struggles feebly as they begin to cocoon 
her.

CUT TO: INT.  ANTECHAMBER   CONTINUOUS

The crew piles through it on their way to the loading dock.

Call brings up the rear, still looking back regretfully.

She hesitates, and Purvis takes hold of her arm.

PURVIS

We got to be moving, miss.  Best gift you can give her right now is a 
quick death.

CALL

It's not right...

PURVIS

I've been saying that all day, we need your help.

A moment more, and she heads out with him.

CUT TO: WASTE, TANK 5 - CONTINUOTJS

The aliens have finished webbing Ripley, and climb away. 

When it is done she finds herself basically hung from the ceiling, her 
legs encased and glued with glistening strands to the roof. She hangs 
therefore at an angle, looking down on the chamber. 

And so it is with her, as she swims to full consciousness, we get our 
first real look at where we are.

There are no less than ten people strung up exactly as Ripley is, 
encircling the chamber, and all looking some forty feet down at:

The Queen.  Lying on her back at the bottom of the-chamber, belly 
swollen and distended.

She is herself partially cocooned, strapped down to the at the edge of 
a black pool of blood and ichor.  Her head moves slowly back and forth, 
in delierium of pain.

There are a four or five aliens tending her, spinning goo around her, 
vomiting blood onto her belly. They might be serving her, or 
imprisoning her.  Both, in fact.

There is one thing missing from this tableau.

RIPLEY (softly)

No eggs ...

GEDIMAN (OS)

Multiple reproductive systems.

Ripley turn's slowly, to see the person next to her.  It's Gediman, 
looking wane and haggard.

He may be speaking to her but he stares straight ahead, his eyes 
glowing with near insanity.

GEDIMAN

Complete asexual reproductive cycle, self-impregnating, we found six 
different sets of ovaries in her.  Egg laying is the first cycle, 
immature.  Redundancies, redundancies

... she'll bring forth legion.

RIPLEY

They didn't impregnate you?

Now he looks at her, regret and glee at what has happened battling for 
his expression.

GEDIMAN

No... they've just been draining me.

She looks down, to see

ANGLE : GEDIMAN'S FEET

As blood from various wounds seeps slowly past his toes, dripping into 
the pool.

A keening SHRIEK comes out of the queen, as her limbs begin thrashing.

The aliens around her back off slightly. 

The bulge in her belly starts moving.

Ripley starts struggling with her bonds, terror and determination in 
her.eyes.

RIPLEY

I'm getting	out of here. Goddamnit, I'm getting the	fuck out of here!

He looks at her, the last glimmerof his sanity sinking beyond the 
horizon.

GEDIMAN

Don't you want to see what happens next?

CUT TO: INT: LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

The crew rushes in, heads for the Betty.

JOHNER

How long till we can get airborn?

VRIESS

I'll need Call to patch in to the ship again, open the hatch.

CALL

Right.

JOHNER

We hit atmo in a few minutes, only gonna make it harder.

They all run on board

INT.  THE BETTY

and head for the cockpit.  DiStephano deposits Vriess in a wheelchair.

CALL

Johner, take Purvis to the freezer.

JOHNER

All right.. Nap time, buddy.

A GUNSHOT and Purvis goes flying, blood spurting out of his shoulder, 
Johner draws but

Wren emerges from the shadows too fast.

Wren grabs Call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right 
below her shoulderblades.

WREN

Fuck with me and I put a bullet where her brain is!

Johner stands, uncertain.

WREN

DiStephano!  Take their weapons.

DISTEPHANO

Begging your pardon, sir, but eat my fuck.

DiStephano aims at Wren.  Wren backs up a step.

WREN

Drop it!  Drop it or we all die together!

Heaped in the, corner, Purvis suddenly jerks forward.  His eyes go 
wide.

CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5   CONTINUOUS

Ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds.  It's just beginning 
to work.

But the noise in here is getting worse, the aliens franitcally agitated 
as the Queens belly begins moving more violently.  SHRIEKS, and RIPLEY 
does as well, from effort or sympathy, it is hard to tell, as

THE QUEENS BELLY POPS OPEN.  Blood shoots everywhere, burning into the 
walls.

And all the screaming stops.  The movement stops.  Even Ripley stops.  
Silence.

Something emerges from the wound.

An alien, to be sure, but nothing we've seen so far, its forelegs arch 
out of its back like spiders legs, its back legs set on enormous 
haunches, thick and powerful.

Its head is long, eyeless, like the others, but along its white expanse 
red veins, coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to 
the back.

It has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its 
tongue does.

Its much bigger the the others, nearly the size of the queen herself.

And it's bone white.

GEDIMAN

Beautiful.... beautiful butterfly...

He is crying with revelatory joy.  Ripley is not.  Grimacing the sight 
and smell of the new beast, she begins pulling again at her bonds.

One of the soldiers, at the 'other end of the room from Ripley wakes 
up.

Dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal, not a 
burner.

SOLDIER

No, God...

He SCREAMS in uncomprehending horror.  The newborn stops, tilting its 
head:

It LEAPS up to the ceiling in a second, quick and effortless as a 
monstrous flea.

Leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier, gripping his sides with 
its four forelegs as he screams lustily.

pincers SWING out and pin either side of his head.. His eyes go wide 
as:

Its tongue SHOOTS into his throat.  Stays there, and we watch it drain 
the blood from his body.  We can see it, see its stomach swell, red 
tinged, as his body goes

blue and slack. His rifle drops into the black pool.

Gediman stares, transfixed, and it LANDS ON HIM.

CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS

Johner's gun drops to the floor.

Everyone backs off.

WREN

The fucking robot is going to plug back into the Auriga and land it 
according to standard operational procedure.

CALL

No she's not.

DISTEPHMO

You're fucking nuts.  You still want to bring those things back to 
earth?

JOHNER

Have you been paying any attention today?

WREN

I can handle the animals!

CALL

Fucking shoot me.

WREN

Shut up!!!

And Purvis LAUNCHES from the corner, screaming, jumps on wren - Wren 
gets off a couple of shots -- nails DiStephano in the face.  The 
soldier drops like a sack.

The other shots hit the ship, Call dives for cover as Purvis SLAMS his 
fist across Wren's face, Wren fires again and Jo is on the ground, 
rolling, grabbing his gun --

Purvis is a man possessed.  He grabs Wren's gunhand and SMAS it against 
an instrument panel, bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun.

Purvis jerks.  Blood blooms in his chest.

Everybody stops, mesmerized. wren drops to his knees, going for the 
gun, and Purvis grabs him from behind, pulls him so that the back of 
Wren's head is against his chest.

Purvis jerks again.  It takes Wren a moment to understand what's 
happening.

They both scream.

Then alien BURSTS out of Purvis's chest, STRAIGHT INTO WRENS SKULL.

Everyone else is still frozen.  Then the little critter bursts out of 
Wrens face, flying straight at Vriess.  CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5 - 
CONTINUOUS

Ripley TEARS one of her arms free as the newborn feeds beside her.

Gediman is already a shell.

Having drained the scientist, it leaps blindingly fast onto the 
ceiling.  Looks around.

Targets Ripley.

It has no eyes, but she can feel them on her anyway.  She rips at her 
bonds with a terrible effort -- the newborn LEAPS at her and she PULLS 
FREE with a scream, PLUNGING  the thirty feet to the pool as the alien 
flies over her, missing, landing on the far wall instead.

Ripley disappears beneath the surface of the water.

The newborn turns its head, trying to locate its lost prey. other 
aliens scutter closer to the pool.

Ripley stands up out of the pool, covered in blood, HOISTING THE 
SOLDIERIS GUN.

Killshriek rising from her throat as she FIRES, taking out a host of 
aliens in a single sweep, just tagging the newborn as it leaps out of 
the way.  Aliens jump at her, trying to kill and trying to protect the 
newborns, but she blows them out of the air.

It feels pretty good.

A few shots go wild, and punch big holes in the side of the tank.

Light streams in through them.  Ripley sees -- and continues firing in 
that direction.

She makes a big enough hole that she can run and SMASH through to

way, but there is a vent above her.

The newborn's head lunges at her, the small hole making it impossible 
for the creature to get all the way through.  But it wriggles, 
pushing...

Ripley jumps up, grabbing a pipe, and KICKS open the vent grate, 
throwing herself up the vertical shaft with astonishing ease.

CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS---

Vriess is scrambling away, knocking over things to avoid the baby 
alien. 

Johner SHOOTS at the creature as it speeds-towards Vriess.

CALL

Don't shoot it!  Betty's hull is too thin!

JOHNER

Look out!

it knocks over cannisters as it speeds across the table and behind some 
instruments.  VRIESS

Where'd it go?

CALL

Don't shoot it!

JOHNER

Fuck that!

It LEAPS out of the darkness and heads straight for Call, she stumbles 
back, trips -- it comes at her, leaps right at her face, she pulls her 
hand back -- and-flicks her wrist The stilletto pops out as the creatu 
flies at it, the blade slides right into its mouth, ramming eight 
inches through its innards before it pokes out the other end.

Blood spurts on Call, on the floor.  The creature wriggles and finally 
falls free as the stilletto melts inside it.

JOHNER

Vriess!  Get behind the fucking wheel!

CUT TO: INT.  VERTICAL AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Ripley is climbing up the cramped vent with the speed and agility of an 
alien.

Unfortunately, so are the aliens, twenty feet below her.  Two drones in 
front, with the newborn sqeezing close behind.

Ripley grabs a pole and her hand begins to steam, it's so hot. She 
cries out, lets go...  then looks down.  Grabs the pole again and, 
ignoring the searing agony, pulls, pulls...

RIPS out of the wall, burning steam GUSHING out below her, slowing down 
the aliens.

She continues climbing, then kicks through a grate.

CUT TO:

The Auriga races toward:

EARTH.  But not as we've seen it.

The planet is still blue, but almost two thirds of it is obscured by a

faster than the  planet itself.

The Auriga heads for a section of exposed earth.  Not long now.

CUT TO: INT.  ANTE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Ripley drops to the ground and heads for the dock.

CALL/SHIP

Airlock doors closing.  Stand clear.

RIPLEY

No!

She doesn't bother to try the door, she HURLS herself through the 
window, landing

in a hail of glass.

She is on the platform that. runs the length of the dock.  Betty. is 
barely visible past the far end, - sinking into the airlock as the 
massive airlock doors. slide slowly shut.

RIPLEY

NO!!

A SLAM against the metal door behind her tells her the aliens are here.

She picks herself up and RUNS -- and she can run fast.

Speeds across the platform, faster, faster, the Betty sinks of sight as 
the airlock doors move closer together, fifteen feet apart, ten...

Ripley reaches the edge of the platform and LEAPS, just hurls herself 
off of the platform, sails through the air, thirty, forty feet, and 
down, the airlock doors thirty feet below almost closed

She DROPS right through just before they close, falls another fifteen 
feet and lands

-- WHAM!! -- on top of-the Auriga, hard, rolls, lies there in extremes 
of pain.

just barely hold on, Ripley's body thrown straight up as she grips the 
hatch door for dear life.

The newborn has a better grip -- it has more things to grip with but it 
too struggles with the sudden drop.

Speeding toward the earth.  The Betty SHOOTS out the airlock and nearly 
smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes, like trash thrown out

An instrument panel suddenly SPARKS beside her warning lights flash, 
the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence

CALL

Johner!  Fire!

VRIESS

Vector control's fucked! we gotta put down!

Find me a path!

Johner sprays foam on the fire.  There is a loud BANGING heard far 
overhead.

What the fuck is that?

ANGLE: RIPLEY

is slamming her fist on the hatch doors, hanging on with her other arm.

The ship continues to tremble and buck -- she's nearly thrown off.

RIPLEY

Godamnit!

She looks around at the alien.  It's almost on her.

Working its way painfully toward her, gripping with its legs and 
tendrils.  Hissing.

It slams a tentacle down at Ripley, but she rolls, just holding on

ANGLE: JOHNER

Above the cockpit, looking at a fuzzy external monitor.

JOHNER

It's Ripley!  Ripley's on the fucking hatch!

In the cockpit, Call nearly goes white.

CALL

Let her in!

JOHNER

Fuck no!  There's something else out there with her!

VRIESS

One of them.

Johner looks at the image, realizes how masive the newborn is. 

Awed fear creeps into his voice: 

JOHNER

No. it's something else.

Frustrated, Call jumps out of her seat.. Vriess fights to control the 
ship as she  climbs up toward the hatch.

VRIESS

Goddamnit, Call!

Johner grabs her, practically throws her at the monitor.

JOHNER

Look at that fucking thing!  We can't open up!

They both tumble as the ship jerks

ANGLE: RIPLEY

Is bucked OFF THE SHIP

before she grabs the newborn's tentacle, holds on to it --

The newborn SMASHES it against he ship, trying to shake her again -

- she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away.

Pushes Johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence.

ANGLE: VRIESS.

Desperately pulling up as wooded, snowy mountains zoom dangerously 
close below.

ANGLE: THE ALIEN

Turns as the HATCH OPENS nearby, the door sliding slowly beast is torn 
between Ripley and this new distraction --

Ripley sees it too, starts climbing for it frantically, one on the 
newborn.

The beast makes for the doorway -- and CALL POPS HALFWAY OUT pointing a 
GRENADE LAUNCHER  at the thing.. She BLASTS it once,  the beast roaring 
and starting back, hurt but not nearly enough.  Call fires again but 
the ships rocking sends the shot wild.

she flies back for all of a second

The beast rears to attack but Ripley is at the hatch -- Call drags her 
in and closes the hatch, the beast just SLAMMING in it as it closes.

INT.  THE BETTY

Ripley is hanging on Call, exhausted.

Another BANG on the hatch, and they can see the door starting to give.

VRIESS

Call!  NOW!

Call and Ripley head into the cockpit.Johner continues looking at the 
vidscreen at the beast.

VRIESS

We can't to do a vertical setdown! Braking systems are shot!

CALL

Find me a patch of land!  I'll put her down.

Call jumps back into the pilot's seat by Vriess.  He pulls up hard on 
the wheel, but the ship is still dangerously close to the ground.

JOHNER

That thing isn't going anywhere!

VRIESS

Johner, strap in!  We're coming down hard!

ANGLE:     -BETTY  Approaches the rough, wooded terrain, just above the 
trees.  Hits a relatively clear patch, touches down -- bounces back up 
and then down again

Fighting the wheel -- she can't pull it up hard enough.

ANGLE: THE BETTY

The ship blasts through trees.  The newborn moves to the back of the 
ship to avoid debris.

JOHNER

That things gone back behind the thrusters!

Call and Ripley look at each other.

RIPLEY

Hit it.

Call throws on the thrusters, the ship ROCKETS forward   ANGLE: THE 
NEWBOM

Engulfed in flame, losing its grip --

THE BETTY

Going too fast -- Call can't control it

VRIESS

Kill thrust! Now!

Call does.

ANGLE: THE BETTY

Skids, skids, throwing up enormous debris.  It hits another wooded area

RIPLEY

is thrown bodily into the windshield --

THE BETTY

mows down a half acre of trees before finally grinding to a halt.

As soon as they've recovered, Call throws off her seatbelt.

CALL Is everbody all right-?

JOHNER

Where're you going?

Call opens the hatch.

CALL

To make sure that thing is really dead

Its giant face LUNGES down at her, piston tongue shooting out.

It has charred black skin -- in some places that skin has fallen off 
and wet pink flesh shows through.

Call drops to the floor, the tongue just missing her.  Johner scrambles 
for his gun as

Ripley drags her out of the way.

AS quickly as it came, the head lurches back out.

JOHNER

I think it's gone!

VRIESS

No, it's waiting for us to come out!

Can we fly?

VRIESS

We can't fucking crawl!

RIPLEY

It's gone.

Call looks at her.

CALL 

Are you sure?

JOHNER

Good!  Great!

CALL

No...

Call grabs a grenade launcher.

CALL

I've got to stop it.

VRIESS

Call

CALL

That thing is thirty minutes old!  In a few hours it'll grow up.  If it 
reaches a place with people...

She heads for the door but Ripley is on her way.  They exchange a look.

RIPLEY

You'll never catch it.

Call tosses her the grenade launcher.

CUT TO: EXT.  BETTY - MOMENTS LATER

The ship sits silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow.

Ripley comes out the top.  She looks around her, sees the tracks in the 
snow.

Huge, loping.  She jumps.down off the ship.

And runs.

Through the blur of trees, she moves with the grace and speed of an 
animal, leaping from boulders, racing through the powdered brush this 
is Ripley at peak speed, and it is something to see.

She starts going up, the way getting steeper and rockier, til she 
reaches a cliff face, and looks out on:

A CITY.

Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes it's 
just before  the horizon.

The newborn RISES in front of Ripley, STRIKES her before she has a 
chance to aim her weapon.

Its tentacle cuts deeply into her, sends her flying.

The beast is on her in a second, its enormous jaws missing her head by 
an inch as she rolls, grabs the grenade launcher, FIRE

The beast is thrown, but just grazed, back on her as she tries to get 
off another shot, it SLAMS a foot down RIGHT ON HER she SCREAMS, the 
launcher rolls free, the beast coming in for the kill and over the 
ridge FLIES THE HARVESTER, Call at the controls. aiming right  for the 
newborn.

It rears up to see it just as the girl RAMS it into the creatures head, 
it knocks it on its ass, the harvester shaking but not quite spinning 
out, as Call comes around for another shot.

Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming 
harvester, it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last 
second -- The monster spins with it, screaming, sees Ripley and slashes 
at her.  KNOCKS HER OFF THE CLIFF --

She falls, grabs brush it snaps -- she starts slinding down rockface 
and she takes her hand, SLAMS her fingers into the smooth rock face 
like a pick axe -- it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase.

ANGLE: CALL

SLAMS into the newborn from behind, the girl nearly thrown out of the 
harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it, Call throws it into reverse 
but the newborn is too strong, holds on, bringing its head up to face 
Call herself.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S

Bloody and torn, it SMASHES into the rockface, as she climbs back to 
the top

ANGLE: THE NEWBORN

SWINGS the harvester into a tree, Call nearly knocked loose again. The 
monster is jolted as well, lets go, Call pilots the machine back 
through the trees, the alien watching it, growling --

Call flies deftly through the trees, away, away, then spins out, heads 
back for the beast at TOP SPEED, the wind roars as she closes

The newborn spins and she SLAMS into it, it goes flying, screaming in 
pain,  the harvester bouncing off it, flipping over, CRASHING against 
the trees and landing tilted upside down, Call unconscious between it 
and the ground.

The newborn shudders, rises, makes for the harvester -- it clearly 
pissed.

Ripley pulls herself over the ridge, sees the situation, rushes toward 
them.

Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine.  Terrified, 
but determined, she reaches for a lever

RIPLEY

No! Over here!

Calling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms.

CALL

Ripley!  Let it come!  Let it come!

Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever. The beast is 
torn, and for a  moment doesn't move.

Ripley looks over to where Call is, and understanding blooms on her 
face.

She looks around and spots:

ANGLE: THE GRENADE LAUNCHER

Halfway between her and the newborn.

For a moment neither of them moves.  Then Ripley RUNS, the newborn 
comes at her with equal speed, like they're playing chicken, Ripley 
DIVES at the ground, rolls, comes up holdin the grenade launcher, and 
she FIPES!

The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time, and it rears 
back, screaming -

- Ripley FIRES and FIRES, driving it back toward the upended harvester.

The alien rears up to its full height, and Ripley pulls.the trigger.  
There is a hollow click.

Furious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast.  A SSCREAM wells up in 
her throat and she 

THROWS herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and 
sending both  of them tumbling onto the Harvester.

Call pulls the lever.

In an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to 
top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as 
layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes.

And it SHRIEKS, a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically.

Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close -- 
but the beast grabs her, holds her.  The blades ever closer as she 
struggles with it.

ANGLE: CALL

Still trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the 
machine all around her!

She squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck.  A stream of blood 
lands on her shoulder, eating it away.  Another on her leg, and panic 
blooms, bright in her.

CALL

RIPLEY!

Galvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself out of the beast's dying 
grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and 
spark, blood eating through the controls.

Call writhes, blood everywhere now.  She is lost in primal terror.

Ripley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood 
splattering her, wrenchs Call free.  She drags her' out.

A section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the 
dying alien.

Call lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around 
her.

Covered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames, 
breathing hard,  holding each other as if their lives depended on it 
still.

DISSOLVE TO.- ANGLE: THE NEWBORN'S SKULL

Burning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it.  Collapsing 
gently on itself.

The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire, watching the flames.

Vriess tosses 'Christie a bottle of whiskey.

JOHNER

The bitch takes her time in burning.

VRIESS

Well, it looks like she's finally giving it up.

JOHNER

Troopers should be finding our ship any time now. 1 don't much love the 
idea of being around when they do.

Ripley gets up, looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city.

Christie offers the bottle to Call.  She takes it and drinks.

VRIESS (to Call)

I guess you won't want to be answering any official Questions either.

CALL

I guess not.

She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together.

VRIESS 

Well, we're on Earth, for Chrissake. Plenty of places to get lost here.

CALL

So I've heard.

After a moment, she gets up as well, goes over to Ripley.  She hands 
her the bottle.

Ripley looks at it.

CALL

It's a drink.  You drink it.

RIPLEY (smiling) I remember. She drinks.

CALL

So, what do you think?

RIPLEY

Think?

CALL

What should we do now?

RIPLEY

I don't know.

She looks out in the distance...

RIPLEY I'm a stranger here myself

The two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar 
horizon, as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame.

                                ALIENS

        FADE IN

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE                            1

        Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
        God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
        of technology.

        CLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
        ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
        or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
        of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
        engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
        over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
        toward it.

        INT. NARCISSUS                                            2

        Dark and dormant as a crypt.  The searchlights stream
        in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can
        BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling
        of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
        the hull.

        CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting
        torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the
        room.

        A second torch cuts through.  They move with machine
        precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The
        torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING
        a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER.

        FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in
        bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They
        approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

                                   LEADER
                           (filtered)
                    Internal pressure positive.  Assume
                    nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep
                    capsules, style circa late twenties...

        His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy.

        ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
        repose.

        WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
        Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

                                   LEADER
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Lights are green.  She's alive. 
                    Well, there goes out salvage, guys.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION    3 

        She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH
        raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white
        MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The Med-Tech exudes practiced
        cheeriness.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.

        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.

                                   MED-TECH
                    And how are we today?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?

        Ripley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN
        enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
        A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Jones!

        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.

        Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."

                                   MAN
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.

                                   BURKE
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.

        Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long?

        Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.

                                   BURKE
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.

        Ripley is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

                                   BURKE
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?

        Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  Burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  Ripley
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
        The Med-Tech hits a console button.

                                   MED-TECH
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                    4-1-5!

        Burke and the Med-Tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions.  A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run
        in.  Ripley's back arches in agony.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No...noooo!

        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.

                                   DOCTOR
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.

        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A MED-TECH's
        face.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.

        The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.

                                   RIPLEY
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.

        But at what price?

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. PARK                                                 4   

        Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
        beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.

        EXTREME F.G.  Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
        fallen leaves.  He leaps.  And smack into A WALL.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
        HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
        cinerama video-loop.  Ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
        somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
        Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
        VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.

        Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.

                                   BURKE
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.

        Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...

        He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy, including a telestat photo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Is she...?

                                   BURKE
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.

        Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.

        The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
        anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Amy.

                                   BURKE
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.

        Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
        past.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.

        Burke nods, a simpatico presence.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.

        Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
        lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
        this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.

        Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

                                   BURKE
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.

        INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY                                   5

        Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation
        with Burke.  DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You read my deposition...it's
                    complete and accurate.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, I believe you, but there are
                    going to be some heavyweights in
                    there.  You got Feds, you got
                    interstellar commerce commission,
                    you got colonial administration,
                    insurance company guys...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I get the picture.

                                   BURKE
                    Just tell them what happened.  The
                    important thing is to stay cool
                    and unemotional.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY                6

        She's not cool.  Not unemotional.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Do you people have earwax, of
                    what?  We have been here three
                    hours.  How many different ways
                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story?

        She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They
        aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
        PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His
        file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier
        replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
        KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
        VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
        and frowns.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Look at it from our perspective.
                    You freely admit to detonating the
                    engines of, and thereby destroying,
                    an M-Class star-freighter.  A
                    rather expensive piece of hardware...

                                   INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
                           (dryly)
                    Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
                    That's minus payload, of course.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The shuttle's flight recorder
                    corroborates some elements of
                    your account.  That the Nostromo
                    set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
                    planet, at that time.  That
                    repairs were made.  That it resumed
                    its course and was subsequently set
                    for self-destruct.  By you.  For
                    reasons unknown.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I told you...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It did not, however, contain any
                    entries concerning the hostile
                    life form you allegedly picked up.

        Ripley sense the noose tightening.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Then somebody's gotten to it...
                    doctored the recorder.  Who had
                    access to it?

        The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
        Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.

                                   ECA REP
                    Would you just listen to yourself
                    for one minute.

        Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
        side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The analysis team which went over
                    your shuttle centimeter by
                    centimeter found no physical
                    evidence of the creature you
                    describe...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (losing it) 
                    That's because I blew it out the
                    Goddamn airlock!
                           (pause)
                    Like I said.

                                   INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?

                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.

        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...

                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'

        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...

        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.

        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.

        Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration
        and anger.  Dallas looks back at her from the video
        screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             7

        Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee
        and donuts at a vending machine.

                                   BURKE
                    You had them eating out of your
                    hand, kiddo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    They had their minds made up
                    before I even went in there.
                    They think I'm a head case.

                                   BURKE
                           (cheerfully)
                    You are a head case.  Have a donut.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER            8

        Van Leuwen clears his throat.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It is the finding of this board of
                    inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
                    NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
                    judgment and is unfit to hold an
                    ICC license as a commercial flight
                    officer.

        Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped
        but subdued.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Said license is hereby suspended
                    indefinitely.  No criminal charges
                    will be filed at this time and you
                    are released on own recognizance
                    for a six month period of
                    psychometric probation, to include
                    monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
                    tech...

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             9

        DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and
        Ripley strides through.  She shrugs off Burke's
        restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (insistent)
                    Why won't you check out LV-426?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                           (condescendingly)
                    Because I don't have to.  The
                    people who live there checked it
                    out years ago and they never
                    reported and 'hostile organism'
                    or alien ship.  And by the way,
                    they call it Acheron now.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What are you talking about.
                    What people?

        Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but
        Ripley holds the door from closing.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Terraformers...planet engineers.
                    It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
                    colony.  They set up atmosphere
                    processors to make the air
                    breathable...big job.  Takes
                    decades.  They've already been
                    there over twenty years.  Peacefully.

        The door tries to close.  Ripley slams it back.  People
        are getting annoyed.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How many colonists?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Sixty, maybe seventy families.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Sweet Jesus.

                                   ELEVATOR PASSENGER
                    Do you mind?

        Ripley's hand slides off the door, strengthless.

        TIGHT ON HER  FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close
        like fate on her lost expression.

        EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY                               10

        A hideous, storm-blasted vista.  Tortured rock forms.
        Bleak twilight at midday.

        PAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete
        pylons, which reads:

                       HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
                         "WELCOME TO ACHERON"

        Some local has added below in spray-can graffiti
        "Have a nice day."  Gale-force wind SCREECHES around
        the steel sign, driving a freezing rain.

        The COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of
        floodlights.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      11

        The town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete
        buildings connected by conduits.  Neon signs throw garish
        colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and
        other businesses.  It looks like a sodden cross between
        the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in
        the Nevada boondocks.

        Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted
        "street" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.

        ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK  the largest structure.  It
        resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft
        carrier...a flying bridge.

        VISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g.,
        is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE
        PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active
        volcano.  Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover
        like a steel mill.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK                 12

        A central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping
        mall with no styling flourishes.  We SEE a cross section
        of the types of people who have come to live on
        Godforsaken Acheron.  Tough.  Pragmatic.  "Grapes of
        Wrath" faces.  Calloused hands.  Not too many interior
        decorators.  Some children race in the corridor on things
        that look suspiciously like "Big Wheels."

        INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK                     13

        Jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays...
        most of the business of running the colony flows through
        here.  It's high tech but used and scrungy.  Papers
        piled up.  Coffee cup rings.

        DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager,
        as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager,
        SIMPSON.

                                   LYDECKER
                    You remember you sent some
                    wildcatters out to that
                    plateau, out past the Ilium
                    range, a couple days ago?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Yeah.  What?

                                   LYDECKER
                    There's a guy on the horn,
                    mom-and-pop survey team.  Says
                    he's homing on something and
                    wants to know if his claim will
                    be honored.

                                   SIMPSON
                    Christ.  Some honch in a cushy
                    office on Earth says go look at
                    a grid reference in the middle
                    of nowhere, we look.  They don't
                    say why, and I don't ask.  I
                    don't ask because it takes two
                    weeks to get an answer out here
                    and the answer's always 'don't
                    ask.'

                                   LYDECKER
                    So what do I tell this guy?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
                    he finds something it's his.

        EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED     14
        TRACTOR - DAY

        It roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy
        drifts of volcanic ash.

        INT. TRACTOR                                             15

        At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN,
        independent prospector.  Beside him is his wife/partner
        ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the
        heavy sampling equipment.

                                   JORDEN
                           (gloating cackle)
                    Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
                    profile.  And it's mine, mine,
                    mine.

                                   ANNE
                    Half mine, dear.

        NEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back...

                                   NEWT
                    And half mine!

                                   JORDEN
                    I got too many partners.

                                   NEWT
                    Daddy, when are we going back
                    to town?

                                   JORDEN
                    When we get rich, Newt.

                                   NEWT
                    You always say that.  I wanna go
                    back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'

        Her older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to
        hers.

                                   TIM
                    You cheat too much.

                                   NEWT
                    Do not.  I'm just the best.

                                   TIM
                    Do too!  You go in places we
                    can't fit.

                                   NEWT
                    So!  That's why I'm the best.

                                   ANNE
                    Knock it off!  I catch either of
                    you playing in the air ducts again
                    I'll tan your hides.

                                   NEWT
                    Mom.  All the kids play it...

                                   JORDEN
                           (reverently)
                    Holy shiiit!

        ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY  ON a bizarre shape looming
        ahead.  An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from
        the bed of ash.  The tractor slows.

        Canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping
        by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an
        EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP.  Bio-mechanoid.  Nonhuman design.

                                   JORDEN
                    Folks, we have scored big this
                    time.

        EXT. TRACTOR                                             16

        Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
        Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR.  Their
        breath clouds in the chill air.

                                   ANNE
                    You kids stay inside.  I mean
                    it!  We'll be right back.

        They trudge toward the alien derelict.

                                   ANNE
                    Shouldn't we call in?

                                   JORDEN
                    Let's wait till we know what to
                    call it in as.

                                   ANNE
                           (nervous)
                    How about 'big weird thing'?

        They pause at a twisted gash in the hull.  Blackness
        inside.

        INT./EXT. TRACTOR                                        17

        Newt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it.
        Watching her parents enter the strange ship.  Tim GRABS
        HER from behind.  She SHRIEKS.

                                   TIM
                    Cheater!

        EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   18

        The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
        The wind HOWLS around them.

        Tim is curled up in the driver's seat.  Newt shakes him
        awake, trying hard not to cry.

                                   NEWT
                    Timmy...they've been gone a
                    long time.

        Tim considers the night.  The wind.  The vast landscape.
        He bites his lip.

                                   TIM
                           (quavering)
                    It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows
                    what he's doing.

        CRASH!  Newt SCREAMS as the door beside her is RIPPED
        OPEN.  A dark shape lunges inside!

        Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.

                                   ANNE
                    Mayday!  Mayday!  This is
                    Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
                    calling Hadley Control.
                    Repeat.  This is...

        As Anne shouts the mayday Newt looks past her, to the
        ground.  Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow
        by Anne from inside the ship.  There is SOMETHING ON
        HIS FACE.  An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
        with obscene life.  Newt begins to SCREAM hysterically,
        competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a
        crescendo as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY                  20

        Silence.  Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in
        the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from
        her cigarette.  The place is modest, to be charitable,
        and there are few personal touches.  Though it's late
        in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe.  The bed is
        unmade.  Dishes in the sink.  Jones prowls across the
        counter.  The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.

                                   VOICE FROM VIDEO
                           (o.s.)
                    Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the
                    family are heading off for the
                    colonies!

                                   BON
                           (o.s.)
                    Best decision I ever made, Bill.
                    We'll be starting a new life
                    from scratch, in a clean world.
                    No crime.  No unemployment...

        The door BUZZES.  Ripley jumps like a cat.  Jones doesn't.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            21

        Carter Burke stands in the narrow, dingy corridor with
        LIEUTENANT GORMAN, Colonial Marine Corps.  Young and
        severe in his officer's dress-black.  The door opens
        slightly.

                                   BURKE
                    Hi, Ripley.  This is
                    Lieutenant Gorman of the...

        SLAM.  Burke buzzes again.  Talks to the door...

                                   BURKE
                    Ripley we have to talk.
                           (pause) 
                    They've lost contact with the
                    colony on Acheron.

        The door opens.  Ripley considers the ramifications of
        that.  She motions them inside.

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER                 22

        Burke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee.  Ripley
        paces, very tense.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No.  There's no way!

                                   BURKE
                    Hear me out...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I was reamed, steamed and
                    dry-cleaned by you guys...and
                    now you want me to go back out
                    there?  Forget it.

        We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
        Burke sees it.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, we don't know what's going
                    on out there.  It may just be a
                    down transmitter.  But if it's
                    not, I want you there...as an
                    advisor.  That's all.

                                   GORMAN
                    You wouldn't be going in with the
                    troops.  I can guarantee your
                    safety.

                                   BURKE
                    These Colonial Marines are
                    some tough hombres, and they're
                    packing state-of-the-art firepower.
                    Nothing they can't handle...right,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                           (cool)
                    We're trained to deal with these
                    kinds of situations.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (to Burke)
                    What about you?  What's your
                    interest in this?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, the corporation co-financed
                    that colony with the Colonial
                    Administration, against mineral
                    rights.  We're getting into a lot
                    of terraforming...'Building Better
                    Worlds.'

        Burke is revealing his early days in sales.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

                                   BURKE
                    I heard you were working in the
                    cargo docks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (defensive)
                    That's right.

                                   BURKE
                    Running loaders, forklifts, that
                    sort of thing?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shrugging)
                    It's all I could get.  Anyway,
                    it keeps my mind off of...
                    everything.  Days off are worse.

                                   BURKE
                    What if I said I could get you
                    reinstated as a flight officer?
                    And that the company has agreed
                    to pick up your contract?

                                   RIPLEY
                    If I go.

                                   BURKE
                    If you go.
                           (pause)
                    It's a second chance, kiddo.  And
                    it'll be the best thing in the
                    world for you to face this fear
                    and beat it.  You gotta get back
                    on the horse...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (frosty)
                    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my
                    psych evaluation this month.

        Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.

                                   BURKE
                    Yes, and I've read it.  You
                    wake up every night, sheets
                    soaking, the same nightmare
                    over and over...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    No!  The answer is no.  Now
                    please go.  I'm sorry.  Just
                    go, would you.

        Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a
        TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.

                                   BURKE
                    Think about it.

        EXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                           23

        As the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN
        PITCH until we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. APARTMENT                                           24

        Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry.  She
        clutches her chest, breathing hard.  Bathed in sweat
        she lights a cigarette with trembling hands.  Do we
        hear a faint, desolate wind?

        TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE  as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
        card into a slot.  "STAND BY" prints out on the screen
        and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.

                                   BURKE
                           (on video phone)
                    Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

                                   RIPLEY
                    Burke, just tell me one thing.
                    That you're going out there to
                    kill them.  Not study.  Not bring
                    back.  Just burn them out...clean
                    ...forever.

                                   BURKE
                    That's the plan.  My word on it.

        CLOSEUP - RIPLEY  taking a deep slow breath.  It's time
        to look the demon in the eye.

                                   RIPLEY
                    All right.  I'm in.

        She punches off before Burke replies, before she can
        change her mind.  She turns to Jones sitting on the
        bed and her tone becomes admonishing...

                                   RIPLEY
                    And you my dear, are staying
                    right here.

        Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes..."count me right
        out."

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER                      25

        An empty starfield.  Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.

        A mountain of steel following.  A massive military
        transport ship, the SULACO.  Ugly, battered...
        functional.

        INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK                              26

        An empty corridor, seemingly miles long.  No movement.
        The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                          27

        An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark.  Squatting
        in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles.
        DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them...
        cranes, loading equipment.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              28

        Dark electronic womb.  CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among
        murmuring instrumentation.  A sudden high-pitched
        TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.  An alarm.

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    29

        Blackness, until a bank of indicators lights up.
        Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of
        horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS.  It reaches the
        ceiling.  Locks.

        CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE  as trickles of water run
        down the frosted canopy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    30

        Lit up, white and sterile.

        The canopies of the row of capsules are raised.  Ripley
        sits up.  Rubs her arms briskly.  Next to her Gorman
        and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers,
        wearing shorts and dog tags.  They are:

           MASTER SERGEANT APONE                    UNIT LEADER

           CORPORAL HICKS                         B-TEAM LEADER

           CORPORAL DIETRICH (female)                  MED-TECH

           PFC HUDSON                                  COM-TECH 
           
           PFC VASQUEZ (female)            'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE DRAKE                   'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE FROST                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE CROWE                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE WIERZBOWSKI                          TROOPER

           CORPORAL FERRO (female)              DROP-SHIP PILOT

           PFC SPUNKMEYER                   DROP-SHIP CREW CHIEF

        The ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so
        there is no crew, except for EXECUTIVE OFFICER (ECA) Bishop,
        who supervises planetary maneuvering.

        GROANS echo across the chamber.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for
                    this shit.

        SPUNKMEYER says this sincerely, though he must have
        enlisted underage not long ago.  Looking surly, DRAKE
        sits up.  He's young as well but street-tough.  Nasty
        scar curling his lip into a sneer.

                                   DRAKE
                    They ain't payin' us enough
                    for this.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Not enough to have to wake up
                    to your face, Drake.

                                   DRAKE
                    Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look
                    like I feel.

        HICKS, an older lifer-type who keeps his own counsel,
        just snorts good-naturedly.

        Ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a
        bank of lockers.  Though not supermen they are lean and
        hardened...tough, capable, jaded.  They combine the
        specialized techno-combat training of the twenty-first
        century fighting man with those qualities universal to
        "grunts" through the ages.  SERGEANT APONE moves down the
        row of freezers.

                                   HUDSON
                    This floor's freezing.

                                   APONE
                    Christ.  I never saw such a
                    buncha old women.  You want me
                    to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    Would you, Sir?

        Ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding
        cursory hellos.  She feels isolated by the camaraderie
        of this tightknit group.

        VASQUEZ eyes her coldly as she passes.  Like Drake,
        Vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat-primer
        was the street in a Los Angeles barrio.  She is tough
        even by the standards of this group.  Hard-muscled.
        Eyes cunning and mean.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
                    mistaken for a man?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    No.  Have you?

        She slaps Drake's open palm and it clenches into a
        greeting which is part contest.  It gets rougher.
        Painful.  Until she cuffs him hard and they break with
        vicious laughter.  Dobermans playing.  Conscripted from
        juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to
        operate the formidable "SMART-GUNS."  That is part
        of their bond.

        BISHOP is helping everyone like a valet.  As he passes
        close to her Ripley notices a strange TATTOO across
        the back of his left hand...an ALPHA-NUMERIC CODE.

                                   FROST
                    Hey, hand job, you take my
                    towel?

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                           (overlapping)
                    I need some slack, man.  How
                    come they send us straight back
                    out like this?  We got some slack
                    comin', man.

                                   HICKS
                    You just got three weeks.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    I mean breathing, not this frozen
                    shit.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?

                                   APONE
                    You know it ain't up to me.
                           (louder)
                    Awright!  Let's knock off the
                    grabass.  First assembly's in
                    fifteen...let's shag it.

        INT. SHOWERS                                             31

        High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when
        you step out...a drive through car wash for people.
        Through the swirling steam Hudson, Vasquez and FERRO
        are watching Ripley dry off.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Who's the fresh meat again?

                                   FERRO
                    She's supposed to be some kinda
                    consultant...
                    (exaggerated)
                    ...She was an alien once.

                                   HUDSON
                    Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

                                   APONE
                    Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

        INT. MESS HALL                                           32

        An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers
        assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop
        and Ripley sit at another.  Everybody is nursing a
        coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF.  Among the
        troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized
        and emblazoned with patches.  Drake's tunic is cut off
        to a vest and has "Eat the apple and fuck the Corps"
        stenciled on back.  "Peace Through Superior Firepower,"
        "Pray for War" and "I've Served My Time in Hell:  Cetti
        Epsilon NC-104" are some others.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

                                   APONE
                    Rescue mission.  There's some
                    juicy colonists' daughters we
                    gotta rescue from virginity.

        Apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes.  He runs
        it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people
        are the best.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.
                    What's this crap supposed to be?

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't
                    mind getting me some more a
                    that Arcturan poontang.  Remember
                    that time?

                                   HICKS
                           (low)
                    Looks like that new Lieutenant's
                    too good to eat with us grunts.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                           (glancing
                           over shoulder)
                    Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,
                    definitely.

        Across the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with
        his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO.  Bishop
        takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and
        moves to the far side of the table.  He looks wounded.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm sorry you feel that way
                    about Synthetics, Ripley.

        Ripley spins on Burke, her tone accusing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You never said anything about an
                    android being here!  Why not?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's
                    been policy for years to have a
                    synthetic on board.

                                   BISHOP
                    I prefer the term 'artificial person'
                    myself.  Is there a problem?

                                   BURKE
                    A synthetic malfunctioned on her
                    last trip out.  Some deaths were
                    involved.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

                                   BURKE
                    Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.

        Bishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory.

                                   BISHOP
                    Well, that explains it.  The
                    A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
                    That could never happen now with
                    out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible
                    for me to harm or, by omission of
                    action, allow to be harmed a
                    human being.
                           (smiling)
                    More cornbread?

        WHAM!  Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway
        across the room.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Just stay away from me, Bishop!
                    You got that straight?

        Burke and Gorman exchange glances.

        Wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back
        to the other troopers.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    She don't like the cornbread
                    either.

        INT. READY ROOM - TIGHT ON APONE - ARMORY                33

        bellowing.

                                   APONE
                    Tench-hut!

        WIDER ANGLE  as the troops snap to from their lounging
        among the racks of high-tech weaponry.  Gorman enters
        with Burke and Ripley.

                                   GORMAN
                    At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't
                    have time to brief before we
                    left Gateway but...

                                   HUDSON
                    Sir?

                                   GORMAN
                           (annoyed)
                    Yes, Hicks?

                                   HUDSON
                    Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

                                   GORMAN
                    What's the question?

                                   HUDSON
                    Is this going to be a stand-up
                    fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

                                   GORMAN
                    All we know is that there's
                    still no contact with the colony
                    and that a xenomorph may be
                    involved.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    A what?

                                   HICKS
                           (to Wierzbowski;
                           low)
                    It's a bug-hunt.
                           (louder)
                    So what are these things?

        Gorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops.
        She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I've dictated what I know on
                    these.

                                   APONE
                    Tease us a bit.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Yeah...previews.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Okay.  It's important to understand
                    this organism's life cycle.  It's
                    actually two creatures.  The first
                    form hatches from a spore...a sort
                    of large egg, and attaches itself
                    to its victim.  Then it injects
                    an embryo, detaches and dies.
                    It's essentially a walking sex organ.
                    The --

                                   HUDSON
                    Sounds like you, Hicks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (controlled)
                    The embryo, the second form, hosts
                    in the victim's body for several
                    hours.  Gestating.  Then it...
                           (with difficulty)
                    ...then it...emerges.  Moults.
                    Grows rapidly --

                                   VASQUEZ
                    I only need to know one thing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yes?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Where they are.

        Vasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and
        blows away an imaginary alien.

                                   DRAKE
                    Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!

                                   HUDSON
                    Somebody said alien...she
                    thought they said illegal alien
                    and signed up.

                                   VASQUEZ

                                   RIPLEY
                           (icy)
                    Am I disturbing you conversation
                    Mr. Hudson?

        Hudson settles down, smirking.  Ripley locks eyes with
        Vasquez.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I hope you're right.  I really
                    do.

                                   BURKE
                           (to all)
                    I suggest you study the disks
                    Ripley has been kind enough to
                    prepare for you.

                                   GORMAN
                    Are there any questions?  Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    How do I get out of this
                    chicken-shit outfit?

        Gorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes
        over the predrop briefing.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right.  I want this to go
                    smooth and by the numbers.  I
                    want DCS and tactical database
                    assimilation by 0830.
                            (some groans)
                    Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
                    drop-ship prep details will have
                    seven hours...

        EXT. SPACE - ACHERON                                     34

        They have arrived.  From orbit the planet looks serene
        ...Pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental
        torment beneath.  The SULACO floats, its MANEUVERING
        JETS FIRING.  A bluish glow.  Then twice more, rapidly.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              35

        Bishop is installed in his command seat, hemmed in by
        instrumentation.

                                   BISHOP
                           (into mike)
                    Attention.  This concluded final
                    maneuvering operations.  Thank
                    you for your cooperation.  You
                    may resume work.

        INT. LOADING BAY - TIGHT ON MASSIVE FORKS - CARGO LOCK   34

        sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing
        CLANG.  PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is
        lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.

        Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
        ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
        it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his
        hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
        move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
        in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
        crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open
        ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
        by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
        with the driver's movements.

        You have never seen anything like this before.
        Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
        to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease.
        Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled
        "CATERPILLAR."

        Spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship
        and we become aware of the intense activity throughout
        the cavernous loading bay.  Troopers on foot or driving
        TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion.
        Hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 37

        Wierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping
        light weapons with precise movements.  Around them,
        in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal
        artillery.

        Vasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the
        authority.  Her hands move without hesitation.  CLACK.
        CLACK.  CLACK.  She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out
        on a work stand.  Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED
        SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted
        automatic weapon.  The futuristic equivalent of a .30
        caliber light machine gun.  Sort of a steadicam that
        kills.

        INT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN             38

        with pre-flight activity b.g.

                                   BURKE
                    Still nothing from the colony?

                                   GORMAN
                    Dead on all channels.

        Ripley watches the drop-ship being loaded.  A cross
        between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle
        might describe it.  An orbit-to-surface troop carrier,
        heavily armed for the close support of ground missions.
        She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's
        belly.  Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of
        incomprehensible equipment toward her.

                                   FROST
                    Clear, please.

        Ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically.  She turns.
        Steps hastily back.  Hudson cruises by with a laden
        forklift.

                                   HUDSON
                    Excuse me.

        ANGLE ON APONE  standing with Hicks, as Ripley approaches
        him

                                   RIPLEY
                    I feel like a fifth wheel
                    here.  Is there anything I can
                    do?

                                   APONE
                    I don't know.  Is there anything
                    you can do?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (pointing)
                    I can drive that loader.  I've
                    got a Class Two rating.  My
                    latest career move.

        Apone turns.  A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in
        an equipment bay.

        TWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS  skeptical.  Considering.

        TIGHT ON POWER SWITCH  as Ripley's finger punches it on.
        A RISING WHINE of power.

        TIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS  as the massive machine stirs
        to life.

        FULL, as the loader starts.  Ripley is strapped into
        the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the
        servo-sensor assemblies.  She takes a step.  BOOM!
        Two tons of hardened steel takes a step.

        Ripley spins the wrist servos.  The huge claws swing,
        open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a
        cargo module, nearby.  She raises it deftly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Where you want it?

        Hicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 39

        The troopers are suiting up for the drop.  Strapping on
        their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like
        football padding.  They tape their wrists.  Draw on
        segmented boots.  The sole cleats CLACK like hooves
        on the deck plates.  Lockers SLAM.

        WEB BELTS.  PACKS.  HARNESSES.  HELMETS.  COM-SETS.
        Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings.
        It has its own rhythm...CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.

                                   APONE
                    Let's move it, girls!  On
                    the ready line.  Let's go,
                    let's go.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40

        Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into
        the ship with the hulking troopers.  Inside they pass
        directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take
        seats facing each other across a narrow aisle.  They will
        drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for
        rapid deployment.  A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling
        depressurization of the cargo lock.

        Hudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and
        exaggerated.  Ripley watches him working his way toward
        her.

                                   HUDSON
                    I am ready, man.  Ready to get
                    it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the
                    ultimate badass...state of the
                    badass art.  You do not want to
                    fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't
                    worry.  Me and my squad of
                    ultimate badasses will protect you.
                    Check-it-out...

        He slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY
        above them.

                                   HUDSON
                    Independently targetting
                    particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!
                    Fry half a city with this puppy.
                    We got tactical smart-missles,
                    phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
                    RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic
                    ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
                    got knives...sharp sticks --

        Hicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him
        into a seat.  His voice is low, but it carries.

                                   HICKS
                    Save it.

                                   HUDSON
                    Sure, Hicks.

        Ripley nods her thanks to Hicks.  MOTORS WHINE and the
        craft lurches.  Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly
        like this is a sport fishing trip.

                                   BURKE
                    Here we go.

        She looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the
        pellet to drop.

        EXT. SULACO                                              41

        The drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive
        launch rig.  The night side of Acheron yawns below...
        enigmatic.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             42

        Ferro and Spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches.

                                   FERRO
                    Initiate release sequencer on my

        EXT. SULACO - DROP-SHIP                                  43

        Hydraulic WHINE.  Clamps SLAM BACK.  The ship drops.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     44

        Apone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold.
        Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees.
        Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           45

        It screams down through the stratosphere, plunging
        into dark turbulence.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             46

        Beyond the canopy is gray limbo.  The craft shudders
        and lurches.

                                   FERRO
                           (icy calm)
                    Switching to DCS ranging.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.
                    Picking up some hull ionization.

                                   FERRO
                    Got it.  Rough air ahead.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          47

        TIGHT ON HICKS  asleep in his harness.

                                   FERRO
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Stand by for some chop.

        TIGHT ON GORMAN  as the ship begins to buck, his eyes
        closed.  Pale.  Sweating.  He rubs his hands on his
        knees repeatedly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How may drops is this for you,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                    Thirty-eight...simulated.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    How many combat drops?

                                   GORMAN
                    Well...two.  Three, including
                    this one.

        Vasquez and Drake exchange do-you-believe-this-shit
        expressions.  Ripley looks accusingly at Burke.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             48

                                   FERRO
                    Turning on final.  Coming around to
                    a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal
                    guidance locked in.  Where's
                    the damn beacon?

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           49

        It emerges from the low cloud ceiling.  From the twilight
        haze ahead the distant colony LANDING BEACONS become
        visible.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          50

        Stumbling as the ship pitches, Ripley makes her way
        forward to the MOBILE TACTICAL OPERATIONS BAY (MTOB),
        a control console lined with monitor screens.  She
        joins Burke watching over Gorman's shoulder as the
        Lieutenant plays the board like a video director.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR CONSOLE  REVEALING screens labelled with
        the names of the troopers.  Two for each soldier.  The
        upper screens show images from the IMAGE-INTENSIFIED
        VIDEO CAMERAS in their helmets.  The lower screens are
        BIO-MONITORS:  EEG, EKG, and other graphic life-function
        readouts.  Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.

                                   GORMAN
                    Let's see.  Everybody on line.
                    Drake, check you camera.  There
                    seems to be a...

        CLOSE ON DRAKE  as he whacks himself on the head with
        an ammo case.  A familiar malfunction.

                                   GORMAN
                           (o.s)
                    ...that's better.  Pan it around
                    a bit.

                                   APONE
                    Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.
                    Let's move.  Two minutes.
                    Somebody wake up Hicks.

        A clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons.
        Vasquez and Drake buckle on their smart-gun body
        harnesses.

        Ripley watches the AP station loom on the exterior
        screens.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That the atmosphere processor?

                                   BURKE
                    Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,
                    all over the planet.  They're
                    completely automated.  We
                    manufacture them, by the way.

        EXT. SHIP - AP STATION                                   51

        The tiny ship circles the roaring tower.  A metal
        volcano thundering like the engines on God's Lear jet.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          52

        Gorman plays with the controls, zooming the image of
        the colony.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Hold at forty.  Slow circle of
                    the complex.

                                   RIPLEY                                   
                    The structure seems intact.  They
                    have power.

        On the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low
        visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Apone)
                    Okay, let's do it.

                                   APONE
                    Awright!  I want a nice clean
                    dispersal this time.

        Ripley turns as Vasquez squeezes past her.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You staying in here?

                                   RIPLEY
                    You bet.

                                   VASQUEZ
                           (turning away)
                    Figures.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Set down sixty meters this side
                    of the telemetry mast.  Immediate
                    dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
                    on station.

                                   APONE
                    Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      53

        Landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac.
        The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp.  Slams
        down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS.  The APC hits the ground
        a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps
        up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling.

        The APC pulls to the edge of the complex.  The CREW DOOR
        opens.  Troopers hit the ground running.  Spread out.
        They drop behind immediate cover.  Apone scans with
        him image intensifier visor lowered.

        APONE'S P.O.V.  through the starlight-scope visor.
        Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we
        SEE the colony buildings.  Trash blows in the street.
        No other movement.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    First squad up, on line.  Hicks,
                    get yours in a cordon.  Watch the
                    rear.

                                   APONE
                    Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

        Sprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on
        the colony main entry-lock.  Parked tightly across the
        doors are two heavy-duty tractors.  Vasquez reaches one
        of the tractors, looks inside.  The controls are ripped
        out, as if by a crowbar or axe.  She moves on.

        EXT. COLONY BUILDING                                     54

        Vasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the
        right.  Apone tries the door controls.  Nothing.

                                   APONE
                    Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.

        Hudson, all business now, moves up and studies the
        door control panel.  He pries off the facing and starts
        clipping on the bypass wires.

                                   APONE
                    First squad, assemble on me at
                    the main lock.

        The wind roars around the bleak structures.  A neon sign
        creaks overhead.  Hudson makes a connection.  The door
        shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside.  It jams
        partway open.  Apone motions Vasquez inside.  She
        eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors.
        The others follow.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Second team, move up.
                    Flanking positions.

        INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE                             55

        DOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as
        they move into the broad corridor.  A few emergency
        lights are still on.  Wind moans along the concourse.
        Pools of water cover the floor.  Farther down, rain drips
        through blast holes in the ceiling.  Evidence of a
        fire fight with pulse-rifles.

        ON VASQUEZ  moving forward.  Taut.  Alert.  Her smart-gun
        cannon swinging slowly in an arc.  She studies the
        video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead.
        Their footsteps echo.

        INT. APC                                                 56

        Ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty
        colony building.

                                   GORMAN
                    Quarter and search by twos.  Second
                    team move inside.  Hicks, take the
                    upper level.  Use your motion
                    trackers.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL                       57

        Hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level.
        They emerge cautiously.  An empty corridor recedes into
        the dim distance.  Hicks unslings a rugged piece of
        equipment.  Aims it down the hall.  He adjusts the
        "gain."  It remains silent.

                                   HICKS
                    Nothing.  No movement.

        They pass rooms and offices.  Through doors they see
        increasing signs of struggle.  Furniture overturned.
        Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles.

        INT. APC                                                 58

        Ripley et al watching.

                                   BURKE
                    Looks like my room in college.

        Nobody laughs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                        59

        Hicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms.  There are
        no bodies.  In several offices the exterior windows are
        blown out, admitting wind and rain.  Hicks picks up a
        half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with
        rainwater.

        INT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS                              60

        Apone's men are searching systematically in pairs.  They
        pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little
        more than cubicles.  Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez
        as they move forward.  Hudson touches a splash of color
        on the wall.  Dried blood.  His tracker BEEPS.

        Vasquez whirls, cannon aimed.  The BEEPING grows more
        frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door.  The
        door is splintered partway out of its frame.  Holes
        caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls.  Vasquez
        eases up to the door.  Kicks it in.  Tenses to fire.

        Inside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a
        junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a
        broken window.  It clanks against the rails of a child's
        bunkbed as it swings.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     61

        Ripley watches Hicks' monitor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Wait!  Tell him to...
                           (plugs in
                           headset jack)
                    ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left.
                    There!

        TIGHT ON MONITOR  as the image shifts, revealing a
        section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular
        pattern.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  knowing what it is.

                                   HICKS
                           (voice over;

                   You seeing this okay?  Looks
                   melted.

        Burke raises an eyebrow at Ripley.

                                   BURKE
                    Hmm.  Acid for blood.

                    Looks like somebody bagged them
                    one of Ripley's bad guys here.

        INT. FIRST LEVEL                                         62

        Hudson is looking at something.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
                    love this...

        WIDER ANGLE  showing the trooper standing beneath a
        gaping hole.  Another hole, directly beneath, is at his
        feet.  The acid has melted right down through two levels
        into the maintenance level.  Revealing pipes, conduit,
        equipment...eaten away by the ferocious substance.

                                   APONE
                    Second squad?  What's your status?

        Gorman turns to the others.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right, the area's secured.
                    Let's go in and see what their

                    First team head for operations.
                    Hudson, see if you can get their

                    the south lock by the up-link

                    He's coming in.  I feel safer
                    already.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      65

        Lights arc across the dormant buildings as the APC turns
        onto the "main drag."  It trundles down the rutted
        street, throwing up sheets of filthy water as the
        massive wheels hit pondlike potholes.  Windblown rain
        lashes across the headlights.

        Hicks emerges from the south lock just as the APC rolls
        up close to the entrance.  The crew-door slides back.
        Gorman emerges, followed by Burke, Bishop, and
        Wierzbowski.  Burke looks back to see Ripley stop in the
        APC doorway, eyeing the ominous colony structure.  She
        meets his eyes.  Shakes her head "no."  Not ready.

                                   HUDSON
                           (voice over;

                    Okay, stand by in operations.
                           (to those present)
                    Let's go.

        INT. APC                                                 66

        The crew-door cycles home with a clang.  Ripley sits in
        the dark interior, lit by the tactical displays.  The
        wind howls outside, an incredibly desolate sound.  She
        hugs herself.  Alone.  Unarmed.  She knows she's in a
        tank, but remembers the acid.  Leaps up.  Hits the door
        switch.

        EXT. APC - SOUTH LOCK                                    67

        The crew-door opens and Ripley emerges.  In time to see
        the lock doors rumbling closed.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    Burke!

        The wind snatches her words away.  The crew door whines
        shut behind her.  She walks to the exterior lock
        door-controls and studies them.  She punches some
        unfamiliar buttons.  Nothing happens.  She looks really
        nervous, alone in the howling wind.  She hits another
        button.  The door-motors come to life and she relaxes
        a little.  Glances behind her.  AND SCREAMS!  There's
        a face right there!  Right at her shoulder.  She jumps
        back, gasping for breath.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Scare you?

                    Christ, Wierzbowski!

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an
                    eye on you.

        He gestures for her to precede him inside.

        INT. CONTROL BLOCK CORRIDOR                              68

        Ripley catches up with the others as they move into the
        bowels of the complex.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Burke)
                    Looks like you company can write
                    off its share of this colony.

                                   BURKE
                           (unconcerned)
                    It's insured.

        ON RIPLEY  as they move along the corridor...reacting to
        the fact that she is back in alien country.  She sees
        the ravaged administration complex.  Fire-gutted offices.
        Hicks notices her looking around nervously.  He motions
        to big Wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually
        falls in beside her on the other side, rifle at ready.
        a two-man protective cordon.  She glances at Hicks.  He
        winks, but so fast maybe it's something in his eye.

        Trooper Frost emerges from a side corridor ahead.

                                   FRONT
                    Sir, you should check this out...

        He leads the way into the corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            69

        This wing is completely without power.  The troopers
        switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate
        a scene of devastation worse than they have seen.  Her
        expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee.

                                   FROST
                    Right ahead here...

        They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a
        hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door
        panels.  Acid holes have slashed through the floor and
        walls in several places.  The metal is scratched and
        twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like
        a soup can on one side.  They squeeze through the
        opening.

        INT. MEDICAL WING                                        70

        They pack-lights play over the devastation of the
        colonists' last ditch battle.  The equipment of the med
        labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier.  The walls
        are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid.  Scorched
        by untended fires to bare metal.  A few instruments glow
        with emergency power.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Last stand.

                    No bodies?

                                   FROST
                    No, Sir.  Looks like it was a
                    helluva fight.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  transfixed by something.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Over there.

        The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees.  She
        has entered a second room, part of the med lab area.  In
        a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
        transparent cylinders.  STASIS TUBES.  They glow faintly
        with an eerie violet light given off by the field which
        preserves the specimens inside.

        They look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS,
        the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus.
        Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
        translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like
        organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid.
        Something you definitely do not want on your face, for
        example.

                                   BURKE
                    Are these the same...?

        Ripley nods, unable to speak.  Burke leans closer in
        fascination.  His face almost touching one cylinder, is
        lit by its glow.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Watch it, Burke...

        The creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against
        the glass.  Burke jumps back.  From the palm of the
        thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE.
        like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers
        tonguelike over the inside of the glass.  Then it
        retracts into a sheath between the "gills."

                                   HICKS
                           (to Burke)
                    It likes you.

        Only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life.
        Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the
        hand-things remain inertly clenched.

                                   BURKE
                    These are dead.  There's just
                    the two alive.

        On top of each cylinder is a file folder.  Ripley takes
        a folder from above one of the live specimens.  Inside
        is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (reading)
                    Removed surgically before embryo
                    implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk,
                    John L.   Died during procedure.
                           (looking up)
                    They killed him getting it off.

                                   HICKS
                    Poor bastard.

        They are startled by a LOUD BEEP.  They turn.  Hicks
        is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the
        shattered barricade.  BEEP.  BEEP.

                                   HICKS
                    Behind us.

        He gestures at the corridor they just passed through.

                                   RIPLEY
                    One of us?

                                   GORMAN
                           (into headset)
                    Apone...where are your people?
                    Anybody in D-Block?

                                   APONE
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Negative.  We're all in Operations.

        Vasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on
        its support arm, locking it with an authoritative
        CLICK.  She and Hicks head toward the source of the
        signal, the others following.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            71

        Hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly.  They
        turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth.

        Ripley hangs back.  Then realizes there is nothing
        behind her but darkness.  She catches up to the group.

        INT. KITCHENS                                            72

        The troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the
        stainless steel surfaces.

                                   HICKS
                    It's moving.

        Vasquez is scanning, gaze intense.  The other troops
        grip their weapons tightly.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Which way?

        Hicks nods toward a complicated array of food
        processing equipment.  They move forward, weapons
        leveled.

        Ripley shuffles forward in the dark.  Wierzbowski
        trips over a metal cannister, sending it CLANGING.
        Ripley half climbs the wall.

        Hicks' tracker beeps steadily.  The beeps merge.
        Become a solid tone.  CRASH.  Something moves in the
        dark, toppling a rack of stockpots.

        ON VASQUEZ  pivoting smoothly to fire.  In the same
        instant Hicks' rifle slashes INTO FRAME.  Slams
        Vasquez' barrel upward.  A STREAM OF TRACER FIRE rips
        into the ceiling, the rounds SEARING LIKE LIGHTNING.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You fuck!

        Hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light
        under a row of steel cabinets.  He gestures to Ripley,
        who steps forward.  Trusting his judgment.  She
        crouches beside him.

        RIPLEY'S P.O.V.  lit by Hicks' pack-light...a tiny
        cowering figure.  A very dirty, very terrified
        NEWT JORDEN.  She clutches a plastic food packet in
        one hand, its top gnawed partway through.  In the other
        hand she grips the HEAD OF A LARGE DOLL, holding it by
        the hair.  Just the head.  Eyes staring.  Newt is
        pathetically emaciated...fragile-looking as Dresden
        china, her hair tangled and matted.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothingly)
                    Come on out.  It's all right...

        Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the
        cabinet.  Newt backs away, trembling visibly, her
        vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights.
        Ripley's hand almost reaches her.

        The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the
        cabinetry.  Ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her
        in sight.  Crabbing frantically sideways.  Hicks makes
        a grab, catching one tiny ankle.  He snaps his hand
        out a moment later.

                                   HICKS
                    Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.

        The girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
        baseboard, its grille kicked out.  She scrambles
        inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like
        a fish.

        In his bulky armor Hicks knows he'll never make it
        into the tiny duct.  Ripley dives.  She squirms into
        the duct without thinking.  Just ahead she sees Newt
        enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch.  Ripley
        pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it,
        and crawls in after her.

        Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel
        chamber.  Ripley shines her light around in amazement.
        It is a NEST.  A nest built by a child.  Wadded up
        blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a
        haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP
        JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a
        battery operated TAPE PLAYER.  All foraged from the
        wrecked colony.  Ripley marvels at the child's
        incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even
        in this nightmarish environment.

        Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch.

        Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug.  The
        kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets.  Eyes
        wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent.  No
        scream.

                                   RIPLEY
                    It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...
                    you're going to be all right now...
                    it's okay...you're safe...

        Newt goes limp, almost catatonic.

        CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE  her lips
        are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and
        she flinches from unseen terrors.  We READ a dark
        nightmare world in her eyes.

        Ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris...
        a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling,
        a ribbon in her hair.  In embossed gold letters
        underneath it says:

                      FIRST GRADE CITIZENSHIP AWARD
                              REBECCA JORDEN

        INT. OPERATIONS - ON NEWT - MANAGER'S OFFICE             73

        sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees.
        Looking at a point in space.

        WIDER ANGLE  REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of her
        while Dietrich watches the readouts from a
        BIO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.

                                   GORMAN
                    Now think, Rebecca.
                    Concentrate.  Just start at
                    the beginning...

        No response.  Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.

                                   GORMAN
                    Where are your parents?  You
                    have to try...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (sharply)
                    Gorman!  Give it a rest would
                    you.

        Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.

                                   GORMAN
                    Total brain-lock.

                                   DIETRICH
                           (shrugs)
                    Physically she's okay.
                    Borderline malnutrition, but
                    I don't think any permanent
                    damage.

        She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.

                                   GORMAN
                    Come on, we're wasting our
                    time.

        Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley with
        Newt.  Through the window of the office, out on the
        main floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorman
        join Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal.

        Ripley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkempt
        hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Here, try this.  A little
                    instant hot chocolate.

        She wraps the child's hands around the cup.  Raises
        it to her lips for her.  The girl drinks mechanically,
        spilling down her chin.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothing)
                    Poor thing.  You don't talk
                    much do you?  That's okay by
                    me.  Most people do a lot of
                    talking and they wind up not
                    saying very much.

        She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Uh oh.  I made a clean spot
                    here.  Now I've done it.  Guess
                    I'll just have to do the whole
                    thing.

        She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small
        cloth and gently washes the little girl's face.
        Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Hard to believe...there's a
                    little girl under all this.
                    And a pretty one at that.

        Newt gazes at her.  Ripley smiles.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                          74

        The ground teams are gathered around a terminal in
        the computer center.  Hudson has the CPU main computer
        on-line and reading out.

        INT. OFFICE                                              75

        Ripley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth,
        pink skin emerging from black grime.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I don't know how you managed
                    to stay alive but you're one
                    brave kid, Rebecca.

        Newt's voice is almost inaudible.

                                   NEWT
                    N-newt.

        Ripley leans closer.  Feels like she's breathing
        on coals.  The sound was incomprehensible.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What did you say?

                                   NEWT
                    Newt.  My n-name's Newt.
                    Nobody calls me Rebecca except
                    my dork brother.

        Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak...
        or break the spell.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, Newt it is then.  My
                   name's Ripley...and people
                   call me Ripley.

        Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it
        formally.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Pleased to meet you.  And who
                   is this?  Does she have a
                   name?

        Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched
        in one filthy hand.

                                  NEWT
                   Casey.  She's my only friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about me?

        Newt's reply is flat, neutral.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want you for a friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

                                  NEWT 
                   Because you'll be gone soon,
                   like the others.  Like
                   everybody.  You'll be dead
                   and you'll leave me alone.

        Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous
        statement and by the situation which could have
        produced this outlook in a child.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad
                   went away like that, didn't
                   they?
        
        Newt nods, staring at her knees.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (soothingly)
                   They'd be here if they could,
                   honey.  I know they would.

                                  NEWT
                          (with cold certainty)
                   They're dead.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I
                   won't leave you.  I promise.

                                  NEWT
                   You promise?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Cross my heart.

                                  NEWT
                   And hope to die?

        Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre
        expression.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   And hope to die.

        And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even
        the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished
        by a smile and a single promise.

        Newt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley.  Her lower
        lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms
        into an abject mask.  She sobs as she clamps her arms
        around Ripley's neck.  The sobs come in waves as
        Ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and
        grief and hurt rolling down her face.  It is a
        breakthrough.

        Ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise
        can be kept.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                          76

        Everyone jumps as Hudson cries out triumphantly.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and
                   drop your linen!  Found 'em.

                                  GORMAN
                   Alive?

                                  HUDSON
                   Unknown.  But, it looks like
                   all of them.  Over at the
                   processing station...sublevel
                   'C' under the south tower.

        TIGHT ON SCREEN  showing an amoebalike cluster of
        flashing blue dots clumped tightly in one area.

                                  HICKS
                   Looks like a Goddamn town
                   meeting.

                                  GORMAN
                   Let's saddle up.

                                  APONE
                   Awright, let's go girls, they
                   ain't payin' us by the hour.

        EXT. ACHERON - TWILIGHT                                  77

        The APC roars across the stygian landscape, traversing
        the causeway which connects the colony to the
        ATMOSPHERE STATION a kilometer away.  Behind it the
        drop-ship settles to the ground at the colony landing
        field.

        PAN WITH THE APC TO REVEAL the massive structure.
        Like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower
        flickers with spectral light.

        INT. APC                                                 78

        The troopers sit, more subdued now, swaying and
        bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle.  Wierzbowski
        is in the saddle.  Ripley and Newt sit side by side
        just aft of the driver's cockpit.

                                  NEWT
                   I was the best at the game.
                   I knew the whole maze.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The 'maze'?  You mean the
                   air ducts?

                                  NEWT
                   Yeah, you know.  In the walls,
                   under the floor.  I was the
                   ace.  I could hide better
                   than anybody.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're really something, ace.

        Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as the
        processing station looms ahead.

        EXT. APC/STATION                                         79

        The vast structure towers above the parked personnel
        carrier.  Deploying in front of the APC, backlit by
        its lights, the troopers cast long shadows.  They
        look ominous.  Hulking techno-samurai.

        The base of the station is a depthless maze of
        conduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery.
        Or a Dantean version of one.  The THRUM of
        functioning machine systems echoes through the
        labyrinth.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Forty meters in.  Ramp on
                   axial two-two.  Access to
                   sublevels.

        The troopers start down the open rampway.  Light
        filters down through several levels of steel mesh
        floor, catwalks and pipes.  Below that is darkness.

                                  GORMAN

        The thrumming of machines grows louder as they
        descend.

        Huddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke and
        Gorman.  Newt squeezes in from behind.  Gorman is
        doing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.

                                  GORMAN
                          (to team)
                   We're not making that out too
                   well.  What is it?

                          (voice over; static)
                   You tell me.  I only work
                   here.

        INT. COMPLEX                                             81

        The group stands before a bizarre tableau.  Among
        the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits
        something new and not of human design had been
        added.

        It is a structure of some sort, extending from and
        crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made
        of some strange encrusted substance.  It vaguely
        resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
        larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into
        the original hardware that it is hard to see where
        one ends and the other begins.

        The alien structure seems to extend far back into
        the complex of machinery.  The plant thrums loudly,
        its functioning seemingly not impaired.

        INT. APC                                                 82

        Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.

                                  GORMAN
                   What is it?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know.

                                  GORMAN

        They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their
        lights over the walls.  Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL
        LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone.  The air
        is thick with STEAM.  Trickling water.  The place
        seems almost alive.

        INT. APC                                                 84

        They watch in various helmet-camera P.O.V.'s of the
        wall detail.

                          (voice over; static)
                   Looks like some sort of secreted

                                  GORMAN
                   They ripped apart the colony
                   for building materials.

                   And the colonists...When they

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     85

        Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper
        inside.

                                  FROST
                   Hotter'n hell in here.

                   heat.

        INT. APC                                                 86

        Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic
        readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right under the
                   primary heat exchangers.

                                  BURKE
                   Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like
                   the heat, that's why they built...

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's not what I mean.  Gorman,
                   if your men have to use their
                   weapons in there, they'll rupture
                   the cooling system.

                                  BURKE
                          (realizing)
                   She's right.

                                  GORMAN
                   So.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So...then the fusion
                   containment shuts down.

                                  GORMAN
                          (impatient)
                   So?  So?

                                  BURKE
                   We're talking thermonuclear
                   explosion.

                                  GORMAN
                   Shit.

                   have any firing in there.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     87

        The troopers look at each other in dismay.

                                  WIERZBOWSKI
                   Is he fucking crazy?

                                  HUDSON
                   What're we supposed to use,
                   man?  Harsh language?

                          (voice over; static)
                   Flame-units only.  I want
                   rifles slung.

                                  APONE
                   Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

        He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines
        from each one's weapon.

        Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly.

        The three who are carrying them get out small
        incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez
        slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts
        it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs
        back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath
        attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an
        old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt
        stock.  Chambers a round.

                          (low,
                          to Hudson)
                   I always keep this handy.
                   For close encounter.

                   Let's move.  Hicks, back
                   us up.

        INT. LARGER CHAMBER                                      88

        The air is thick.  Lights flare.

                          (voice over;
                          very faint)
                   Any movement?

        Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nothing.  Zip.

        Apone stops, his expression changing.  They face a
        wall of living horror.  The colonists have been
        brought here and entombed alive...

        COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices
        of the structure.  The cocoon material is the same
        translucent epoxy.  The bodies are frozen in
        carelessly twisted positions.  Macabre image of
        frozen agony.  Many are disiccated.  Skeletal.
        Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within.
        Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death
        as hosts for the embryos growing within then.

        Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures,
        perhaps the most "recent."  A WOMAN, ghost-white
        and drained.  The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They
        seem to plead.

                                  DIETRICH
                   Sir!

        The woman's lips move feebly.

                                  WOMAN
                   Please...God...kill me.

        INT. APC                                                 89

        Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled.  The
        sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      90

        The woman begins to convulse.  She SCREAMS, a
        sawing shriek of mindless agony.

                                  APONE
                   Flame thrower!  Move!

        Frost hands it to him.  Suddenly, the woman's chest
        EXPLODES in a gout of blood.  A SMALL FANGED HEAD
        EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY.

        Apone pulls the trigger.  Then the other troopers
        carrying flame throwers open fire.  An orgy of
        purging fire.  The cocoons vanish in the shimmering
        heat.

        A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from
        fingernails on blackboards.

        ANGLE ON WALL  as something begins to emerge.  Dimly
        glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger
        then a man.  Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly
        with the convoluted surface of fused bone.  The
        troopers don't see it.  Smoke from the burning cocoons
        quickly fills the confined space.  Visibility drops
        to zero.

                                  HUDSON

                   Talk to me, Hudson.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, seems to be in front
                   and behind.

        INT. APC                                                 91

        Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the
        monitors.

                                  GORMAN
                   We can't see anything back
                   here, Apone.  What's going on?

        Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night.  Dark,
        terrifying and inevitable.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (low)
                   Pull you team out, Gorman.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER - TIGHT ON SEVERAL WALLS AND         92
        CEILING NICHES

        as they come alive.  Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift,
        becoming emerging ALIENS.  Dimly glimpsed...glints
        of slime.  Silhouettes.

                                  APONE
                   Go to infrared.  Looks sharp
                   people!

        The squad members snap down their image-intersifier
        visors.

                                  HUDSON
                   Multiple signals.  All round.
                   Closing.

        Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held
        tightly.  A nightmarish silhouette materializes out
        of the smoke behind her!  It strikes like lightning.
        SEIZES HER.  She fires reflexively, wild.  The jet
        of flame engulfs Frost nearby.

        Apone spins as the double SCREAM.  Can't see anything
        in the think smoke.

        INT. APC                                                 93

        Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black.  His
        bio-readouts flatten.  The other screens show glimpses
        of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the
        images bobbing and panning confusedly.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      94

        Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Let's rock.

        They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke
        like welders' arcs.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Who's firing?  I ordered a
                   hold fire, dammit!

        Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the
        targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting
        dance.  Thunder and lightning.  Better than sex for
        her.  FLASH-CRACK!  An alien SCREECH from the darkness.

        INT. APC                                                 95

        The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens.
        Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the
        open frequency.  Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up.
        His life signs plummet.  Voices blend and overlap.

                                  HUDSON
                          (voice over)
                   Let's get the fuck out of

                   you.  Fucking move, will you!

        Gorman is ashen.  Confused.  Gulping for air like a
        grouper.  How could the situation have unravelled
        so fast?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Gorman)

                                  GORMAN
                   Shut up.  Just shut up!

        CRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was
        pulled.  Flat line.

                                  GORMAN
                   Uh,...Apone, I want you to
                   lay down a suppressing fire
                   with the incinerators and
                   fall back by squads to the
                   APC, over.

                                  APONE

                   Say again?  All after
                   incinerators?

        Ripley watches it fall apart.

                                  GORMAN
                   I said...

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      96

        Apone adjusts his headset.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;

                   ...lay down (garbled) ...by
                   squads to...(garbled)

        Gorman's voice breaks up completely.  A SCREAM.
        Apone whirls, uncertain.

                                  APONE
                   Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound
                   off!  Wierzbowski?

        Nothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head
        off.

                                  HUDSON
                          (freaked)
                   We're getting juked!  We're
                   gonna die in here!

        Apone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home,
        looking truly terrified.

                                  APONE
                   Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck
                   the heat exchanger!

        He FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a
        horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes
        sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically
        in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own
        private video game.

        She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She
        fires "at" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish
        figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by
        Vasquez' blast.

        INT. APC                                                 97

        Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.

                                  GORMAN
                          (distantly)
                   I told them to fall back...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (viciously)
                   They're but off!  Do something!

        But he's gone.  Total brain-lock.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision.
        She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to
        do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering
        past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the
        APC.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (in passing)
                   Newt, put your seatbelt on!

        Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes
        a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches.

                                  GORMAN
                   Ripley, what the hell...?

        She slams the tractor into gear.

        EXT. APC                                                 98

        as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground.  The
        massive machine leaps forward.

        INT. APC                                                 99

        Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead
        as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway.
        She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators
        viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot.
        Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning
        his command center.

                                  GORMAN
                          (shrill)
                   What are you doing?  Turn
                   around!  That's an order!

        He claws at her, hysterical.  Burke pulls him off.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100

        The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing
        away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits
        the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes
        on the flash of weapons fire ahead.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101

        The APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks,
        supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke.
        The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door
        open.

        Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as
        they fall back.

        Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his
        smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower.

        Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and
        drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees
        a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst,
        prone.  Clean body hit.

        The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing
        open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW
        ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating
        into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops
        in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame
        thrower.

        The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls,
        engulfing the back half of the APC.

        INT. APC                                                102

        Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots
        through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire.
        Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges,
        clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her
        inside.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Drake!  He's down!

        Hicks screams right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   He's gone!  Forget it, he's
                   gone!

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (irrational)
                   No.. No, he's not.  He's --

        Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Ripley)
                   Let's go!

        Ripley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC
        bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears
        under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks
        free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly
        CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against
        the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez
        the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE.
        Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.

                                  HICKS
                   Get on the Goddamn door!

        Gorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder
        against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
        his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening,
        its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN
        MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM!
        The creature is flung backward, its shattered head
        fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door,
        the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They
        slide the door home and dog it tight.

        EXT. APC                                                103

        The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams
        into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the
        shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's
        shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium.

        INT./EXT. APC                                           104-
                                                                105

        Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang.

        Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far
        from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his
        head turns.  The small hatch against which he was
        leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out
        the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek,
        legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling
        him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and
        buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder.
        Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE
        and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up
        as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon,
        a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc.
        VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's
        armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped
        unconscious, is dragged back inside.

        The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for
        clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet.
        Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews,
        broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office
        furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in
        the APC's wake.

        Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of
        Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening,
        hideous jaws lunge inside...

        Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same
        mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams
        both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge
        wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the
        headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars
        forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal
        body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls,
        tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine
        thunders onto the causeway and away from the station.

        A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
        from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand
        back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled.

                                  HICKS
                   It's okay...we're clear.  We're
                   clear.  Ease up.

        The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she
        slows the machine.

                                  HICKS
                   Sounds like a blown transaxle.
                   You're just grinding metal.

        EXT. APC                                                106

        The tractor limps to a halt.  A HALF-KILOMETER from the
        atmosphere processing station.  The APC is a smoking,
        acid-scarred mess.

        INT. APC                                                107

        Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins
        out of her seat into the aisle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt?  Where's Newt?

        Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt
        is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat
        and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified,
        but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You okay?

        Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes
        back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and
        staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all
        back in his mind.

                                  HUDSON
                   Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
                   it.

        Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.

                                  HUDSON
                          (jerking away)
                   I'm all right, leave it!

        Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checking
        for a pulse.

                                  HICKS
                   He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.

                   He's fucking dead!

        She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly,
        ready to pulp him with her other fist.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (to Gorman)
                   Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill
                   you, you useless fuck!

        Hicks pushes her back.  Right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right
                   now.

        Vasquez releases Gorman.  His head smacks the deck.
        Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless
        purple puncture wound.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Looks like it stung him.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and
                   Dietrich aren't dead, man.

        They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing
        at the bio-function screens.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be like Gorman.  Their
                   signs are real low but they ain't
                   dead!

        Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around
        the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them
        as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just
        at the edges of their minds.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You can't help them.  Right now
                   they're being cocooned just like
                   the others.

                                  HUDSON
                          (sagging)
                   Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't
                   happening.

        Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes.  Ripley doesn't want
        it to be "I told you so" but Vasquez reads it that
        way.  She turns away with a snap.

        INT. MED LAB                                            108

        Bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a
        dissection of one of the dead parasites.  Spunkmeyer
        enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck
        and parks it near Bishop's work table.

                                  SPUNKMEYER
                   Need anything else?

        Bishop waves "no" without looking up.

        EXT. COLONY - DROP-SHIP                                 109

        Spunkmeyer emerges, crossing the Tarmac to the loading
        ramp of the ship.  As he nears the top of the ramp,
        his boot slips...skidding on something wet.  Kneeling,
        he touches a small puddle of thick slime.  He shrugs,
        and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close
        the doors.

        INT. APC                                                110

        ON VASQUEZ  wired and intense.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   All right, we can't blow the fuck
                   out of them...why not roll some
                   canisters of CN-20 down there.
                   Nerve gas the whole nest?

                                  HUDSON
                   Look, man, let's just bug out and
                   call it even, okay?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   No good.  How do we know it'll
                   effect their biochemistry?  I say
                   we take off and nuke the entire
                   site from orbit.  It's the only
                   way to be sure.

                                  BURKE
                   Now hold on a second.  I'm not
                   authorizing that action.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

        Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals
        flawlessly into conciliatory mode.

                                  BURKE
                   Well, I mean...I know this is an
                   emotional moment, but let's not
                   make snap judgments.  Let's move
                   cautiously.  First, this physical
                   installation had a substantial
                   dollar value attached to it --

                                  RIPLEY
                   They can bill me.  I got a tab
                   running.  What's second?

                                  BURKE
                   This is clearly an important
                   species we're dealing with here.
                   We can't just arbitrarily
                   exterminate them --

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bullshit!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe you haven't been keeping up
                   on current events, but we just got
                   out asses kicked, pal!

        Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.

        Burke moves in, lowering his voice.  He takes her aside
        from the others.

                                  BURKE
                   I know, I know, but we're dealing
                   with changing scenarios here.  This
                   thing is major, Ripley.  I mean
                   really major.  You gotta go with
                   its energy.  Since you are the
                   representative of the company who
                   discovered this species your
                   percentage will naturally be
                   some serious, serious money.

        Ripley stares at his like he's a particularly
        disagreeable fungus.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You son of a bitch.

                                  BURKE
                          (hardening)
                   Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks
                   has authority here.

                                  BURKE
                   Corporal Hicks!?

                                  RIPLEY
                   This operation is under military
                   jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
                   chain of command.  Right?

                                  HICKS
                   Looks that way.

        Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.

                                  BURKE
                   Look, this is a multimillion
                   dollar operation.  He can't make
                   that kind of decision.  He's just
                   a grunt!
                          (glances at Hicks)
                   No offense.

                                  HICKS
                          (coolly)
                   None taken.
                          (into mike)
                   Ferro, you copying?

                                  FERRO
                          (voice over; static)
                   Standing by.

                                  HICKS
                   Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna
                   need an immediate evac.
                          (to Burke)
                   I think we'll take off and nuke
                   the site from orbit.  It's the
                   only way to be sure.

        He winks.  Burke looks like a kid whose toy has been
        snatched.

                                  BURKE
                   This is absurd!  You don't have
                   the authority to --

        CLACK!  The sound of a rifle bolt snapping home
        truncates his rant.  Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled,
        not exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed away
        either.  Her expression is masklike.  End of discussion.

        Ripley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.

                                  RIPLEY
                   We're going home, honey.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                          111

        The ship rises through the spray thrown up by the
        downblast of the VTOL jets, hovering above the complex
        like a huge insect, its searchlights blazing.

        EXT. APC                                                112

        The group is filing out of the personnel carrier, which
        is clearly a write off.  Hicks and Hudson have Gorman
        between them, and the others emerge into the wind.
        They watch the ship roar in on its final approach.

        INT. DROP-SHOP COCKPIT                                  113

        Ferro flicks the intercom switch several times.  Thumps
        her headset mike.

                                  FERRO
                   Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.

        The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.

                                  FERRO
                          (turning)
                   Where the fu --

        Her eyes widen.  It's not Spunkmeyer.

        Am impression of leering jaws which blur forward, then
        a whirl of motion and a truncated scream.  The throttle
        levers are slammed forward in the melee.

        EXT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATION                          114

        They watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
        VEERS WILDLY.  Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and the
        craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude.
        It skims the ground.  Clips a rock formation.  The
        ship slews, sideslipping.  It hits a ridge.  Tumbles,
        bursting into flame, breaking up.  It arcs into the
        air, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Run!

        She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
        section of the ship's massive engine module slams
        into the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage.

        The drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed in
        flames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION.  A TREMENDOUS
        FIREBALL.

        The remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
        of getting off the planet, and most of their superior
        fire power, reduced to flaming debris.

        There is a moment of stunned silence, then...

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Well that's great!  That's just
                   fucking great, man.  Now what the
                   fuck are we supposed to do, man?
                   We're in some real pretty shit now!

                                  HICKS
                   Are you finished?
                          (to Ripley)
                   You okay?

        She nods.  She can't disguise her stricken expression
        when she looks at Newt, but the little girl seems
        relatively calm.  She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.

                                  NEWT
                   I guess we're not leaving, right?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'm sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   You don't have to be sorry.  It
                   wasn't your fault.

                                  HUDSON
                          (kicking rocks)
                   Just tell me what the fuck we're
                   supposed to do now.  What're we
                   gonna do now?

                                  BURKE
                          (annoyed)
                   May be could build a fire and
                   sing songs.

                                  NEWT
                   We should get back, 'cause it'll
                   be dark soon.  They come mostly
                   at night.  Mostly.

        Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station looming
        in the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jammed
        into its basal structure.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGHT                              115

        The wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings,
        dry and cold.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         116

        The weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
        stock of their grim options.  Vasquez and Hudson are
        just setting down a scorched and dented packing case,
        one of several culled from the APC wreckage.

        Hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons,
        lying on a table.

                                  HICKS
                   This is all we could salvage.  We've
                   got four pulse-rifles with about
                   fifty rounds each.  Not so good.
                   About fifteen M-40 grenades and
                   two flame throwers less than
                   half full...one damaged.  And
                   We've got four of these
                   robot-sentry units with scanners
                   and display intact.

        He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a
        high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical
        sensing equipment, packed in foam.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long after we're declared
                   overdue can we expect a rescue?

                                  HICKS
                   About seventeen days.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, we're not going to make it
                   seventeen hours!  Those things
                   are going to come in here, just
                   like they did before, man...
                   they're going to come in here
                   and get us, man, long before...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She survived longer than that
                   with no weapons and no training.

        Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So you better just start dealing
                   with it.  Just deal with it,
                   Hudson...because we need you and
                   I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now
                   get on a terminal and call up some
                   kind of floor plan file.
                   Construction blueprints,
                   maintenance schematics, anything
                   that shows the layout of this
                   place.  I want to see air ducts,
                   electrical access tunnels,
                   subbasements.  Every possible way
                   into this wing.

        Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction.
        Hicks nods approval of her handling of it.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'll be in medical.  I'd like to
                   continue my analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Fine.  You do that.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         117

        Burke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large
        HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table.
        Newt hops from one foot to the other to see.

                                  RIPLEY
                   This service tunnel is how they're
                   moving back and forth.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah, right, it runs from the
                   processing station right into
                   the sublevel here.

        He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  There's a fire door
                   at this end.  The first thing we
                   do is put a remote sentry in the
                   tunnel and seal that door.

                                  HICKS
                   We gotta figure on them getting
                   into the complex.

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.  So we put up
                   welded barricades at these
                   intersections...
                          (pointing)
                   ...and seal these ducts here
                   and here.  Then they can only
                   come at us from these two
                   corridors and we create a free
                   field of fire for the other
                   two sentry units, here.

        Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand,
        satisfied.

                                  HICKS
                   Outstanding.  Then all we need's
                   a deck of cards.  All right, let's
                   move like we got a purpose.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.

                                  NEWT
                          (imitating Hudson)
                   Aye-firmative!

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL                          118

        A long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit,
        seems to go on forever.  Vasquez and Hudson have
        finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
        tripods in the tunnel.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   Testing!

        She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the
        automatic field of fire.  The sentry guns swivel
        smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled
        by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into
        dime-sized shrapnel.  They retreat behind a heavy steel
        FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track.  Vasquez,
        using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door
        to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hudson here.  A and B
                   sentries are in place and
                   keyed.  We're sealing the
                   tunnel.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDOR                              119

        Hicks pauses in his work.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.

        He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening with
        a metal plate, welding it in place, showering sparks
        in the dark corridor.  Behind them Burke and Newt
        are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a
        hand truck, stacking it inside the operations center.
        Hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object
        out of a belt pouch.  A braceletlike EMERGENCY
        LOCATING BEEPER.

                                  HICKS
                   Here, put this on.  Then
                   I can locate you anywhere
                   in the complex on this --

        He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battle
        harness.  He shrugs, a little self-consciously.

                                  HICKS
                   Just a...precaution.  You
                   know.

        Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding him
        quizzically.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (strapping
                          it on)
                   Thanks.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, what's next?

        She consults a printout of the floor plan.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK                                      120

        The wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie
        stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud
        the complex.  Visibility is low in the fog.
        Everything looks underwater.  There is no movement.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           121

        In the barricaded corridor sentry-gun "C" sits waiting,
        its "ARMED" light flashing green.  Through a hole
        torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor
        the fog swirls in.  Water drips.  An expectant hush.

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROOM                     122

        Ripley carries an exhausted Newt through the inner
        connecting rooms of the medical wing.  She reaches
        an OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tech
        ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment.
        Several metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R.
        equipment which is pushed into one corner.

        Newt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barely
        awake...out of steam.  Ripley sets her on one of
        the cots and Newt lies down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now you just lie here and
                   have a nap.  You're exhausted.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want to...I have
                   scary dreams.

        This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but she
        feigns cheerfulness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll bet Casey doesn't have
                   bad dreams.

        Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny fingers
        and looks inside.  It is, of course, empty.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Nothing bad in here.  Maybe
                   you could just try to be like
                   her.

        Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
        Newt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull that
        five-year-old shit on me, lady.  I'm six."

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley...she doesn't have
                   bad dreams because she's just
                   a piece of plastic.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   My mommy always said there
                   were no monsters.  No real
                   ones.  But there are.

        Ripley's expression becomes sober.  She brushes damp
        hair back from the child's pale forehead.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Yes, there are, aren't there.

                                  NEWT
                   Why do they tell little kids
                   that?

        Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal.
        She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying
        as her most primal child's nightmare if not more
        so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is
        no Santa.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, some kids can't handle
                   it like you can.

                                  NEWT
                   Did one of those things grow
                   inside her?

        Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
        around her tiny body.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, Newt.  That's
                   the truth.

                                  NEWT
                   Isn't that how babies come?
                   I mean people babies...they
                   grow inside you?

                                  RIPLEY
                   No, it's different, honey.

                                  NEWT
                   Did you ever have a baby?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes.  A little girl.

                                  NEWT
                   Where is she?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Gone.

                                  NEWT
                   You mean dead.

        It's more statement than question.  Ripley nods slowly.

        She turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER
        sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed.  She
        switches it on.  It HUMS and emits a cozy orange
        glow.

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley, I was just thinking...
                   Maybe I could do you a favor and
                   fill in for her.  Just for a
                   while.  You can try it and if
                   you don't like it, it's okay.
                   I'll understand.  No big deal.
                   Whattya think?

        Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering...
        a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
        in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
        may see another dawn.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I think it's not the worst idea
                   I've heard all day.  Let's talk
                   about it later.

        She switches off the light and starts to rise.  Newt
        grabs her arm.  A plaintive voice in the dark.

                                  NEWT
                   Don't go!  Please.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll be right in the other
                   room, Newt.  And look...I can
                   see you on that camera right
                   up there.

        Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door.
        Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by
        Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it
        down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.  Take is for luck.  Now
                   go to sleep...and don't dream.

        Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging
        Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
        light on the bracelet.  The space heater hums
        comfortingly.

        INT. MED LAB                                            123

        ECU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of a
        corpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically.  The
        only sign of life.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   How is he?

        Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying
        motionless on an examining table.  Bishop looks up
        from his instruments nearby, the light of a single
        gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.

                                  BISHOP
                   I've isolated a neuro-muscular
                   toxin responsible for the
                   paralysis.  It seems to be
                   metabolizing.  He should wake
                   up soon.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now let me get this straight.
                   The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
                   carried them over there,
                   cocooned them to be hosts for
                   more of those...

        Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
        face-hugger specimens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Which would mean lots of
                   those parasites, right?  One
                   for each person...over a hundred
                   at least.

                                  BISHOP
                   Yes.  That follows.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But these things come from
                   eggs...so where are all the
                   eggs coming from.

                                  BISHOP
                   That is the question of the
                   hour.  We could assume a parallel
                   to certain insect forms who
                   have hivelike organization.
                   An ant of termite colony, for
                   example, is ruled by a single
                   female, a queen, which is the
                   source of new eggs.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're saying one of those things
                   lays all the eggs?

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, the queen is always physically
                   larger then the others.  A
                   termite queen's abdomen is so
                   bloated with eggs that it can't
                   move at all.  It is fed and tended
                   by drone workers, defended by
                   the warriors.  She is the center
                   of their lives, quite literally
                   the  mother of their society.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Could it be intelligent?

                                  BISHOP
                   Hard to say.  It may have been
                   blind instinct...attraction to
                   the heat of whatever...but she
                   did choose to incubate her eggs
                   in the one spot where we couldn't
                   destroy her without destroying
                   ourselves.  That's if she exists,
                   of course.

        Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (rising)
                   I want those specimens destroyed
                   as soon as you're done with them.
                   You understand?

        Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently
        in their cylinders.

                                  BISHOP
                   Mr. Burke have instructions
                   that they were to be kept alive
                   in stasis for return to the
                   company labs.  He was very specific.

        Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing.
        She slaps the intercom switch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      124

        In a small observation chamber separated from the med
        lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have
        squared off.

                                  BURKE
                   Those specimens are worth
                   millions to the bio-weapons
                   division.  Now, if you're smart
                   we can both come out of this
                   heroes.  Set up for life.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You just try getting a dangerous
                   organism past ICC quarantine.
                   Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

                                  BURKE
                   You've been doing your homework.
                   Look, they can't impound it if
                   they don't know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they will know about it, Burke.
                   From me.  Just like they'll know
                   how you were responsible for the
                   deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
                   colonists here --

                                  BURKE
                   Now, wait a second --

                                  RIPLEY
                          (stepping on him)
                   You sent them to that ship.  I
                   just checked the colony log...
                   directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
                   Signed Burke, Carter J.

        Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and
        rage finally have a target to focus on.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You sent them out there and you
                   didn't even warn them, Burke.
                   Why didn't you warn them?

                                  BURKE
                   Look, maybe the thing didn't even
                   exist, right?  And if I'd made it
                   a major security situation, the
                   Administration would've stepped
                   in.  Then no exclusive rights,
                   nothing.

        He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.

                                  BURKE
                   It was a bad call, that's all.

        Ripley snaps.  She slams him against the wall, surprising
        herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bad call?  These people are fucking
                   dead, Burke!  Well, they're going
                   to nail your hide to the shed...
                   and I'll be there when they do.

        She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter
        loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far
        more horrific revelation than any alien.

                                  BURKE
                          (sadly)
                   I expected more of you, Ripley.
                   I thought you would be smarter
                   than this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Sorry to disappoint you.

        She turns away and strides out.  The door closes.
        Burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           125

        Ripley is walking toward operations when a STRIDENT
        ALARM begins to sound.  She breaks into a run.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         126

        Ripley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOLE
        where Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered.  Hicks
        slaps a switch, killing the alarm.

                                  HICKS
                   They're coming.  They're in
                   the tunnel.

        The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up.
        TWO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light up
        simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
        vibrates the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing
                   on multiple targets.

        The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex.
        Their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm.
        A counter on the display counts down the number of
        rounds fired.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be wall to wall in
                   there.  Look  at those ammo counters
                   go.  It's a shooting gallery down
                   there.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUNS                 127

        blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels.  Their barrels
        are overheating, glowing cherry red.  One CLICKS empty
        and sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets it
        can't fire upon.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         128

        The digital counter on B gun reads zero.

                                  HICKS
                   B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.
                   Ten.  Five.  That's it.

        SILENCE.  Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up from
        sublevel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're at the fire door.

        The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, listen to that.

        Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wrecking
        SCREECH of claws on steel.  The intercom buzzes,
        startling them.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over)
                   Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have
                   some bad news.

                                  HUDSON
                   Well, that's a switch.

        INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATER                         129

        Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window,
        intently watching the AP station which is a dim
        silhouette in the mist.  Suddenly a column of flame,
        like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex
        at the base of the cone.

                                  BISHOP
                   That's it.  See it?  Emergency
                   venting.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long until it blows?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm projecting total systems
                   failure in a little under four
                   hours.  The blast radius will be
                   about thirty kilometers.  About
                   equal to ten megatons.

                                  HICKS
                   We got problems.

                                  HUDSON
                   I don't fucking believe this.
                   Do you believe this?

                                  RIPLEY
                   And it's too late to shut it down?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm afraid so.  The crash did too
                   much damage.  The overload is
                   inevitable, at this point.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,
                   too!  Four more weeks and out.
                   Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
                   rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Hudson, give us a break.

        They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded
        landscape.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Hicks)
                   We need the other drop-ship.  The
                   on one the Sulaco.  We have to
                   bring it down on remote, somehow.

                                  HUDSON
                   How?  The transmitter was on the
                   APC.  It's wasted.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (pacing)
                   I don't care how!  Think of a
                   way.  Think of something.

                                  HUDSON
                   Think of what?  We're fucked.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about the colony transmitter?
                   That up-link tower down at the
                   other end.  Why can't we use that?

                                  BISHOP
                   I checked.  The hard wiring
                   between here and there was severed
                   in the fighting.

        Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out
        options, grim solutions.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well then somebody's just going
                   to have to go out there.  Take a
                   portable terminal and go out there
                   and plug in manually.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, right!  Right!  With those
                   things running around.  No way.

                                  BISHOP
                          (quietly)
                   I'll go.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm really the only one qualified
                   to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
                   Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I
                   may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll
                   you need?

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Listen.  It's stopped.

        They listen.  Nothing.  An instant later comes the
        HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm.  Hicks
        looks at the tactical board.

                                  HICKS
                   Well, they're into the complex.

        INT. MED LAB                                            130

        One of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has
        yielded access to subfloor conduits.  Bishop lying in
        the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal
        as Ripley hands it down to him.  He pushes it into
        the constricted shaft ahead of him.  She then hands him
        a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
        cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.

                                  BISHOP
                   This duct runs almost to the
                   up-link assembly.  One hundred
                   eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes
                   to crawl down there.  One hour
                   to patch in and align the antenna.
                   Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
                   then about fifty minutes flight time.

        Ripley looks at her watch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's going to be closer.  You
                   better get going.

                                  BISHOP
                          (cheerfully)
                   See you soon.

        She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along
        ahead of him with a scraping rhythm.  The diameter of
        the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
        shoulders.  Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
        and begins spot welding it in place.

        INT. CONDUIT                                            131

        Bishop looks back as the welder seals him in.  He sighs
        fatalistically and squirms forward.  Ahead of him the
        conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity.  Like
        being in the bore of a very long Howitzer.

        INT. MED LAB                                            132

        Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the
        complex.

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   They're in the approach corridor.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (into mike)
                   On my way.

        Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her
        shoulder in one motion, and sprints for Operations with
        Vasquez.  The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in
        staccato bursts echoes from close by.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         133

        Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is
        mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras.
        The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
        video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
        corridor are occasionally visible.  The robot sentries
        hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into
        the swirling mist.

                                  HICKS
                   Twenty meters and closing.
                   Fifteen.  C and D guns down
                   about fifty percent.

        The digital readout whirl through descending numbers.
        An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts
        of fire.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now many?

                                  HICKS
                   Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's
                   down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

        Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly.
        The video image is a swirling wall of smoke.  Small fires
        burn, dim glows in the mist.  There are black and
        twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered
        at the edge of visibility.  However, nothing emerges
        from the wall of smoke.  The motion sensor TONE shuts off.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They retreated.  The guns stopped
                   them.

        The moment stretches.  Everyone exhales slowly.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  But look...

        The digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0"
        and "10" respectively.  Less than a second's worth of
        firing.

                                  HICKS
                   Newt time then can walk right
                   up and knock.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they don't know that.  They're
                   probably looking for other ways
                   to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Vasquez
                          and Hudson)
                   I want you two walking the perimeter.
                   I know we're all in strung out
                   shape but stay frosty and alert.
                   We've got to stop any entries before
                   they get out of hand.

        The two troopers nod and head for the corridor.  Ripley
        sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in
        one gulp.

                                  HICKS
                   How long since you slept?
                   Twenty-four hours?

        Ripley shrugs.  She seems soul weary, drained by the
        nerve-wracking tension.  When she answers, her voice
        seems distant, detached.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (grimly)
                   They'll get us.

                                  HICKS
                   Maybe.  Maybe not.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
                   those others.  You'll take care of
                   it won't you, it if comes to that?

                                  HICKS
                   If it comes to that, I'll do us
                   both.  Let's see that it doesn't
                   Here, I'd like to introduce you to
                   a close personal friend of mine.

        He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precise
        movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops
        out the magazine and hands it to her.

                                  HICKS
                   M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
                   under with a 30mm pump-action
                   grenade launcher.

        Ripley hefts the weapon.  It is heavy and awkward.  But
        there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
        cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will
        be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
        She raises it clumsily.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What do I do?

        INT. CONDUIT                                            134

        Bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
        infinities.  The pipe rings with his scraping advance.
        He approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
        shaft of light.  He puts his eyes up to the acid-etched
        opening.

        HIS P.O.V.  as drooling jaws flash toward us, SLAMMING
        against the steel with a vicious scraping SNAP.

        Bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
        inches along, looking pale and strained.  He glances at
        his watch.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         135

        Ripley has the stock of the M-41A snugged up to her cheek
        and is awkwardly trying to keep up with Hicks'
        instructions.  The Corporal is standing close behind her,
        positioning her arms.  It's intimate but that's the
        last thing on their minds.

                                  HICKS
                   Just pull it in real right.  It
                   will kick some.  When the counter
                   here heads zero, hit this...

        He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering
        on the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Just let it drop right out.  Get
                   the other one in quick.  Just
                   slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
                   Now, pull the bolt.

        CLACK.

                                  HICKS
                   You're ready again.

        Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly.  Her hands
        are trembling.  She indicates a stout TUBE underneath
        the slender pulse-rifle barrel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What's this?

                                  HICKS
                   Well, that's the grenade launcher
                   ...you probably don't want to
                   mess with that.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, you started this.  Now show
                   me everything.  I can handle myself.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  I've noticed.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           136

        DOLLYING WITH Ripley walking down the corridor, now
        carrying the newfound friend, the M-41A.  Gorman steps
        out of the door to the med lab, looking weak but sound.
        Burke is right behind him.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How do you feel?

                                  GORMAN
                   All right, I guess.  One hell
                   of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...
                   I...

                                  RIPLEY
                   Forget it.

        She shoulders by him into the med lab.  Gorman turns to
        see Vasquez staring at him with cold, slitted eyes.

                                  GORMAN
                   You still want to kill me?

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (turning away)
                   It won't be necessary.

        INT. MED LAB - ANNEX                                    137

        Ripley crosses the deserted lab, passing through the
        annex to the small O.R. where she left Newt.

        INT. MED LAB - O.R.                                     138

        Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around.
        Newt is nowhere to be seen.  On a hunch she kneels down
        and peers under the bed.  Newt is curled up there,
        jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep.  Still
        clutching "Casey."

        Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite
        the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
        the reality between dreams.  Ripley lays the rifle on
        top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without
        waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her.

        Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
        together in the darkness under their bed.

        Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some
        tormented dreamscape.  She cries out, a vague inarticulate
        plea.  Ripley rocks her gently.

                                  RIPLEY
                   There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all
                   right.

        EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139

        A VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing
        platform.  A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
        the silhouette of the station grows sharper.  Several
        systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
        conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
        the darkness.  High voltage discharges arc around the
        upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape
        with irregular glaring flashes.

        PAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G.  hunched against the wind at the
        base of the telemetry tower.  He has a TEST-BAY PANEL
        open and the portable terminal patched in.  His jacket
        is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
        it from the elements and he is typing frenetically.

                                  BISHOP
                          (to himself)
                   Now, if I did it right...

        He punches a key marked "ENABLE."

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT                       140

        The drop bay is empty and silent, with the remaining
        ship brooding in the shadows.  A KLAXON sounds and
        rotating clearance lights come on.  Hydraulics whine
        to life.  Drop-ship two moves out on its overhead track
        and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch-prep.
        Service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically
        around the hull.  A recorded announcement echoes across
        the huge chamber.

                                  FEMALE VOICE
                   Attention.  Attention.  Automatic
                   fueling operations have begun.
                   Please extinguish all smoking
                   materials.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB         141

        as she awakens with a start.  She checks her watch...
        an hour has passed.  She gently disengages herself from
        Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
        when she sees something and FREEZES.

        Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab,
        are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects.
        TWO STASIS CYLINDERS.  Their tops are hinged open, and
        the suspension fields are switched off.  They are both
        EMPTY.  Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
        rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the
        inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.  Unable to
        move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing
        the situation.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Newt.  Newt, wake up.

                                  NEWT
                   Wah...?  Where are...?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in
                   trouble.

        Newt nods, now wide awake.  They listen in the darkness
        for the slightest betrayal of movement.  The scrabble
        of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.

        There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
        Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
        underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
        wall.

        The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
        is jarringly loud in the stillness.

        When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
        herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
        reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
        mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle
        is GONE.

        She snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS
        TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with
        a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above
        her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams
        the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches
        above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with
        incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
        SQUEAL.

        Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
        frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She
        flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.

        They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around
        the shadowed room where every corner of space
        between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature
        scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
        back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close
        and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in
        the room had a million volts running through it.  She
        reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing
        happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights.
        Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically
        dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the
        observation window, glancing frantically over her
        shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming
        threat.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (shouting)
                   Hey...hey!

        She pounds on the window.  Through the double
        thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and
        empty.  Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling
        behind her.  Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her
        fear.  She steps in front of the video surveillance
        camera and waves her arms in a circle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks!  Hicks!

        INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR                142

        showing Ripley waving her arms.  There is no sound,
        a surreal pantomime.

        A hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor.
        Ripley's image vanishes.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Burke straightens casually from
        the console.  Hicks is talking via headset with
        Bishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight or
        Burke's action.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.  Check back when you've
                   activated the ship.
                          (turning)
                   He's at the up-link tower.

                                  BURKE
                          (calmly)
                   Excellent.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     143

        Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
        the observation window.  It bounces back from the
        high-impact material.  She tries again.

        REVERSE ANGLE  from the med lab side, showing her
        futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK
        barely audible through the double thickness pressure
        port.

        Ripley turns, studying the room.  She fumbles through
        a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
        finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT.  Snapping it on she
        plays the beam over the walls.  Tall assemblies of
        surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
        dark.  She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements.  The
        light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing
        frantically.  Like an indicator of her growing panic.
        Newt starts a thin, high wailing.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...mommmyyyyy...

        Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and
        the child's dependence on her.  She plays the beam
        across the ceiling.  Holds on something.  Gets an idea.
        She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
        up some papers from the counter.  Moving cautiously
        she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center
        of the room and clambers up after her.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
                   scared.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I know, honey.  Me too.

        Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
        under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
        SPRINKLER HEAD.  It triggers, spraying the room from
        several sources with water.  An ALARM sounds throughout
        the complex.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         144

        Hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finally
        identifying its source among the lights flashing on
        his board.  He bolts for the door, yelling into his
        headset as he moves.

                                  HICKS
                   Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
                   medical!  We got a fire!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     145

        Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers
        continue to drizzle in the darkness.  The SIREN
        hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley
        scans the room with her light, her hair plastered
        to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is
        eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She
        looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
        Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT
        HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
        splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles
        away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
        her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
        for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
        steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
        equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
        floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of
        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.

        She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
        its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,
        avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,
        backing away, until she is pressed up against a
        desk in one corner.

        Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
        back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around
        her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
        of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,
        knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
        Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her
        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's
        body.

        ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the
        desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking
        fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
        writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against
        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
        She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
        gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing
        itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.

        The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
        head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
        from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
        from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
        her face.

        A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
        behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.
        Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of
        pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks
        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
        into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits
        rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
        slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the
        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between
        the two of them they force is away from her face,
        though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
        sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the
        room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
        across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
        against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.

        Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,
        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
        coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,
        SHRIEKING creature.

                                  HICKS
                   The corner!  Ready?

                                  HUDSON
                   Do it!

        Hicks hurls the thing into the corner.  It scrabbles
        upright in an instant and leaps back toward them.
        WHAM!  Hudson gets it clean.

        Ripley collapses, gagging.  The alarm and sprinklers
        shut off automatically.  Hicks sees the stasis
        cylinders.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (coughing)
                   Burke...it was Burke.

        INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON                       146

        looking decidedly stressed-out.  He grips his rifle
        tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.

                                  HUDSON
                          (intense)
                   I say we grease this rat-fuck
                   son of a bitch right now!

        THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a
        chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of
        sweat betray intense concealed tension.  Only a few
        minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
        adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with
        high voltage.

                                  HICKS
                          (pacing)
                   I don't get it.  It doesn't
                   make any Goddamn sense.

        Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of
        her being accusing him with absolute outrage.  Burke
        tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a
        diamond drill.  He can't.

                                  RIPLEY
                   He wanted an alien, only he
                   couldn't get it back through
                   quarantine.  But if we were impregnated
                   ...whatever you call it...and then
                   frozen for the trip back at just
                   the right time...then nobody would
                   know about the embryos we were carrying.
                   We and Newt.

        Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figure
        sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the
        proceedings with somber eyes.  She is all but lost in
        an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still
        damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.

                                  HICKS
                   Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The only way it would work is if
                   he sabotaged certain freezers
                   on the trip back.  Then he could
                   jettison the bodies and make up
                   any story he liked.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fuuuck!  He's dead.
                          (to Burke)
                   You're dogmeat, pal.

                                  BURKE
                   This is total paranoid delusion.
                   It's pitiful.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (wearily)
                   You know, Burke, I don't know
                   which species is worse.  You don't
                   see them screwing each other over
                   for a fucking percentage.

                                  HICKS
                          (serious)
                   Let's waste him.
                          (to Burke)
                   No offense.

        Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to a
        sickened emptiness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Just find someplace to lock him
                   up until it's time to --

        THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  Everyone stops in the sudden darkness,
        realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
        struggle.  Hicks looks at the board.  Everything is out.
        Doors.  Video screens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They cut the power.

                                  HUDSON
                   What do you mean, they cut the
                   power?  How could they cut the
                   power, man?  They're animals.

        Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Stay close.
                          (to the others)
                   Let's get some trackers going.
                   Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch
                   Burke.

        Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move to
        the door.  Vasquez has to slide it open manually on its
        track.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           147

        The two troopers separate and move rapidly to the
        barriers at opposite ends of the control block.

        DOLLYING WITH VASQUEZ as she moves forward with feral
        steps in the darkness.

        ON HUDSON  scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Anything?

        BEEP.  Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.

                                  HUDSON
                   There's something.

        He pans it around.  Back down the corridor.  It beep
        again, louder.

                                  HUDSON
                   It's inside the complex.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (voice over)
                   You're just reading me.

                                  HUDSON
                   No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're
                   inside.  Inside the perimeter.
                   They're in here.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?

        ANGLE ON VASQUEZ  swinging her tracker and rifle together.
        She aims it behind her.  BEEP.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (cool)
                   Hudson may be right.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         148

        Ripley and Hicks share a look..."here we go."

                                  HICKS
                          (low)
                   It's game time.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get back here, both of you.  Fall
                   back to Operations.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           149

        Hudson backtracks nervously, peering all around.  He
        looks stretched to the limit.

                                  HUDSON
                   This signal's weird...must be
                   some interference or something.
                   There's movement all over the
                   place...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Just get back here!

        Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a
        moment before Vasquez.  They pull the door shut and
        lock it.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         150

        Hudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their
        armament.  Flamethrowers.  Grenades.  M-41A magazines.
        Hudson's tracker beeps.  Then again.  The tone continues
        through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!  Signal's clean.

        He pans the scanner.  Stops.  The range display reads
        out, counting down.

                                  HUDSON
                   Range twenty meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   Seal the door.

        Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.

                                  HUDSON
                   Seventeen meters.

                                  HICKS
                   Let's get these things lit.

        He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins priming
        the other himself.  It lights with a muffled POP.
        Ripley's lights a moment later.  Sparks shower around
        Vasquez as she begins welding the door.  Hudson's tracker
        is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They learned.  They cut the power
                   and avoided the guns.  They must
                   have found another way in, something
                   we missed.

                                  HICKS
                   We didn't miss anything.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fifteen meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, an acid hole in
                   a duct.  Something under the
                   floors, not on the plans.
                   I don't know!

        She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the same
        direction as Hudson's.

                                  HUDSON
                   Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big
                   fucking signal.  Ten meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right on us.  Vasquez,
                   how you doing?

        Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
        as she welds the door shut.  Working like a demon.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nine meters.  Eight.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Can't be.  That's inside the room!

                                  HUDSON
                   It's readin' right.  Look!

        Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.

                                  HICKS
                   Well you're not reading it right!

                                  HUDSON
                   Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

        He looks at Ripley.  It dawns on both of them at the same
        time.  She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
        her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead.  The
        tone gets louder.

        Hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
        acoustic drop-ceiling.  He shines his light inside.

        HICKS' P.O.V.                                           151

        A soul-wrenching nightmare image.  Moving in the beam of
        light are aliens.  Lots of aliens.  They are crawling
        like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams
        of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy
        acoustic panels.  They glisten hideously as they claw
        their way forward in silence.  They cover the ceiling
        of the operations room.  The inner sanctum is utterly
        violated.

        ON HICKS                                                152

        blasted by fear.

        Something moves...he snaps the light around.  It's a
        meter behind him.  IT LUNGES!  He drops reflexively,
        the claws raking across his armor.

        Hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
        en masse from the handholds.  THE CEILING EXPLODES,
        raining debris.  Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
        Newt screams.  Hudson opens fire.  Vasquez grabs Hicks,
        pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower.
        Ripley scoops up Newt and staggers back.  Gorman turns
        to fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit,
        the corridor connecting to the med lab.  In the
        strobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashes
        of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the
        flamethrower fires.  They move like nothing human...
        leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
        powerful, balletic grace.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Medical!  Get to medical!

        She dashes for the corridor.

        INT. MED LAB CORRIDOR                                   153

        DOLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becoming
        a frenzied blur.  Ahead of her Burke clears the door to
        the med lab.  HE SLIDES IT CLOSED.  Ripley slams into
        the door.  Tries the latch.  Hears it LOCK from the far
        side.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!  Open the door!

                                  NEWT
                   Look!

        Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
        locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
        inhuman as you can imagine.  Strobe flashes backlight
        the demented silhouette.  Shaking, Ripley raises her
        rifle.  She squeezes the trigger.  NOTHING HAPPENS.
        The creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances.
        Ripley checks the SAFETY.  The safety is off.  The
        DIGITAL COUNTER.  The magazine is full.  Newt begins to
        wail.  Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling
        so much she almost drops the rifle.  Panic screams in
        her brain.  The thing is almost on her, filling the
        corridor, when she remembers.  She snaps the bolt back,
        chambering a round.  Whips the stock to her shoulder.
        FIRES.  FLASH-CRACK!  A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shrieking
        jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching
        insanely.

        Ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil,
        blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         154

        Hicks looks up.  Fires POINT-BLANK at a leaping
        silhouette.  SCREEEECH!  The fire-control system has
        tripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and a
        mindless SIREN wailing.  Total pandemonium.

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Let's go!  Let's go!

                                  HICKS
                   Fuckin' A!

        Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawed
        arms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down.
        Another skeletal shape leaps on him from above.  He
        disappears into the subfloor crawlway.  Hicks, Vasquez
        and Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR

        Stunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
        creature rising to advance again.  Flinching against
        blast and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with a
        BLINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle right
        up toward the ceiling.  Newt covers her ears against
        the CONCUSSION.

                                  HICKS
                          (o.s.)
                   Hold you fire!

        The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (indicating door)
                   Locked.

                                  HICKS
                   Stand back.

        Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
        lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor.
        Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings
        her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the
        launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells.

                                  GORMAN
                   You can't use those in here!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Right.  Fire in the hole!

        She pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and
        the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door
        open, molten droplets flying.

                                  HICKS
                          (shouting at Vasquez)
                   Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   What?

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156

        Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three
        grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door
        home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding
        gonglike through the metal.

        Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door.
        Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his
        hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door
        they just passed through.

        INT. MED LAB                                            157

        Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the
        dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he
        crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
        concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves
        by itself.  The door opens slowly.

        ON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We
        hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158

        The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating
        slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of
        tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and
        tugs her across the room.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on!  This way.

        She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
        expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt
        starts inside but Ripley pulls her back.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Stay behind me.

        Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before
        he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a
        tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks,
        Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back
        fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl
        rapidly through the shaft.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on.  Crawl faster.

                                  RIPLEY
                   DO you know how to get to the
                   landing field from here?

                                  NEWT
                   Sure.  Go left.

        Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is
        enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs,
        scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor
        clatters in the confined space.  They approach an
        intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the
        corner, the looks.  Clear.

                                  NEWT
                   Go right.

        They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze
        becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower
        periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by
        louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
        lower levels.

                                  HICKS
                          (into headset)
                   Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.

        There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost
        unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   Yes, I read you.  Not very well...

        EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159

        Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
        mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.

                                  BISHOP
                          (yelling;
                          over enunciating)
                   The ship is on its way.  ETA
                   about sixteen minutes.  I've
                   got my hands full flying...
                   the weather's come up a bit.

        Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
        he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry
        updates rapidly.

        In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon,
        wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges.

        INT. AIR DUCT                                           160

                                  HICKS
                   All right, stand by there.  We're
                   on out way.  Over.

        The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the
        tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure.
        A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the
        tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Back.  Go back!

        They try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them,
        the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a
        FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
        flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses
        her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks
        snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the
        duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the
        tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (icy)
                   Losing fuel.

        Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the
        glistening apparitions closing in.  Hicks' torch feathers
        out.  Empty.  Bracing his back he kicks hard at the
        cherry-hot metal.  It bends aside.

        Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and
        conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole,
        lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.
        Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez'
        flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.
        Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM
        A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.

        She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head
        to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the
        metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying
        the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.

        Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into
        her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against
        the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to
        move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and
        turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her,
        grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
        safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have
        reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him,
        barely conscious.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (hoarse whisper)
                   You always were an asshole, Gorman.

        She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE
        it as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake...
        something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip.
        He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
        creatures are upon them.

        INT. SERVICE WAY                                        161

        RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run.
        The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind
        them and they stumble with the shock wave.  Newt breaks
        out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep
        up.

                                  NEWT
                   This way.  Come on, we're almost
                   there!

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, wait!

        The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around
        obstacles.  If it wasn't clear before it's clear now
        that we are on her turf, and she's the ace.  Running on
        and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls
        a directionless blur.  Newt never hesitates.

        They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which
        runs upward at a steep 45 degrees.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  Go up.

        INT. CHUTE                                              162

        Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the
        top...an exterior vent hood.  The sound of wind booms
        down from above.  Like blowing across a bottle top
        vastly amplified.

        Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow
        side ribs in the shaft.  She looks down.  The chute
        descends far into the depths, lost in shadow.  She
        starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks,
        just emerging from the side duct.

                                  NEWT
                   Just up there --

        Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot.  She
        slides...catches herself with one hand.  Ripley reaches
        for her, dropping her light.  The hand-light goes
        skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend,
        and disappears.

        Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's.
        They miss, inches apart.

                                  NEWT
                   Riiiiipppleee --

        She slips.  Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket.
        AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT.  With an echoing scream Newt
        plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness.

        MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
        a bobsled ride.  THe shaft pitches left.  Newt bounces,
        sliding halfway up the wall.  The chute forks ahead.
        Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a
        steeper angle into the depths.  Just disappearing down
        the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light.

        Ripley looks Hicks in the eye.  And kicks free...sliding
        down the chute after Newt.  Ripley slams her feet into
        the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent.
        Ripley reaches the "V."  Sees the glow of the light in
        the left fork.  She goes left.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!

        She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it
        has no direction.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Mommy...where are you?

        Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
        intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL.  The light
        is lying there, but no Newt.  The echoing wail comes
        again.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Moooommeeee...

        Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering.  Newt's call
        comes again.  Fainter?  She can't tell.  She spins in
        a growing panic, starts the other way.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to her headset)
                   Hicks, get down here.  I need
                   that locator.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        163

        Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes
        and machines.  It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist.
        She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating.
        Ripley's voice seems to come from there.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (o.s.)
                   Newt!  Star wherever you are!

        Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     164

        Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator
        from his belt.  They follow the signal into a lighted
        area where the power apparently was not cut.

                                  HICKS
                   This way.  We're close...

        Following the signal they come to a grating set in the
        floor.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.

        Ripley runs to the grating.  Looking down she sees Newt's
        tearstreaked face.  Newt reaches up.  Her tiny fingers
        wriggle up through the bars of the grate.  Ripley
        squeezes the child's precious fingertips.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Climb down, honey.  We have to
                   cut through this grate.

        Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts
        into the bars with his hand-torch.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        165

        Newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks
        shower blindingly as Hicks cuts.  She bites her lip,
        trembling.  Cold and terrified.  Silently a glistening
        shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
        her.  It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form.  Newt
        turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the
        shadow engulfs her.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     166

        Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
        She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing
        it down.  Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley
        lunges into the hole with her light.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Newt!

        The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly.
        Newt is gone.  Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
        "Casey" the doll head.  In sinks slowly, distorting,
        vanishing in darkness.

        Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole.  She struggles
        furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  Noooo!

        He drags her back.  It takes all of his strength.

                                  HICKS
                          (intense)
                   She's gone!  Let's go!

        He sees something moving toward them through a lattice
        of pipes.  Ripley is irrational.  Hysterical.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  No!  She's alive!  We
                   have to --

                                  HICKS
                   All right!  She's alive.  I
                   believe it.  But we gotta get
                   moving!  Now!

        He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the
        end of the tunnel.  Gets her inside, slamming her against
        the back wall.  Hits the button to go to surface level.
        An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts
        toward them.  The doors are closing.  Not fast enough.
        The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on
        it.  THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature.  THE
        WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.  Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK.  It
        spins away, SCREECHING.  Acid sluices between the closing
        doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields
        Ripley with his body.  The lift starts upward.  Hicks'
        fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
        toward his skin.  Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley
        claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can.  He
        screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm.  He
        shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping
        the smoking pieces to the floor.  Acrid fumes fill the
        air, searing eyes and lungs.  The elevator stops.  The
        doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks
        who is doubled over in agony.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Come on, you can make it.
                   Almost there.

        EXT. LANDING FIELD                                      167

        Drop-ship two descends toward the landing grid,
        side-slipping in hurricane gusts.  Bishop stands, guiding
        it with the portable terminal.  The ship sets down hard.
        Slides sideways.  Stops.  Bishop turns as Ripley and
        Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
        behind him.  He goes to them, helping to support Hicks
        and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale.
        Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.

                                  RIPLEY
                   HOW MUCH TIME?

                                   BISHOP
                   PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

                                   RIPLEY
                   WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

        The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship.

        EXT. PROCESSING STATION                                 168

        An infernal engine, roaring out of control.  Steam blasts
        and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and
        columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
        the air.

        We APPROACH, hypnotically.  The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME,
        moving toward the station.  It pivots, hovering in the
        blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING
        PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third
        of the way up the enormous structure.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          169

        Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and
        drops the roll.  She has crudely fastened a M-41A
        assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower.
        A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower.  Her
        movements are curt, precise...determined.  She works
        rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other
        gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the
        drop-ship.

        Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help
        Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight
        seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around
        him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain.

                                  BISHOP
                   Ripley...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She's alive.  They brought her
                   here and you know it.

                                  BISHOP
                   In seventeen minutes this place
                   will be a cloud of vapor the
                   size of Nebraska.

        Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands
        flying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, don't let him leave.

                                  HICKS
                          (grimacing with
                          pain)
                   We ain't going anywhere.

        She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins
        to the door controls.  The door opens.  Wind and
        machine-thunder blast in.

                                  RIPLEY
                   See you, Hicks.

        Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.

                                  HICKS
                   Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.

        Ripley grabs his hand.  They share a moment, albeit
        brief.  Mutual respect in the valley of death.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Ellen.

                                  HICKS
                          (nods with
                          satisfaction)
                   Don't be long, Ellen.

        Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to the
        open doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  The doors close.

        INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR                                   170

        The elevator descends.  Bars of light move rhythmically
        across her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watching
        the landings go by.  The heat grows more intense.  Pipes
        glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows.
        The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic.

        Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
        directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and
        she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a
        determination that holds the gut-panic in check.

        The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches
        a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the
        flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the
        bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the
        MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
        jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
        forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't
        know doodley about grenades.

        This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She
        begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers
        slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends.

        The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a
        bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly,
        the doors open.

        HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
        corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
        VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent
        into Dantean Hell.  The air itself vibrates with heat
        distortion.  Couplings groan.  Machinery whines and
        throbs.  Like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
        of massive pumps echoes through the station.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           171

        Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the
        rifle.  Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the lethal
        gloom.  Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to
        hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor.  Ahead
        the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
        and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins.
        She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR,
        taped to the top of her kludge weapon.

        A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

                                  VOICE
                   Attention.  Emergency.  All
                   personnel must evacuate
                   immediately.  You now have
                   fourteen minutes to reach
                   minimum safe distance.

        INT. CATACOMB                                           172

        Range and direction read out in rapid-fire alpha-numerics
        on the locator display.

        Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the
        swirling steam of the alien maze.  She approaches an
        intersecting tunnel.  Flashing emergency lights
        illuminate the insane fresco of the walls.  She spins,
        firing the flamethrower.  Nothing there.  She whirls
        back.  Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized.

        Skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre
        tormented positions like human insects in amber.
        Steam blasts, blinding her.  The locator signal
        strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low
        passage, turns again.  At each intersection she quickly
        lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it.
        For the way back.  She has to turn sideways, inching
        through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon
        niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin.

        SUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!  A hand.
        She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in
        the wall.  Carter Burke.

                                  BURKE
                   Ripley...help me.  I can feel
                   it...inside.  Oh, God...it's
                   moving!  Oh gooood...

        She looks at him.  No one deserves this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.

        She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around
        the spoon, and pulls the primer.  She moves on.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have eleven minutes to
                   reach minimum safe distance.

        Ripley moves ahead.  The locator signals shows she is
        almost there.  A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an
        earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet.  Then
        another.  The whole station seems to shudder.  A SIREN
        begins to wail a demented rhythm.  Following the tracker
        she turns a corner and stops.  The RANGE INDICATOR READS
        ZERO.  She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer
        bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel.  All hope
        recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        173

        Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
        edge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alien
        eggs.  Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
        aware of her surroundings.  The egg nearest her
        begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at
        its top to reveal something stirring within.  Newt
        stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs
        appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.  She
        SCREAMS.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          174

        Ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        175

        Newt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward
        her.  Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap,
        and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault
        rifle.  The flash illuminates the figure of an
        adult warrior, nearby.  It spins, moving straight
        for Ripley.  Firing from the hip she drills it with
        two controlled bursts which catapult it back.  She
        steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN.  Her expression is
        murderous.  AND AGAIN.  It spins onto its back.
        She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
        a fireball.  Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing
        at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the
        child.  She swings her up onto her back.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   I knew you'd come.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, I want you to hang on,
                   now.  Hang on tight.

        Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
        of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her
        weapon.  More warriors are moving toward her among
        the eggs.  She fires the flamethrower.  The eggs are
        engulfed.  One of the warriors lunges forward, a
        living fireball.  She blasts it in half with two
        bursts from the M-41A.  Ripley retreats, ducking under
        a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK
        fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is.

        A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN
        glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
        insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the
        Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable
        horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two
        powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
        distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells
        and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
        from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
        membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
        carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes
        she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside
        the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
        eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
        where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by
        DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
        of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen.

        Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She
        fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The
        grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
        ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous
        matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes
        berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
        Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
        everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel
        in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
        vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's
        shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two
        warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
        her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL
        COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the
        magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
        and OPENS UP.

        The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley
        backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy
        of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
        long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she
        dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal
        instinct.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          176

        Ripley runs, blindly, with panting intensity verging
        on hysteria.  Impressions crash upon her...the maze
        blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with
        explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting,
        red-hot steel hissing.  Reality itself is reduced to
        a concussive series of strobelike instants of
        relentless forward motion.

        She sees one of the flares she dropped and turns.
        Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations
        of the world shake.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        177

        Lashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG
        SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
        tissue behind it.  SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke,
        it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.

        INT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR                               178-
                                                                179

        Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing
        bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at
        indistinct shapes and shadows.  The weapon is empty
        when she reaches the freight elevators.  A mass of
        debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level,
        has demolished the life cage she descended in.  She
        slams the control for the other cage and hears the
        sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its
        slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED
        SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a
        silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black
        shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE
        QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The
        flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that.
        The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and
        looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at
        the approaching FIGURE.  The elevator won't be in time.
        She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
        screech beats in her ears.  She scrambles up the
        rungs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                       180

        Ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt
        clinging to her.  She dives aside as a POWERFUL
        BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its
        razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches
        from her.  Looking down through the grille she
        sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her,
        wet and leering.  She scrambles up, running, as
        the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her
        with the titanic force of the creature below.
        It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
        metal, pacing her from below as she runs.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          181

        Ripley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and
        sprints upward.  It rocks and shudders with the
        station's death throes.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have two minutes
                   to reach minimum safe
                   distance.

        INT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS                               182-
                                                                183

        The lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open.
        The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating
        the open lift cage.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          184

        Ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the
        metals stairs.  As she rises she hears the LIFT
        MOTORS start up.  Looking down through the lattice
        work of the station she sees the life cage start
        ominously upward.  She knows there is only one
        explanation for that.  She runs on, the stairwell
        becoming a crazy whirl around her.

        EXT. LANDING PLATFORM                                   185

        Ripley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams
        through the door opening onto the platform.
        Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she
        sees...THE SHIP IS GONE.

                                  RIPLEY
                   BISHOP!

        Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred,
        outrage at the final betrayal.  She scans the sky.
        Nothing.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (hysterical)
                   BISHOP!

        Newt is sobbing.

        The lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW.  Ripley turns,
        backing away from the doors toward the railing.  There
        is no place to run to on the platform.  EXPLOSIONS
        detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
        swell upward through the machinery.  The platform bucks
        wildly.  Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
        THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL.  More
        EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below.
        Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops.  The
        safety cage parts.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt; low)
                   Close your eyes, baby.

        The lift doors begin to open.  A glimpse of the
        apparition within.

        ANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT  as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT
        BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have thirty seconds to
                   reach...

        Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
        the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  A
        TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby,
        slamming the ship sideways.  Its extended landing legs
        foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous
        squeal of metal on metal.

        INT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION                           186-
                                                                187

        Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her.  Begins
        strapping in.  Bishop wrestles with the controls.  The
        landing legs retract, ripping free.  Ripley slams her
        seat harness latches home.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Punch it, Bishop!

        The entire lower level of the station disappears in a
        fireball.  The air vibrates with intense heat waves and
        concussion.  The drop-ship engines fire.  Ripley is
        slammed back in her seat.  The ship vaults out and up,
        Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees.
        Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur.

        EXT. STRATOSPHERE                                       188

        The drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
        the clear high night.  Below, the clouds light up from
        beneath from horizon to horizon.

        A SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud
        layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME.  The tiny ship is slammed
        by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched
        but functioning, toward the stars.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          189

        Ripley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
        they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are
        finally and truly safe.  Newt starts to cry quietly,
        and Ripley strokes her hair.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's
                   over.

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER               190

        The scorched and battered ship once again sits in its
        drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the
        engine.  Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
        hypnotically.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          191

        Bishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a
        comatose Hicks.

                                  BISHOP
                   I gave him a shot, for the pain.
                   We'll need to get a stretcher to
                   cart him up to medical.

        Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down
        the aisle to the loading ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
                   but that platform was just becoming
                   too unstable...

        INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHIP                             192

        Bishop continues as they move down the ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I had to circle and hope things
                   didn't get too rough to take you
                   off.

        Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp.
        She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You did okay, Bishop.

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, thanks, I --

        He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
        ramp next to his shoe.  SSSSSS.  Acid.  SOMETHING BURSTS
        FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood.
        It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN.
        Driven right through him from behind.  Bishop thrashes,
        seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is
        slowly lifts him off the deck.  Above them the Queen
        glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
        mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay.  It blends perfectly
        with the machinery until it begins to emerge.  Seizing
        Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
        aside, shredded, like a doll.  It descends slowly to the
        deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
        limbs, dripping acid and rage.  Still smoking where Ripley
        half-fried it.  The Queen is huge, powerful...and very
        pissed off.  It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in
        inhuman geometries.

        Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring
        hypnotized...terrified to break and run.  She lowers Newt
        to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt)
                   Go!

        Newt runs for cover.  The Alien drops to the deck, pivoting
        toward the motion.  Ripley waves her arms, decoying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here!

        Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her.
        Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her.
        Its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her.  She clears
        a door.  Hits the switch.  It WHIRRS closed.  BOOM.  The
        Alien hits a moment later.

        INT. DARK CHAMBER                                       193

        Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable
        machines.

        VARIOUS ANGLES  VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing...her feet
        going into stirruplike mechanisms.  Velcro straps
        fastened over them.  Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence.
        Her hand closing on a complex grip-control.  The HUM of
        powerful motors.  The WHINE of hydraulics.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         194

        The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as
        the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
        service channels which cross the deck.  The channels are
        covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
        to crawl through.

        INT. CHANNEL                                            195

        Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
        Alien appears above, seen through the bars.  A section of
        grille is ripped away behind her.  She scrambles
        desperately.  Another section is ripped away right at her
        heels.  Light pouring in.  The next will be right above
        her.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         196

        The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her.
        The parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing
        there.

        Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL.
        THE POWER LOADER.  Like medieval armor with the power of
        a bulldozer.  She takes a step...the massive foot
        CRASH-CLANGS to the deck.  She takes another, advancing.

        Ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see...
        Hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
        child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her
        now, banishing all fear.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get away from her, you bitch!

        The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps.

        WALLOP!  A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
        it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall.  It
        rebounds into a massive backhand.  CRASH!  It goes
        backward into heavy loading equipment.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (screaming)
                   Come on!

        The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with
        unbelievable fury.  The battle is joined.

        Claws swipe, tail lashes.  Ripley parries with radical
        swipes of the steel forks.  They circle in a whirling
        blur, demolishing everything in their path.  The cavernous
        chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH,
        CLANG, SCREECH.

        They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks,
        crushing two of the creature's limbs.  It lashes and
        writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her
        exposed body.  She lifts it off the ground.  The hind
        legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting
        it in.  The striking teeth extend almost a meter from
        inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars.
        She ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
        behind her dead in a spray of drool.  Yellow acid foams
        down the hydraulic arms toward her.  The creature rips
        at high-pressure hoses.  Purple hydraulic fluid sprays
        ...machine blood mixing with alien blood.  They topple,
        off balance.  The Queen pins her.  Ripley hits a switch.
        The power loader's CUTTING TORCH flares on, directly in
        the thing's face.  They roll together, over the lip of
        a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL LOADING AIRLOCK.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       197

        They crash together four meters below, twisted in the
        loader's wreckage.  The Alien shrieks, pinned.

        Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
        and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons.
        She slaps the red "INNER DOOR OVERRIDE" and latches the
        "HOLD" locking-key down.  A KLAXON begins to sound.  She
        hits "OUTER DOOR OPEN" and there is a hurricane shriek of
        air as the doors on which they are lying separate,
        REVEALING the infinite pit of stars, below.

        All this time the Alien has been lashing at her in a
        frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
        confined space.  The airlock becomes a wind tunnel,
        blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
        from the loader.  The air of the vast ship howls past her
        into space as she claws her way up a service ladder.

        INT. CARGO BAY                                          198

        Newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
        the floor toward the airlock.   Bishop, torn virtually in
        two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind,
        grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she
        slides past him.  He catches her arm and hangs on as she
        dangles, doll-like, in the airblast.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       199

        The Alien seizes Ripley's ankle.  She locks her arms
        around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of
        their shoulder sockets.

        The door opens farther, all of space yawning below.  The
        loader tumbles clear, falling away.  It drags the Alien,
        still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the
        depths of space.  Its SHRIEK fades, it gone.

        With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air,
        crawling over the lip of the inner doorway.  She releases
        the OVERRIDE from a second panel.  The inner doors close.
        The turbulent air eddies and settles.

        She lies on her back, drained of all strength.  Gasping
        for breath.  Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop
        still holding Newt by the arm.  Encrusted with his own
        vanilla milkshake blood.  Bishop gives her a small, grim
        smile.

                                  BISHOP
                   Not bad for a human.

        He winks.

        Ripley crosses to Newt.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   Mommy...Mommy?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Right here, baby.  Right here.

        Ripley hugs her desperately.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           200

        Ripley limps along the corridor, carrying Newt on her hip.
        The ship's systems hum comfortingly.  Newt's head rests
        on her shoulder.

                                  NEWT
                   Are we going to sleep now?

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.

                                  NEWT
                   Can we dream?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

        HOLD ON THEM AS they recede down the long straight
        corridor.

                                                         FADE OUT

   
                               THE END

                                ALIENS

        FADE IN

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE                            1

        Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
        God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
        of technology.

        CLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
        ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
        or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
        of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
        engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
        over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
        toward it.

        INT. NARCISSUS                                            2

        Dark and dormant as a crypt.  The searchlights stream
        in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can
        BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling
        of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
        the hull.

        CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting
        torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the
        room.

        A second torch cuts through.  They move with machine
        precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The
        torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING
        a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER.

        FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in
        bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They
        approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

                                   LEADER
                           (filtered)
                    Internal pressure positive.  Assume
                    nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep
                    capsules, style circa late twenties...

        His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy.

        ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
        repose.

        WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
        Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

                                   LEADER
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Lights are green.  She's alive. 
                    Well, there goes out salvage, guys.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION    3 

        She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH
        raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white
        MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The Med-Tech exudes practiced
        cheeriness.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.

        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.

                                   MED-TECH
                    And how are we today?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?

        Ripley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN
        enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
        A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Jones!

        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.

        Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."

                                   MAN
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.

                                   BURKE
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.

        Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long?

        Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.

                                   BURKE
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.

        Ripley is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

                                   BURKE
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?

        Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  Burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  Ripley
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
        The Med-Tech hits a console button.

                                   MED-TECH
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                    4-1-5!

        Burke and the Med-Tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions.  A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run
        in.  Ripley's back arches in agony.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No...noooo!

        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.

                                   DOCTOR
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.

        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A MED-TECH's
        face.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.

        The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.

                                   RIPLEY
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.

        But at what price?

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. PARK                                                 4   

        Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
        beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.

        EXTREME F.G.  Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
        fallen leaves.  He leaps.  And smack into A WALL.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
        HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
        cinerama video-loop.  Ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
        somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
        Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
        VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.

        Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.

                                   BURKE
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.

        Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...

        He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy, including a telestat photo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Is she...?

                                   BURKE
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.

        Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.

        The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
        anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Amy.

                                   BURKE
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.

        Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
        past.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.

        Burke nods, a simpatico presence.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.

        Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
        lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
        this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.

        Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

                                   BURKE
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.

        INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY                                   5

        Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation
        with Burke.  DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You read my deposition...it's
                    complete and accurate.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, I believe you, but there are
                    going to be some heavyweights in
                    there.  You got Feds, you got
                    interstellar commerce commission,
                    you got colonial administration,
                    insurance company guys...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I get the picture.

                                   BURKE
                    Just tell them what happened.  The
                    important thing is to stay cool
                    and unemotional.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY                6

        She's not cool.  Not unemotional.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Do you people have earwax, of
                    what?  We have been here three
                    hours.  How many different ways
                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story?

        She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They
        aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
        PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His
        file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier
        replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
        KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
        VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
        and frowns.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Look at it from our perspective.
                    You freely admit to detonating the
                    engines of, and thereby destroying,
                    an M-Class star-freighter.  A
                    rather expensive piece of hardware...

                                   INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
                           (dryly)
                    Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
                    That's minus payload, of course.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The shuttle's flight recorder
                    corroborates some elements of
                    your account.  That the Nostromo
                    set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
                    planet, at that time.  That
                    repairs were made.  That it resumed
                    its course and was subsequently set
                    for self-destruct.  By you.  For
                    reasons unknown.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I told you...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It did not, however, contain any
                    entries concerning the hostile
                    life form you allegedly picked up.

        Ripley sense the noose tightening.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Then somebody's gotten to it...
                    doctored the recorder.  Who had
                    access to it?

        The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
        Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.

                                   ECA REP
                    Would you just listen to yourself
                    for one minute.

        Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
        side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The analysis team which went over
                    your shuttle centimeter by
                    centimeter found no physical
                    evidence of the creature you
                    describe...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (losing it) 
                    That's because I blew it out the
                    Goddamn airlock!
                           (pause)
                    Like I said.

                                   INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?

                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.

        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...

                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'

        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...

        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.

        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.

        Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration
        and anger.  Dallas looks back at her from the video
        screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             7

        Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee
        and donuts at a vending machine.

                                   BURKE
                    You had them eating out of your
                    hand, kiddo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    They had their minds made up
                    before I even went in there.
                    They think I'm a head case.

                                   BURKE
                           (cheerfully)
                    You are a head case.  Have a donut.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER            8

        Van Leuwen clears his throat.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It is the finding of this board of
                    inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
                    NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
                    judgment and is unfit to hold an
                    ICC license as a commercial flight
                    officer.

        Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped
        but subdued.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Said license is hereby suspended
                    indefinitely.  No criminal charges
                    will be filed at this time and you
                    are released on own recognizance
                    for a six month period of
                    psychometric probation, to include
                    monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
                    tech...

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             9

        DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and
        Ripley strides through.  She shrugs off Burke's
        restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (insistent)
                    Why won't you check out LV-426?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                           (condescendingly)
                    Because I don't have to.  The
                    people who live there checked it
                    out years ago and they never
                    reported and 'hostile organism'
                    or alien ship.  And by the way,
                    they call it Acheron now.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What are you talking about.
                    What people?

        Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but
        Ripley holds the door from closing.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Terraformers...planet engineers.
                    It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
                    colony.  They set up atmosphere
                    processors to make the air
                    breathable...big job.  Takes
                    decades.  They've already been
                    there over twenty years.  Peacefully.

        The door tries to close.  Ripley slams it back.  People
        are getting annoyed.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How many colonists?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Sixty, maybe seventy families.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Sweet Jesus.

                                   ELEVATOR PASSENGER
                    Do you mind?

        Ripley's hand slides off the door, strengthless.

        TIGHT ON HER  FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close
        like fate on her lost expression.

        EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY                               10

        A hideous, storm-blasted vista.  Tortured rock forms.
        Bleak twilight at midday.

        PAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete
        pylons, which reads:

                       HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
                         "WELCOME TO ACHERON"

        Some local has added below in spray-can graffiti
        "Have a nice day."  Gale-force wind SCREECHES around
        the steel sign, driving a freezing rain.

        The COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of
        floodlights.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      11

        The town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete
        buildings connected by conduits.  Neon signs throw garish
        colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and
        other businesses.  It looks like a sodden cross between
        the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in
        the Nevada boondocks.

        Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted
        "street" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.

        ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK  the largest structure.  It
        resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft
        carrier...a flying bridge.

        VISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g.,
        is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE
        PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active
        volcano.  Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover
        like a steel mill.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK                 12

        A central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping
        mall with no styling flourishes.  We SEE a cross section
        of the types of people who have come to live on
        Godforsaken Acheron.  Tough.  Pragmatic.  "Grapes of
        Wrath" faces.  Calloused hands.  Not too many interior
        decorators.  Some children race in the corridor on things
        that look suspiciously like "Big Wheels."

        INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK                     13

        Jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays...
        most of the business of running the colony flows through
        here.  It's high tech but used and scrungy.  Papers
        piled up.  Coffee cup rings.

        DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager,
        as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager,
        SIMPSON.

                                   LYDECKER
                    You remember you sent some
                    wildcatters out to that
                    plateau, out past the Ilium
                    range, a couple days ago?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Yeah.  What?

                                   LYDECKER
                    There's a guy on the horn,
                    mom-and-pop survey team.  Says
                    he's homing on something and
                    wants to know if his claim will
                    be honored.

                                   SIMPSON
                    Christ.  Some honch in a cushy
                    office on Earth says go look at
                    a grid reference in the middle
                    of nowhere, we look.  They don't
                    say why, and I don't ask.  I
                    don't ask because it takes two
                    weeks to get an answer out here
                    and the answer's always 'don't
                    ask.'

                                   LYDECKER
                    So what do I tell this guy?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
                    he finds something it's his.

        EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED     14
        TRACTOR - DAY

        It roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy
        drifts of volcanic ash.

        INT. TRACTOR                                             15

        At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN,
        independent prospector.  Beside him is his wife/partner
        ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the
        heavy sampling equipment.

                                   JORDEN
                           (gloating cackle)
                    Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
                    profile.  And it's mine, mine,
                    mine.

                                   ANNE
                    Half mine, dear.

        NEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back...

                                   NEWT
                    And half mine!

                                   JORDEN
                    I got too many partners.

                                   NEWT
                    Daddy, when are we going back
                    to town?

                                   JORDEN
                    When we get rich, Newt.

                                   NEWT
                    You always say that.  I wanna go
                    back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'

        Her older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to
        hers.

                                   TIM
                    You cheat too much.

                                   NEWT
                    Do not.  I'm just the best.

                                   TIM
                    Do too!  You go in places we
                    can't fit.

                                   NEWT
                    So!  That's why I'm the best.

                                   ANNE
                    Knock it off!  I catch either of
                    you playing in the air ducts again
                    I'll tan your hides.

                                   NEWT
                    Mom.  All the kids play it...

                                   JORDEN
                           (reverently)
                    Holy shiiit!

        ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY  ON a bizarre shape looming
        ahead.  An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from
        the bed of ash.  The tractor slows.

        Canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping
        by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an
        EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP.  Bio-mechanoid.  Nonhuman design.

                                   JORDEN
                    Folks, we have scored big this
                    time.

        EXT. TRACTOR                                             16

        Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
        Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR.  Their
        breath clouds in the chill air.

                                   ANNE
                    You kids stay inside.  I mean
                    it!  We'll be right back.

        They trudge toward the alien derelict.

                                   ANNE
                    Shouldn't we call in?

                                   JORDEN
                    Let's wait till we know what to
                    call it in as.

                                   ANNE
                           (nervous)
                    How about 'big weird thing'?

        They pause at a twisted gash in the hull.  Blackness
        inside.

        INT./EXT. TRACTOR                                        17

        Newt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it.
        Watching her parents enter the strange ship.  Tim GRABS
        HER from behind.  She SHRIEKS.

                                   TIM
                    Cheater!

        EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   18

        The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
        The wind HOWLS around them.

        Tim is curled up in the driver's seat.  Newt shakes him
        awake, trying hard not to cry.

                                   NEWT
                    Timmy...they've been gone a
                    long time.

        Tim considers the night.  The wind.  The vast landscape.
        He bites his lip.

                                   TIM
                           (quavering)
                    It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows
                    what he's doing.

        CRASH!  Newt SCREAMS as the door beside her is RIPPED
        OPEN.  A dark shape lunges inside!

        Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.

                                   ANNE
                    Mayday!  Mayday!  This is
                    Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
                    calling Hadley Control.
                    Repeat.  This is...

        As Anne shouts the mayday Newt looks past her, to the
        ground.  Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow
        by Anne from inside the ship.  There is SOMETHING ON
        HIS FACE.  An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
        with obscene life.  Newt begins to SCREAM hysterically,
        competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a
        crescendo as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY                  20

        Silence.  Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in
        the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from
        her cigarette.  The place is modest, to be charitable,
        and there are few personal touches.  Though it's late
        in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe.  The bed is
        unmade.  Dishes in the sink.  Jones prowls across the
        counter.  The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.

                                   VOICE FROM VIDEO
                           (o.s.)
                    Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the
                    family are heading off for the
                    colonies!

                                   BON
                           (o.s.)
                    Best decision I ever made, Bill.
                    We'll be starting a new life
                    from scratch, in a clean world.
                    No crime.  No unemployment...

        The door BUZZES.  Ripley jumps like a cat.  Jones doesn't.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            21

        Carter Burke stands in the narrow, dingy corridor with
        LIEUTENANT GORMAN, Colonial Marine Corps.  Young and
        severe in his officer's dress-black.  The door opens
        slightly.

                                   BURKE
                    Hi, Ripley.  This is
                    Lieutenant Gorman of the...

        SLAM.  Burke buzzes again.  Talks to the door...

                                   BURKE
                    Ripley we have to talk.
                           (pause) 
                    They've lost contact with the
                    colony on Acheron.

        The door opens.  Ripley considers the ramifications of
        that.  She motions them inside.

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER                 22

        Burke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee.  Ripley
        paces, very tense.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No.  There's no way!

                                   BURKE
                    Hear me out...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I was reamed, steamed and
                    dry-cleaned by you guys...and
                    now you want me to go back out
                    there?  Forget it.

        We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
        Burke sees it.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, we don't know what's going
                    on out there.  It may just be a
                    down transmitter.  But if it's
                    not, I want you there...as an
                    advisor.  That's all.

                                   GORMAN
                    You wouldn't be going in with the
                    troops.  I can guarantee your
                    safety.

                                   BURKE
                    These Colonial Marines are
                    some tough hombres, and they're
                    packing state-of-the-art firepower.
                    Nothing they can't handle...right,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                           (cool)
                    We're trained to deal with these
                    kinds of situations.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (to Burke)
                    What about you?  What's your
                    interest in this?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, the corporation co-financed
                    that colony with the Colonial
                    Administration, against mineral
                    rights.  We're getting into a lot
                    of terraforming...'Building Better
                    Worlds.'

        Burke is revealing his early days in sales.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

                                   BURKE
                    I heard you were working in the
                    cargo docks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (defensive)
                    That's right.

                                   BURKE
                    Running loaders, forklifts, that
                    sort of thing?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shrugging)
                    It's all I could get.  Anyway,
                    it keeps my mind off of...
                    everything.  Days off are worse.

                                   BURKE
                    What if I said I could get you
                    reinstated as a flight officer?
                    And that the company has agreed
                    to pick up your contract?

                                   RIPLEY
                    If I go.

                                   BURKE
                    If you go.
                           (pause)
                    It's a second chance, kiddo.  And
                    it'll be the best thing in the
                    world for you to face this fear
                    and beat it.  You gotta get back
                    on the horse...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (frosty)
                    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my
                    psych evaluation this month.

        Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.

                                   BURKE
                    Yes, and I've read it.  You
                    wake up every night, sheets
                    soaking, the same nightmare
                    over and over...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    No!  The answer is no.  Now
                    please go.  I'm sorry.  Just
                    go, would you.

        Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a
        TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.

                                   BURKE
                    Think about it.

        EXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                           23

        As the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN
        PITCH until we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. APARTMENT                                           24

        Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry.  She
        clutches her chest, breathing hard.  Bathed in sweat
        she lights a cigarette with trembling hands.  Do we
        hear a faint, desolate wind?

        TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE  as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
        card into a slot.  "STAND BY" prints out on the screen
        and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.

                                   BURKE
                           (on video phone)
                    Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

                                   RIPLEY
                    Burke, just tell me one thing.
                    That you're going out there to
                    kill them.  Not study.  Not bring
                    back.  Just burn them out...clean
                    ...forever.

                                   BURKE
                    That's the plan.  My word on it.

        CLOSEUP - RIPLEY  taking a deep slow breath.  It's time
        to look the demon in the eye.

                                   RIPLEY
                    All right.  I'm in.

        She punches off before Burke replies, before she can
        change her mind.  She turns to Jones sitting on the
        bed and her tone becomes admonishing...

                                   RIPLEY
                    And you my dear, are staying
                    right here.

        Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes..."count me right
        out."

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER                      25

        An empty starfield.  Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.

        A mountain of steel following.  A massive military
        transport ship, the SULACO.  Ugly, battered...
        functional.

        INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK                              26

        An empty corridor, seemingly miles long.  No movement.
        The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                          27

        An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark.  Squatting
        in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles.
        DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them...
        cranes, loading equipment.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              28

        Dark electronic womb.  CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among
        murmuring instrumentation.  A sudden high-pitched
        TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.  An alarm.

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    29

        Blackness, until a bank of indicators lights up.
        Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of
        horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS.  It reaches the
        ceiling.  Locks.

        CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE  as trickles of water run
        down the frosted canopy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    30

        Lit up, white and sterile.

        The canopies of the row of capsules are raised.  Ripley
        sits up.  Rubs her arms briskly.  Next to her Gorman
        and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers,
        wearing shorts and dog tags.  They are:

           MASTER SERGEANT APONE                    UNIT LEADER

           CORPORAL HICKS                         B-TEAM LEADER

           CORPORAL DIETRICH (female)                  MED-TECH

           PFC HUDSON                                  COM-TECH 
           
           PFC VASQUEZ (female)            'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE DRAKE                   'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE FROST                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE CROWE                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE WIERZBOWSKI                          TROOPER

           CORPORAL FERRO (female)              DROP-SHIP PILOT

           PFC SPUNKMEYER                   DROP-SHIP CREW CHIEF

        The ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so
        there is no crew, except for EXECUTIVE OFFICER (ECA) Bishop,
        who supervises planetary maneuvering.

        GROANS echo across the chamber.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for
                    this shit.

        SPUNKMEYER says this sincerely, though he must have
        enlisted underage not long ago.  Looking surly, DRAKE
        sits up.  He's young as well but street-tough.  Nasty
        scar curling his lip into a sneer.

                                   DRAKE
                    They ain't payin' us enough
                    for this.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Not enough to have to wake up
                    to your face, Drake.

                                   DRAKE
                    Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look
                    like I feel.

        HICKS, an older lifer-type who keeps his own counsel,
        just snorts good-naturedly.

        Ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a
        bank of lockers.  Though not supermen they are lean and
        hardened...tough, capable, jaded.  They combine the
        specialized techno-combat training of the twenty-first
        century fighting man with those qualities universal to
        "grunts" through the ages.  SERGEANT APONE moves down the
        row of freezers.

                                   HUDSON
                    This floor's freezing.

                                   APONE
                    Christ.  I never saw such a
                    buncha old women.  You want me
                    to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    Would you, Sir?

        Ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding
        cursory hellos.  She feels isolated by the camaraderie
        of this tightknit group.

        VASQUEZ eyes her coldly as she passes.  Like Drake,
        Vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat-primer
        was the street in a Los Angeles barrio.  She is tough
        even by the standards of this group.  Hard-muscled.
        Eyes cunning and mean.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
                    mistaken for a man?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    No.  Have you?

        She slaps Drake's open palm and it clenches into a
        greeting which is part contest.  It gets rougher.
        Painful.  Until she cuffs him hard and they break with
        vicious laughter.  Dobermans playing.  Conscripted from
        juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to
        operate the formidable "SMART-GUNS."  That is part
        of their bond.

        BISHOP is helping everyone like a valet.  As he passes
        close to her Ripley notices a strange TATTOO across
        the back of his left hand...an ALPHA-NUMERIC CODE.

                                   FROST
                    Hey, hand job, you take my
                    towel?

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                           (overlapping)
                    I need some slack, man.  How
                    come they send us straight back
                    out like this?  We got some slack
                    comin', man.

                                   HICKS
                    You just got three weeks.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    I mean breathing, not this frozen
                    shit.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?

                                   APONE
                    You know it ain't up to me.
                           (louder)
                    Awright!  Let's knock off the
                    grabass.  First assembly's in
                    fifteen...let's shag it.

        INT. SHOWERS                                             31

        High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when
        you step out...a drive through car wash for people.
        Through the swirling steam Hudson, Vasquez and FERRO
        are watching Ripley dry off.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Who's the fresh meat again?

                                   FERRO
                    She's supposed to be some kinda
                    consultant...
                    (exaggerated)
                    ...She was an alien once.

                                   HUDSON
                    Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

                                   APONE
                    Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

        INT. MESS HALL                                           32

        An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers
        assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop
        and Ripley sit at another.  Everybody is nursing a
        coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF.  Among the
        troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized
        and emblazoned with patches.  Drake's tunic is cut off
        to a vest and has "Eat the apple and fuck the Corps"
        stenciled on back.  "Peace Through Superior Firepower,"
        "Pray for War" and "I've Served My Time in Hell:  Cetti
        Epsilon NC-104" are some others.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

                                   APONE
                    Rescue mission.  There's some
                    juicy colonists' daughters we
                    gotta rescue from virginity.

        Apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes.  He runs
        it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people
        are the best.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.
                    What's this crap supposed to be?

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't
                    mind getting me some more a
                    that Arcturan poontang.  Remember
                    that time?

                                   HICKS
                           (low)
                    Looks like that new Lieutenant's
                    too good to eat with us grunts.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                           (glancing
                           over shoulder)
                    Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,
                    definitely.

        Across the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with
        his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO.  Bishop
        takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and
        moves to the far side of the table.  He looks wounded.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm sorry you feel that way
                    about Synthetics, Ripley.

        Ripley spins on Burke, her tone accusing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You never said anything about an
                    android being here!  Why not?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's
                    been policy for years to have a
                    synthetic on board.

                                   BISHOP
                    I prefer the term 'artificial person'
                    myself.  Is there a problem?

                                   BURKE
                    A synthetic malfunctioned on her
                    last trip out.  Some deaths were
                    involved.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

                                   BURKE
                    Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.

        Bishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory.

                                   BISHOP
                    Well, that explains it.  The
                    A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
                    That could never happen now with
                    out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible
                    for me to harm or, by omission of
                    action, allow to be harmed a
                    human being.
                           (smiling)
                    More cornbread?

        WHAM!  Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway
        across the room.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Just stay away from me, Bishop!
                    You got that straight?

        Burke and Gorman exchange glances.

        Wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back
        to the other troopers.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    She don't like the cornbread
                    either.

        INT. READY ROOM - TIGHT ON APONE - ARMORY                33

        bellowing.

                                   APONE
                    Tench-hut!

        WIDER ANGLE  as the troops snap to from their lounging
        among the racks of high-tech weaponry.  Gorman enters
        with Burke and Ripley.

                                   GORMAN
                    At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't
                    have time to brief before we
                    left Gateway but...

                                   HUDSON
                    Sir?

                                   GORMAN
                           (annoyed)
                    Yes, Hicks?

                                   HUDSON
                    Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

                                   GORMAN
                    What's the question?

                                   HUDSON
                    Is this going to be a stand-up
                    fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

                                   GORMAN
                    All we know is that there's
                    still no contact with the colony
                    and that a xenomorph may be
                    involved.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    A what?

                                   HICKS
                           (to Wierzbowski;
                           low)
                    It's a bug-hunt.
                           (louder)
                    So what are these things?

        Gorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops.
        She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I've dictated what I know on
                    these.

                                   APONE
                    Tease us a bit.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Yeah...previews.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Okay.  It's important to understand
                    this organism's life cycle.  It's
                    actually two creatures.  The first
                    form hatches from a spore...a sort
                    of large egg, and attaches itself
                    to its victim.  Then it injects
                    an embryo, detaches and dies.
                    It's essentially a walking sex organ.
                    The --

                                   HUDSON
                    Sounds like you, Hicks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (controlled)
                    The embryo, the second form, hosts
                    in the victim's body for several
                    hours.  Gestating.  Then it...
                           (with difficulty)
                    ...then it...emerges.  Moults.
                    Grows rapidly --

                                   VASQUEZ
                    I only need to know one thing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yes?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Where they are.

        Vasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and
        blows away an imaginary alien.

                                   DRAKE
                    Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   HUDSON
                    Somebody said alien...she
                    thought they said illegal alien
                    and signed up.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Fuck you.

                                   HUDSON
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (icy)
                    Am I disturbing you conversation
                    Mr. Hudson?

        Hudson settles down, smirking.  Ripley locks eyes with
        Vasquez.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I hope you're right.  I really
                    do.

                                   BURKE
                           (to all)
                    I suggest you study the disks
                    Ripley has been kind enough to
                    prepare for you.

                                   GORMAN
                    Are there any questions?  Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    How do I get out of this
                    chicken-shit outfit?

        Gorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes
        over the predrop briefing.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right.  I want this to go
                    smooth and by the numbers.  I
                    want DCS and tactical database
                    assimilation by 0830.
                            (some groans)

                    drop-ship prep details will have

        sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing
        CLANG.  PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is
        lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.

        Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
        ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
        it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his
        hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
        move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
        in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
        crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open
        ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
        by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
        with the driver's movements.

        You have never seen anything like this before.
        Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
        to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease.
        Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled
        "CATERPILLAR."

        Spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship
        and we become aware of the intense activity throughout
        the cavernous loading bay.  Troopers on foot or driving
        TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion.
        Hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 37

        Wierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping
        light weapons with precise movements.  Around them,
        in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal
        artillery.

        Vasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the
        authority.  Her hands move without hesitation.  CLACK.
        CLACK.  CLACK.  She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out
        on a work stand.  Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED
        SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted
        automatic weapon.  The futuristic equivalent of a .30
        caliber light machine gun.  Sort of a steadicam that
        kills.

        INT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN             38

        with pre-flight activity b.g.

                                   BURKE
                    Still nothing from the colony?

                                   GORMAN
                    Dead on all channels.

        Ripley watches the drop-ship being loaded.  A cross
        between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle
        might describe it.  An orbit-to-surface troop carrier,
        heavily armed for the close support of ground missions.
        She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's
        belly.  Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of
        incomprehensible equipment toward her.

                                   FROST
                    Clear, please.

        Ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically.  She turns.
        Steps hastily back.  Hudson cruises by with a laden
        forklift.

                                   HUDSON
                    Excuse me.

        ANGLE ON APONE  standing with Hicks, as Ripley approaches
        him

                                   RIPLEY
                    I feel like a fifth wheel
                    here.  Is there anything I can
                    do?

                                   APONE
                    I don't know.  Is there anything
                    you can do?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (pointing)
                    I can drive that loader.  I've
                    got a Class Two rating.  My
                    latest career move.

        Apone turns.  A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in
        an equipment bay.

        TWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS  skeptical.  Considering.

        TIGHT ON POWER SWITCH  as Ripley's finger punches it on.
        A RISING WHINE of power.

        TIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS  as the massive machine stirs
        to life.

        FULL, as the loader starts.  Ripley is strapped into
        the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the
        servo-sensor assemblies.  She takes a step.  BOOM!
        Two tons of hardened steel takes a step.

        Ripley spins the wrist servos.  The huge claws swing,
        open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a
        cargo module, nearby.  She raises it deftly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Where you want it?

        Hicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 39

        The troopers are suiting up for the drop.  Strapping on
        their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like
        football padding.  They tape their wrists.  Draw on
        segmented boots.  The sole cleats CLACK like hooves
        on the deck plates.  Lockers SLAM.

        WEB BELTS.  PACKS.  HARNESSES.  HELMETS.  COM-SETS.
        Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings.
        It has its own rhythm...CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.

                                   APONE
                    Let's move it, girls!  On
                    the ready line.  Let's go,
                    let's go.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40

        Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into
        the ship with the hulking troopers.  Inside they pass
        directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take
        seats facing each other across a narrow aisle.  They will
        drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for
        rapid deployment.  A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling
        depressurization of the cargo lock.

        Hudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and
        exaggerated.  Ripley watches him working his way toward
        her.

                                   HUDSON
                    I am ready, man.  Ready to get
                    it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the
                    ultimate badass...state of the
                    badass art.  You do not want to
                    fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't
                    worry.  Me and my squad of
                    ultimate badasses will protect you.
                    Check-it-out...

        He slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY
        above them.

                                   HUDSON
                    Independently targetting
                    particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!
                    Fry half a city with this puppy.
                    We got tactical smart-missles,
                    phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
                    RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic
                    ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
                    got knives...sharp sticks --

        Hicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him
        into a seat.  His voice is low, but it carries.

                                   HICKS
                    Save it.

                                   HUDSON
                    Sure, Hicks.

        Ripley nods her thanks to Hicks.  MOTORS WHINE and the
        craft lurches.  Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly
        like this is a sport fishing trip.

                                   BURKE
                    Here we go.

        She looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the
        pellet to drop.

        EXT. SULACO                                              41

        The drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive
        launch rig.  The night side of Acheron yawns below...
        enigmatic.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             42

        Ferro and Spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches.

                                   FERRO
                    Initiate release sequencer on my

        EXT. SULACO - DROP-SHIP                                  43

        Hydraulic WHINE.  Clamps SLAM BACK.  The ship drops.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     44

        Apone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold.
        Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees.
        Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           45

        It screams down through the stratosphere, plunging
        into dark turbulence.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             46

        Beyond the canopy is gray limbo.  The craft shudders
        and lurches.

                                   FERRO
                           (icy calm)
                    Switching to DCS ranging.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.
                    Picking up some hull ionization.

                                   FERRO
                    Got it.  Rough air ahead.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          47

        TIGHT ON HICKS  asleep in his harness.

                                   FERRO
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Stand by for some chop.

        TIGHT ON GORMAN  as the ship begins to buck, his eyes
        closed.  Pale.  Sweating.  He rubs his hands on his
        knees repeatedly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How may drops is this for you,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                    Thirty-eight...simulated.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    How many combat drops?

                                   GORMAN
                    Well...two.  Three, including
                    this one.

        Vasquez and Drake exchange do-you-believe-this-shit
        expressions.  Ripley looks accusingly at Burke.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             48

                                   FERRO
                    Turning on final.  Coming around to
                    a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal
                    guidance locked in.  Where's
                    the damn beacon?

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           49

        It emerges from the low cloud ceiling.  From the twilight
        haze ahead the distant colony LANDING BEACONS become
        visible.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          50

        Stumbling as the ship pitches, Ripley makes her way
        forward to the MOBILE TACTICAL OPERATIONS BAY (MTOB),
        a control console lined with monitor screens.  She
        joins Burke watching over Gorman's shoulder as the
        Lieutenant plays the board like a video director.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR CONSOLE  REVEALING screens labelled with
        the names of the troopers.  Two for each soldier.  The
        upper screens show images from the IMAGE-INTENSIFIED
        VIDEO CAMERAS in their helmets.  The lower screens are
        BIO-MONITORS:  EEG, EKG, and other graphic life-function
        readouts.  Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.

                                   GORMAN
                    Let's see.  Everybody on line.
                    Drake, check you camera.  There
                    seems to be a...

        CLOSE ON DRAKE  as he whacks himself on the head with
        an ammo case.  A familiar malfunction.

                                   GORMAN
                           (o.s)
                    ...that's better.  Pan it around
                    a bit.

                                   APONE
                    Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.
                    Let's move.  Two minutes.
                    Somebody wake up Hicks.

        A clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons.
        Vasquez and Drake buckle on their smart-gun body
        harnesses.

        Ripley watches the AP station loom on the exterior
        screens.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That the atmosphere processor?

                                   BURKE
                    Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,
                    all over the planet.  They're
                    completely automated.  We
                    manufacture them, by the way.

        EXT. SHIP - AP STATION                                   51

        The tiny ship circles the roaring tower.  A metal
        volcano thundering like the engines on God's Lear jet.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          52

        Gorman plays with the controls, zooming the image of
        the colony.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Hold at forty.  Slow circle of
                    the complex.

                                   RIPLEY                                   
                    The structure seems intact.  They
                    have power.

        On the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low
        visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Apone)
                    Okay, let's do it.

                                   APONE
                    Awright!  I want a nice clean
                    dispersal this time.

        Ripley turns as Vasquez squeezes past her.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You staying in here?

                                   RIPLEY
                    You bet.

                                   VASQUEZ
                           (turning away)
                    Figures.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Set down sixty meters this side
                    of the telemetry mast.  Immediate
                    dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
                    on station.

                                   APONE
                    Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      53

        Landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac.
        The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp.  Slams
        down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS.  The APC hits the ground
        a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps
        up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling.

        The APC pulls to the edge of the complex.  The CREW DOOR
        opens.  Troopers hit the ground running.  Spread out.
        They drop behind immediate cover.  Apone scans with
        him image intensifier visor lowered.

        APONE'S P.O.V.  through the starlight-scope visor.
        Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we
        SEE the colony buildings.  Trash blows in the street.
        No other movement.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    First squad up, on line.  Hicks,
                    get yours in a cordon.  Watch the
                    rear.

                                   APONE
                    Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

        Sprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on
        the colony main entry-lock.  Parked tightly across the
        doors are two heavy-duty tractors.  Vasquez reaches one
        of the tractors, looks inside.  The controls are ripped
        out, as if by a crowbar or axe.  She moves on.

        EXT. COLONY BUILDING                                     54

        Vasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the
        right.  Apone tries the door controls.  Nothing.

                                   APONE
                    Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.

        Hudson, all business now, moves up and studies the
        door control panel.  He pries off the facing and starts
        clipping on the bypass wires.

                                   APONE
                    First squad, assemble on me at
                    the main lock.

        The wind roars around the bleak structures.  A neon sign
        creaks overhead.  Hudson makes a connection.  The door
        shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside.  It jams
        partway open.  Apone motions Vasquez inside.  She
        eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors.
        The others follow.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Second team, move up.
                    Flanking positions.

        INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE                             55

        DOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as
        they move into the broad corridor.  A few emergency
        lights are still on.  Wind moans along the concourse.
        Pools of water cover the floor.  Farther down, rain drips
        through blast holes in the ceiling.  Evidence of a
        fire fight with pulse-rifles.

        ON VASQUEZ  moving forward.  Taut.  Alert.  Her smart-gun
        cannon swinging slowly in an arc.  She studies the
        video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead.
        Their footsteps echo.

        INT. APC                                                 56

        Ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty
        colony building.

                                   GORMAN
                    Quarter and search by twos.  Second
                    team move inside.  Hicks, take the
                    upper level.  Use your motion
                    trackers.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL                       57

        Hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level.
        They emerge cautiously.  An empty corridor recedes into
        the dim distance.  Hicks unslings a rugged piece of
        equipment.  Aims it down the hall.  He adjusts the
        "gain."  It remains silent.

                                   HICKS
                    Nothing.  No movement.

        They pass rooms and offices.  Through doors they see
        increasing signs of struggle.  Furniture overturned.
        Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles.

        INT. APC                                                 58

        Ripley et al watching.

                                   BURKE
                    Looks like my room in college.

        Nobody laughs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                        59

        Hicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms.  There are
        no bodies.  In several offices the exterior windows are
        blown out, admitting wind and rain.  Hicks picks up a
        half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with
        rainwater.

        INT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS                              60

        Apone's men are searching systematically in pairs.  They
        pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little
        more than cubicles.  Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez
        as they move forward.  Hudson touches a splash of color
        on the wall.  Dried blood.  His tracker BEEPS.

        Vasquez whirls, cannon aimed.  The BEEPING grows more
        frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door.  The
        door is splintered partway out of its frame.  Holes
        caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls.  Vasquez
        eases up to the door.  Kicks it in.  Tenses to fire.

        Inside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a
        junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a
        broken window.  It clanks against the rails of a child's
        bunkbed as it swings.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     61

        Ripley watches Hicks' monitor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Wait!  Tell him to...
                           (plugs in
                           headset jack)
                    ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left.
                    There!

        TIGHT ON MONITOR  as the image shifts, revealing a
        section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular
        pattern.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  knowing what it is.

                                   HICKS

                   You seeing this okay?  Looks
                   melted.

        Burke raises an eyebrow at Ripley.

                                   BURKE
                    Hmm.  Acid for blood.

                    Looks like somebody bagged them
                    one of Ripley's bad guys here.

        INT. FIRST LEVEL                                         62

        Hudson is looking at something.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
                    love this...

        WIDER ANGLE  showing the trooper standing beneath a
        gaping hole.  Another hole, directly beneath, is at his
        feet.  The acid has melted right down through two levels
        into the maintenance level.  Revealing pipes, conduit,
        equipment...eaten away by the ferocious substance.

                                   APONE
                    Second squad?  What's your status?

        Gorman turns to the others.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right, the area's secured.
                    Let's go in and see what their

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      65

        Lights arc across the dormant buildings as the APC turns
        onto the "main drag."  It trundles down the rutted
        street, throwing up sheets of filthy water as the
        massive wheels hit pondlike potholes.  Windblown rain
        lashes across the headlights.

        Hicks emerges from the south lock just as the APC rolls
        up close to the entrance.  The crew-door slides back.
        Gorman emerges, followed by Burke, Bishop, and
        Wierzbowski.  Burke looks back to see Ripley stop in the
        APC doorway, eyeing the ominous colony structure.  She
        meets his eyes.  Shakes her head "no."  Not ready.

                                   HUDSON
                           (voice over;

                    Okay, stand by in operations.
                           (to those present)
                    Let's go.

        INT. APC                                                 66

        The crew-door cycles home with a clang.  Ripley sits in
        the dark interior, lit by the tactical displays.  The
        wind howls outside, an incredibly desolate sound.  She
        hugs herself.  Alone.  Unarmed.  She knows she's in a
        tank, but remembers the acid.  Leaps up.  Hits the door
        switch.

        EXT. APC - SOUTH LOCK                                    67

        The crew-door opens and Ripley emerges.  In time to see
        the lock doors rumbling closed.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    Burke!

        The wind snatches her words away.  The crew door whines
        shut behind her.  She walks to the exterior lock
        door-controls and studies them.  She punches some
        unfamiliar buttons.  Nothing happens.  She looks really
        nervous, alone in the howling wind.  She hits another
        button.  The door-motors come to life and she relaxes
        a little.  Glances behind her.  AND SCREAMS!  There's
        a face right there!  Right at her shoulder.  She jumps
        back, gasping for breath.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Scare you?

                                   RIPLEY
                    Christ, Wierzbowski!

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an
                    eye on you.

        He gestures for her to precede him inside.

        INT. CONTROL BLOCK CORRIDOR                              68

        Ripley catches up with the others as they move into the
        bowels of the complex.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Burke)
                    Looks like you company can write
                    off its share of this colony.

                                   BURKE
                           (unconcerned)
                    It's insured.

        ON RIPLEY  as they move along the corridor...reacting to
        the fact that she is back in alien country.  She sees
        the ravaged administration complex.  Fire-gutted offices.
        Hicks notices her looking around nervously.  He motions
        to big Wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually
        falls in beside her on the other side, rifle at ready.
        a two-man protective cordon.  She glances at Hicks.  He
        winks, but so fast maybe it's something in his eye.

        Trooper Frost emerges from a side corridor ahead.

                                   FRONT
                    Sir, you should check this out...

        He leads the way into the corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            69

        This wing is completely without power.  The troopers
        switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate
        a scene of devastation worse than they have seen.  Her
        expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee.

                                   FROST
                    Right ahead here...

        They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a
        hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door
        panels.  Acid holes have slashed through the floor and
        walls in several places.  The metal is scratched and
        twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like
        a soup can on one side.  They squeeze through the
        opening.

        INT. MEDICAL WING                                        70

        They pack-lights play over the devastation of the
        colonists' last ditch battle.  The equipment of the med
        labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier.  The walls
        are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid.  Scorched
        by untended fires to bare metal.  A few instruments glow
        with emergency power.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Last stand.

                                   GORMAN
                    No bodies?

                                   FROST
                    No, Sir.  Looks like it was a
                    helluva fight.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  transfixed by something.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Over there.

        The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees.  She
        has entered a second room, part of the med lab area.  In
        a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
        transparent cylinders.  STASIS TUBES.  They glow faintly
        with an eerie violet light given off by the field which
        preserves the specimens inside.

        They look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS,
        the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus.
        Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
        translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like
        organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid.
        Something you definitely do not want on your face, for
        example.

                                   BURKE
                    Are these the same...?

        Ripley nods, unable to speak.  Burke leans closer in
        fascination.  His face almost touching one cylinder, is
        lit by its glow.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Watch it, Burke...

        The creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against
        the glass.  Burke jumps back.  From the palm of the
        thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE.
        like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers
        tonguelike over the inside of the glass.  Then it
        retracts into a sheath between the "gills."

                                   HICKS
                           (to Burke)
                    It likes you.

        Only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life.
        Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the
        hand-things remain inertly clenched.

                                   BURKE
                    These are dead.  There's just
                    the two alive.

        On top of each cylinder is a file folder.  Ripley takes
        a folder from above one of the live specimens.  Inside
        is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.

                                   RIPLEY

        They are startled by a LOUD BEEP.  They turn.  Hicks
        is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the
        shattered barricade.  BEEP.  BEEP.

                                   HICKS
                    Behind us.

        He gestures at the corridor they just passed through.

                                   RIPLEY
                    One of us?

                                   GORMAN
                           (into headset)
                    Apone...where are your people?
                    Anybody in D-Block?

                                   APONE
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Negative.  We're all in Operations.

        Vasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on
        its support arm, locking it with an authoritative
        CLICK.  She and Hicks head toward the source of the
        signal, the others following.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            71

        Hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly.  They
        turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth.

        Ripley hangs back.  Then realizes there is nothing
        behind her but darkness.  She catches up to the group.

        INT. KITCHENS                                            72

        The troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the
        stainless steel surfaces.

                                   HICKS
                    It's moving.

        Vasquez is scanning, gaze intense.  The other troops
        grip their weapons tightly.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Which way?

        Hicks nods toward a complicated array of food
        processing equipment.  They move forward, weapons
        leveled.

        Ripley shuffles forward in the dark.  Wierzbowski
        trips over a metal cannister, sending it CLANGING.
        Ripley half climbs the wall.

        Hicks' tracker beeps steadily.  The beeps merge.
        Become a solid tone.  CRASH.  Something moves in the
        dark, toppling a rack of stockpots.

        ON VASQUEZ  pivoting smoothly to fire.  In the same
        instant Hicks' rifle slashes INTO FRAME.  Slams
        Vasquez' barrel upward.  A STREAM OF TRACER FIRE rips
        into the ceiling, the rounds SEARING LIKE LIGHTNING.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You fuck!

        Hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light
        under a row of steel cabinets.  He gestures to Ripley,
        who steps forward.  Trusting his judgment.  She
        crouches beside him.

        RIPLEY'S P.O.V.  lit by Hicks' pack-light...a tiny
        cowering figure.  A very dirty, very terrified
        NEWT JORDEN.  She clutches a plastic food packet in
        one hand, its top gnawed partway through.  In the other
        hand she grips the HEAD OF A LARGE DOLL, holding it by
        the hair.  Just the head.  Eyes staring.  Newt is
        pathetically emaciated...fragile-looking as Dresden
        china, her hair tangled and matted.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothingly)
                    Come on out.  It's all right...

        Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the
        cabinet.  Newt backs away, trembling visibly, her
        vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights.
        Ripley's hand almost reaches her.

        The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the
        cabinetry.  Ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her
        in sight.  Crabbing frantically sideways.  Hicks makes
        a grab, catching one tiny ankle.  He snaps his hand
        out a moment later.

                                   HICKS
                    Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.

        The girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
        baseboard, its grille kicked out.  She scrambles
        inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like
        a fish.

        In his bulky armor Hicks knows he'll never make it
        into the tiny duct.  Ripley dives.  She squirms into
        the duct without thinking.  Just ahead she sees Newt
        enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch.  Ripley
        pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it,
        and crawls in after her.

        Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel
        chamber.  Ripley shines her light around in amazement.
        It is a NEST.  A nest built by a child.  Wadded up
        blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a
        haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP
        JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a
        battery operated TAPE PLAYER.  All foraged from the
        wrecked colony.  Ripley marvels at the child's
        incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even
        in this nightmarish environment.

        Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch.

        Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug.  The
        kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets.  Eyes
        wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent.  No
        scream.

                                   RIPLEY
                    It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...
                    you're going to be all right now...
                    it's okay...you're safe...

        Newt goes limp, almost catatonic.

        CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE  her lips
        are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and
        she flinches from unseen terrors.  We READ a dark
        nightmare world in her eyes.

        Ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris...
        a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling,
        a ribbon in her hair.  In embossed gold letters
        underneath it says:

                      FIRST GRADE CITIZENSHIP AWARD
                              REBECCA JORDEN

        INT. OPERATIONS - ON NEWT - MANAGER'S OFFICE             73

        sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees.
        Looking at a point in space.

        WIDER ANGLE  REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of her
        while Dietrich watches the readouts from a
        BIO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.

                                   GORMAN
                    Now think, Rebecca.
                    Concentrate.  Just start at
                    the beginning...

        No response.  Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.

                                   GORMAN
                    Where are your parents?  You
                    have to try...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (sharply)
                    Gorman!  Give it a rest would
                    you.

        Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.

                                   GORMAN
                    Total brain-lock.

                                   DIETRICH
                           (shrugs)
                    Physically she's okay.
                    Borderline malnutrition, but
                    I don't think any permanent
                    damage.

        She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.

                                   GORMAN
                    Come on, we're wasting our
                    time.

        Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley with
        Newt.  Through the window of the office, out on the
        main floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorman
        join Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal.

        Ripley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkempt
        hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Here, try this.  A little
                    instant hot chocolate.

        She wraps the child's hands around the cup.  Raises
        it to her lips for her.  The girl drinks mechanically,
        spilling down her chin.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothing)
                    Poor thing.  You don't talk
                    much do you?  That's okay by
                    me.  Most people do a lot of
                    talking and they wind up not
                    saying very much.

        She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Uh oh.  I made a clean spot
                    here.  Now I've done it.  Guess
                    I'll just have to do the whole
                    thing.

        She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small
        cloth and gently washes the little girl's face.
        Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Hard to believe...there's a
                    little girl under all this.
                    And a pretty one at that.

        Newt gazes at her.  Ripley smiles.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                          74

        The ground teams are gathered around a terminal in
        the computer center.  Hudson has the CPU main computer
        on-line and reading out.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN  as an abstract of the main

        INT. OFFICE                                              75

        Ripley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth,
        pink skin emerging from black grime.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I don't know how you managed
                    to stay alive but you're one
                    brave kid, Rebecca.

        Newt's voice is almost inaudible.

                                   NEWT
                    N-newt.

        Ripley leans closer.  Feels like she's breathing
        on coals.  The sound was incomprehensible.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What did you say?

                                   NEWT
                    Newt.  My n-name's Newt.
                    Nobody calls me Rebecca except
                    my dork brother.

        Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak...
        or break the spell.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, Newt it is then.  My
                   name's Ripley...and people
                   call me Ripley.

        Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it
        formally.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Pleased to meet you.  And who
                   is this?  Does she have a
                   name?

        Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched
        in one filthy hand.

                                  NEWT
                   Casey.  She's my only friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about me?

        Newt's reply is flat, neutral.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want you for a friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

                                  NEWT 
                   Because you'll be gone soon,
                   like the others.  Like
                   everybody.  You'll be dead
                   and you'll leave me alone.

        Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous
        statement and by the situation which could have
        produced this outlook in a child.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad
                   went away like that, didn't
                   they?
        
        Newt nods, staring at her knees.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (soothingly)
                   They'd be here if they could,
                   honey.  I know they would.

                                  NEWT
                          (with cold certainty)
                   They're dead.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I
                   won't leave you.  I promise.

                                  NEWT
                   You promise?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Cross my heart.

                                  NEWT
                   And hope to die?

        Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre
        expression.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   And hope to die.

        And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even
        the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished
        by a smile and a single promise.

        Newt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley.  Her lower
        lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms
        into an abject mask.  She sobs as she clamps her arms
        around Ripley's neck.  The sobs come in waves as
        Ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and
        grief and hurt rolling down her face.  It is a
        breakthrough.

        Ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise
        can be kept.

        EXT. ACHERON - TWILIGHT                                  77

        The APC roars across the stygian landscape, traversing
        the causeway which connects the colony to the
        ATMOSPHERE STATION a kilometer away.  Behind it the
        drop-ship settles to the ground at the colony landing
        field.

        PAN WITH THE APC TO REVEAL the massive structure.
        Like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower
        flickers with spectral light.

        INT. APC                                                 78

        The troopers sit, more subdued now, swaying and
        bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle.  Wierzbowski
        is in the saddle.  Ripley and Newt sit side by side
        just aft of the driver's cockpit.

                                  NEWT
                   I was the best at the game.
                   I knew the whole maze.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The 'maze'?  You mean the
                   air ducts?

                                  NEWT
                   Yeah, you know.  In the walls,
                   under the floor.  I was the
                   ace.  I could hide better
                   than anybody.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're really something, ace.

        Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as the
        processing station looms ahead.

        EXT. APC/STATION                                         79

        The vast structure towers above the parked personnel
        carrier.  Deploying in front of the APC, backlit by
        its lights, the troopers cast long shadows.  They
        look ominous.  Hulking techno-samurai.

        The base of the station is a depthless maze of
        conduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery.
        Or a Dantean version of one.  The THRUM of
        functioning machine systems echoes through the
        labyrinth.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Forty meters in.  Ramp on
                   axial two-two.  Access to
                   sublevels.

        The troopers start down the open rampway.  Light
        filters down through several levels of steel mesh
        floor, catwalks and pipes.  Below that is darkness.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   B-Level.  Next one down.

        The thrumming of machines grows louder as they
        descend.

        INT. APC                                                 80

        Huddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke and
        Gorman.  Newt squeezes in from behind.  Gorman is
        doing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.

                                  GORMAN
                          (to team)
                   We're not making that out too
                   well.  What is it?

                                  HUDSON
                          (voice over; static)
                   You tell me.  I only work
                   here.

        INT. COMPLEX                                             81

        The group stands before a bizarre tableau.  Among
        the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits
        something new and not of human design had been
        added.

        It is a structure of some sort, extending from and
        crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made
        of some strange encrusted substance.  It vaguely
        resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
        larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into
        the original hardware that it is hard to see where
        one ends and the other begins.

        The alien structure seems to extend far back into
        the complex of machinery.  The plant thrums loudly,
        its functioning seemingly not impaired.

        INT. APC                                                 82

        Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.

                                  GORMAN
                   What is it?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know.

                                  GORMAN
                          (to team)
                   Proceed inside.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     83

        They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their
        lights over the walls.  Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL
        LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone.  The air
        is thick with STEAM.  Trickling water.  The place
        seems almost alive.

        INT. APC                                                 84

        They watch in various helmet-camera P.O.V.'s of the
        wall detail.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (low)
                   Oh God...
        
        CLOSE ON VIDEO  as it PAN SLOWLY...REVEALING a
        bas-relief of detritus from the colony:  furniture,
        wiring, human bones, skulls...Fused together with a
        translucent, epoxylike substance.

                                  DIETRICH
                          (voice over; static)
                   Looks like some sort of secreted
                   resin.

                                  GORMAN
                   They ripped apart the colony
                   for building materials.

                                  RIPLEY
                   And the colonists...When they
                   were done with them.
                          (turning)
                   Newt, you better go sit up
                   front.  Go on.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     85

        Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper
        inside.

                                  FROST
                   Hotter'n hell in here.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah...but it's a dry
                   heat.

        INT. APC                                                 86

        Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic
        readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right under the
                   primary heat exchangers.

                                  BURKE
                   Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like
                   the heat, that's why they built...

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's not what I mean.  Gorman,
                   if your men have to use their
                   weapons in there, they'll rupture
                   the cooling system.

                                  BURKE
                          (realizing)
                   She's right.

                                  GORMAN
                   So.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So...then the fusion
                   containment shuts down.

                                  GORMAN
                          (impatient)
                   So?  So?

                                  BURKE
                   We're talking thermonuclear
                   explosion.

                                  GORMAN
                   Shit.
                          (into
                          mike)
                   Apone, collect magazines
                   from everybody.  We can't
                   have any firing in there.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     87

        The troopers look at each other in dismay.

                                  WIERZBOWSKI
                   Is he fucking crazy?

                                  HUDSON
                   What're we supposed to use,
                   man?  Harsh language?

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Flame-units only.  I want
                   rifles slung.

                                  APONE
                   Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

        He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines
        from each one's weapon.

        Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly.

        The three who are carrying them get out small
        incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez
        slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts
        it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs
        back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath
        attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an
        old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt
        stock.  Chambers a round.

                                  HICKS
                          (low,
                          to Hudson)
                   I always keep this handy.
                   For close encounter.

                                  APONE
                          (o.s.)
                   Let's move.  Hicks, back
                   us up.

        INT. LARGER CHAMBER                                      88

        The air is thick.  Lights flare.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          very faint)
                   Any movement?

        Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nothing.  Zip.

        Apone stops, his expression changing.  They face a
        wall of living horror.  The colonists have been
        brought here and entombed alive...

        COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices
        of the structure.  The cocoon material is the same
        translucent epoxy.  The bodies are frozen in
        carelessly twisted positions.  Macabre image of
        frozen agony.  Many are disiccated.  Skeletal.
        Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within.
        Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death
        as hosts for the embryos growing within then.

        Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures,
        perhaps the most "recent."  A WOMAN, ghost-white
        and drained.  The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They
        seem to plead.

                                  DIETRICH
                   Sir!

        The woman's lips move feebly.

                                  WOMAN
                   Please...God...kill me.

        INT. APC                                                 89

        Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled.  The
        sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      90

        The woman begins to convulse.  She SCREAMS, a
        sawing shriek of mindless agony.

                                  APONE
                   Flame thrower!  Move!

        Frost hands it to him.  Suddenly, the woman's chest
        EXPLODES in a gout of blood.  A SMALL FANGED HEAD
        EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY.

        Apone pulls the trigger.  Then the other troopers
        carrying flame throwers open fire.  An orgy of
        purging fire.  The cocoons vanish in the shimmering
        heat.

        A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from
        fingernails on blackboards.

        ANGLE ON WALL  as something begins to emerge.  Dimly
        glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger
        then a man.  Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly
        with the convoluted surface of fused bone.  The
        troopers don't see it.  Smoke from the burning cocoons
        quickly fills the confined space.  Visibility drops
        to zero.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!

                          (with an edge)
                   Talk to me, Hudson.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, seems to be in front
                   and behind.

        INT. APC                                                 91

        Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the
        monitors.

                                  GORMAN
                   We can't see anything back
                   here, Apone.  What's going on?

        Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night.  Dark,
        terrifying and inevitable.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (low)
                   Pull you team out, Gorman.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER - TIGHT ON SEVERAL WALLS AND         92
        CEILING NICHES

        as they come alive.  Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift,
        becoming emerging ALIENS.  Dimly glimpsed...glints
        of slime.  Silhouettes.

                                  APONE
                   Go to infrared.  Looks sharp
                   people!

        The squad members snap down their image-intersifier
        visors.

                                  HUDSON
                   Multiple signals.  All round.
                   Closing.

        Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held
        tightly.  A nightmarish silhouette materializes out
        of the smoke behind her!  It strikes like lightning.
        SEIZES HER.  She fires reflexively, wild.  The jet
        of flame engulfs Frost nearby.

        Apone spins as the double SCREAM.  Can't see anything
        in the think smoke.

        INT. APC                                                 93

        Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black.  His
        bio-readouts flatten.  The other screens show glimpses
        of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the
        images bobbing and panning confusedly.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      94

        Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Let's rock.

        They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke
        like welders' arcs.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Who's firing?  I ordered a
                   hold fire, dammit!

        Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the
        targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting
        dance.  Thunder and lightning.  Better than sex for
        her.  FLASH-CRACK!  An alien SCREECH from the darkness.

        INT. APC                                                 95

        The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens.
        Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the
        open frequency.  Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up.
        His life signs plummet.  Voices blend and overlap.

                                  HUDSON
                          (voice over)
                   Let's get the fuck out of
                   here!

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   Not that tunnel, the other
                   one!

                                  CROWE
                          (voice over)
                   You sure?  Watch it...behind
                   you.  Fucking move, will you!

        Gorman is ashen.  Confused.  Gulping for air like a
        grouper.  How could the situation have unravelled
        so fast?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Gorman)
                   GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO
                   IT NOW!

                                  GORMAN
                   Shut up.  Just shut up!

        CRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was
        pulled.  Flat line.

                                  GORMAN
                   Uh,...Apone, I want you to
                   lay down a suppressing fire
                   with the incinerators and
                   fall back by squads to the
                   APC, over.

                                  APONE
                          (voice over;
                          heavy static)
                   Say again?  All after
                   incinerators?

        Ripley watches it fall apart.

                                  GORMAN
                   I said...

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      96

        Apone adjusts his headset.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   ...lay down (garbled) ...by
                   squads to...(garbled)

        Gorman's voice breaks up completely.  A SCREAM.
        Apone whirls, uncertain.

                                  APONE
                   Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound
                   off!  Wierzbowski?

        Nothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head
        off.

                                  HUDSON
                          (freaked)
                   We're getting juked!  We're
                   gonna die in here!

        Apone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home,
        looking truly terrified.

                                  APONE
                   Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck
                   the heat exchanger!

        He FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a
        horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes
        sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically
        in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own
        private video game.

        She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She
        fires "at" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish
        figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by
        Vasquez' blast.

        INT. APC                                                 97

        Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.

                                  GORMAN
                          (distantly)
                   I told them to fall back...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (viciously)
                   They're but off!  Do something!

        But he's gone.  Total brain-lock.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision.
        She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to
        do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering
        past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the
        APC.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (in passing)
                   Newt, put your seatbelt on!

        Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes
        a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches.

                                  GORMAN
                   Ripley, what the hell...?

        She slams the tractor into gear.

        EXT. APC                                                 98

        as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground.  The
        massive machine leaps forward.

        INT. APC                                                 99

        Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead
        as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway.
        She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators
        viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot.
        Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning
        his command center.

                                  GORMAN
                          (shrill)
                   What are you doing?  Turn
                   around!  That's an order!

        He claws at her, hysterical.  Burke pulls him off.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100

        The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing
        away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits
        the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes
        on the flash of weapons fire ahead.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101

        The APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks,
        supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke.
        The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door
        open.

        Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as
        they fall back.

        Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his
        smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower.

        Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and
        drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees
        a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst,
        prone.  Clean body hit.

        The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing
        open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW
        ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating
        into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops
        in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame
        thrower.

        The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls,
        engulfing the back half of the APC.

        INT. APC                                                102

        Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots
        through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire.
        Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges,
        clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her
        inside.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Drake!  He's down!

        Hicks screams right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   He's gone!  Forget it, he's
                   gone!

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (irrational)
                   No.. No, he's not.  He's --

        Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Ripley)
                   Let's go!

        Ripley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC
        bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears
        under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks
        free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly
        CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against
        the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez
        the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE.
        Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.

                                  HICKS
                   Get on the Goddamn door!

        Gorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder
        against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
        his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening,
        its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN
        MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM!
        The creature is flung backward, its shattered head
        fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door,
        the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They
        slide the door home and dog it tight.

        EXT. APC                                                103

        The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams
        into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the
        shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's
        shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium.

        INT./EXT. APC                                           104-
                                                                105

        Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang.

        Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far
        from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his
        head turns.  The small hatch against which he was
        leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out
        the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek,
        legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling
        him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and
        buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder.
        Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE
        and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up
        as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon,
        a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc.
        VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's
        armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped
        unconscious, is dragged back inside.

        The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for
        clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet.
        Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews,
        broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office
        furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in
        the APC's wake.

        Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of
        Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening,
        hideous jaws lunge inside...

        Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same
        mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams
        both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge
        wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the
        headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars
        forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal
        body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls,
        tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine
        thunders onto the causeway and away from the station.

        A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
        from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand
        back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled.

                                  HICKS
                   It's okay...we're clear.  We're
                   clear.  Ease up.

        The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she
        slows the machine.

                                  HICKS
                   Sounds like a blown transaxle.
                   You're just grinding metal.

        EXT. APC                                                106

        The tractor limps to a halt.  A HALF-KILOMETER from the
        atmosphere processing station.  The APC is a smoking,
        acid-scarred mess.

        INT. APC                                                107

        Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins
        out of her seat into the aisle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt?  Where's Newt?

        Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt
        is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat
        and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified,
        but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You okay?

        Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes
        back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and
        staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all
        back in his mind.

                                  HUDSON
                   Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
                   it.

        Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.

                                  HUDSON
                          (jerking away)
                   I'm all right, leave it!

        Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checking
        for a pulse.

                                  HICKS
                   He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   He's fucking dead!

        She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly,
        ready to pulp him with her other fist.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (to Gorman)
                   Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill
                   you, you useless fuck!

        Hicks pushes her back.  Right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right
                   now.

        Vasquez releases Gorman.  His head smacks the deck.
        Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless
        purple puncture wound.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Looks like it stung him.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and
                   Dietrich aren't dead, man.

        They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing
        at the bio-function screens.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be like Gorman.  Their
                   signs are real low but they ain't
                   dead!

        Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around
        the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them
        as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just
        at the edges of their minds.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You can't help them.  Right now
                   they're being cocooned just like
                   the others.

                                  HUDSON
                          (sagging)
                   Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't
                   happening.

        Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes.  Ripley doesn't want
        it to be "I told you so" but Vasquez reads it that
        way.  She turns away with a snap.

        INT. MED LAB                                            108

        Bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a
        dissection of one of the dead parasites.  Spunkmeyer
        enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck
        and parks it near Bishop's work table.

                                  SPUNKMEYER
                   Need anything else?

        Bishop waves "no" without looking up.

        EXT. COLONY - DROP-SHIP                                 109

        Spunkmeyer emerges, crossing the Tarmac to the loading
        ramp of the ship.  As he nears the top of the ramp,
        his boot slips...skidding on something wet.  Kneeling,
        he touches a small puddle of thick slime.  He shrugs,
        and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close
        the doors.

        ON VASQUEZ  wired and intense.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   All right, we can't blow the fuck
                   out of them...why not roll some
                   canisters of CN-20 down there.
                   Nerve gas the whole nest?

                                  HUDSON
                   Look, man, let's just bug out and
                   call it even, okay?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   No good.  How do we know it'll
                   effect their biochemistry?  I say
                   we take off and nuke the entire
                   site from orbit.  It's the only
                   way to be sure.

                                  BURKE
                   Now hold on a second.  I'm not
                   authorizing that action.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

        Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals
        flawlessly into conciliatory mode.

                                  BURKE
                   Well, I mean...I know this is an
                   emotional moment, but let's not
                   make snap judgments.  Let's move
                   cautiously.  First, this physical
                   installation had a substantial
                   dollar value attached to it --

                                  RIPLEY
                   They can bill me.  I got a tab
                   running.  What's second?

                                  BURKE
                   This is clearly an important
                   species we're dealing with here.
                   We can't just arbitrarily
                   exterminate them --

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bullshit!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe you haven't been keeping up
                   on current events, but we just got
                   out asses kicked, pal!

        Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.

        Burke moves in, lowering his voice.  He takes her aside
        from the others.

                                  BURKE
                   I know, I know, but we're dealing
                   with changing scenarios here.  This
                   thing is major, Ripley.  I mean
                   really major.  You gotta go with
                   its energy.  Since you are the
                   representative of the company who
                   discovered this species your
                   percentage will naturally be
                   some serious, serious money.

        Ripley stares at his like he's a particularly
        disagreeable fungus.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You son of a bitch.

                                  BURKE
                          (hardening)
                   Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks
                   has authority here.

                                  BURKE
                   Corporal Hicks!?

                                  RIPLEY
                   This operation is under military
                   jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
                   chain of command.  Right?

                                  HICKS
                   Looks that way.

        Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.

                                  BURKE
                   Look, this is a multimillion
                   dollar operation.  He can't make
                   that kind of decision.  He's just
                   a grunt!
                          (glances at Hicks)
                   No offense.

                                  HICKS
                          (coolly)
                   None taken.
                          (into mike)
                   Ferro, you copying?

                                  FERRO
                          (voice over; static)
                   Standing by.

                                  HICKS
                   Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna
                   need an immediate evac.
                          (to Burke)
                   I think we'll take off and nuke
                   the site from orbit.  It's the
                   only way to be sure.

        He winks.  Burke looks like a kid whose toy has been
        snatched.

                                  BURKE
                   This is absurd!  You don't have
                   the authority to --

        CLACK!  The sound of a rifle bolt snapping home
        truncates his rant.  Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled,
        not exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed away
        either.  Her expression is masklike.  End of discussion.

        Ripley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.

                                  RIPLEY
                   We're going home, honey.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                          111

        The ship rises through the spray thrown up by the
        downblast of the VTOL jets, hovering above the complex
        like a huge insect, its searchlights blazing.

        EXT. APC                                                112

        The group is filing out of the personnel carrier, which
        is clearly a write off.  Hicks and Hudson have Gorman
        between them, and the others emerge into the wind.
        They watch the ship roar in on its final approach.

        INT. DROP-SHOP COCKPIT                                  113

        Ferro flicks the intercom switch several times.  Thumps
        her headset mike.

                                  FERRO
                   Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.

        The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.

                                  FERRO
                          (turning)
                   Where the fu --

        Her eyes widen.  It's not Spunkmeyer.

        Am impression of leering jaws which blur forward, then
        a whirl of motion and a truncated scream.  The throttle
        levers are slammed forward in the melee.

        EXT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATION                          114

        They watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
        VEERS WILDLY.  Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and the
        craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude.
        It skims the ground.  Clips a rock formation.  The
        ship slews, sideslipping.  It hits a ridge.  Tumbles,
        bursting into flame, breaking up.  It arcs into the
        air, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Run!

        She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
        section of the ship's massive engine module slams
        into the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage.

        The drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed in
        flames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION.  A TREMENDOUS
        FIREBALL.

        The remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
        of getting off the planet, and most of their superior
        fire power, reduced to flaming debris.

        There is a moment of stunned silence, then...

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Well that's great!  That's just
                   fucking great, man.  Now what the
                   fuck are we supposed to do, man?
                   We're in some real pretty shit now!

                                  HICKS
                   Are you finished?
                          (to Ripley)
                   You okay?

        She nods.  She can't disguise her stricken expression
        when she looks at Newt, but the little girl seems
        relatively calm.  She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.

                                  NEWT
                   I guess we're not leaving, right?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'm sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   You don't have to be sorry.  It
                   wasn't your fault.

                                  HUDSON
                          (kicking rocks)
                   Just tell me what the fuck we're
                   supposed to do now.  What're we
                   gonna do now?

                                  BURKE
                          (annoyed)
                   May be could build a fire and
                   sing songs.

                                  NEWT
                   We should get back, 'cause it'll
                   be dark soon.  They come mostly
                   at night.  Mostly.

        Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station looming
        in the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jammed
        into its basal structure.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGHT                              115

        The wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings,
        dry and cold.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         116

        The weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
        stock of their grim options.  Vasquez and Hudson are
        just setting down a scorched and dented packing case,
        one of several culled from the APC wreckage.

        Hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons,
        lying on a table.

                                  HICKS
                   This is all we could salvage.  We've
                   got four pulse-rifles with about
                   fifty rounds each.  Not so good.
                   About fifteen M-40 grenades and
                   two flame throwers less than
                   half full...one damaged.  And
                   We've got four of these
                   robot-sentry units with scanners
                   and display intact.

        He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a
        high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical
        sensing equipment, packed in foam.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long after we're declared
                   overdue can we expect a rescue?

                                  HICKS
                   About seventeen days.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, we're not going to make it
                   seventeen hours!  Those things
                   are going to come in here, just
                   like they did before, man...
                   they're going to come in here
                   and get us, man, long before...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She survived longer than that
                   with no weapons and no training.

        Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So you better just start dealing
                   with it.  Just deal with it,
                   Hudson...because we need you and
                   I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now
                   get on a terminal and call up some
                   kind of floor plan file.
                   Construction blueprints,
                   maintenance schematics, anything
                   that shows the layout of this
                   place.  I want to see air ducts,
                   electrical access tunnels,
                   subbasements.  Every possible way
                   into this wing.

        Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction.
        Hicks nods approval of her handling of it.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'll be in medical.  I'd like to
                   continue my analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Fine.  You do that.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         117

        Burke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large
        HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table.
        Newt hops from one foot to the other to see.

                                  RIPLEY
                   This service tunnel is how they're
                   moving back and forth.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah, right, it runs from the
                   processing station right into
                   the sublevel here.

        He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  There's a fire door
                   at this end.  The first thing we
                   do is put a remote sentry in the
                   tunnel and seal that door.

                                  HICKS
                   We gotta figure on them getting
                   into the complex.

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.  So we put up
                   welded barricades at these
                   intersections...
                          (pointing)
                   ...and seal these ducts here
                   and here.  Then they can only
                   come at us from these two
                   corridors and we create a free
                   field of fire for the other
                   two sentry units, here.

        Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand,
        satisfied.

                                  HICKS
                   Outstanding.  Then all we need's
                   a deck of cards.  All right, let's
                   move like we got a purpose.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.

                                  NEWT

                   Aye-firmative!

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL                          118

        A long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit,
        seems to go on forever.  Vasquez and Hudson have
        finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
        tripods in the tunnel.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   Testing!

        She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the
        automatic field of fire.  The sentry guns swivel
        smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled
        by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into
        dime-sized shrapnel.  They retreat behind a heavy steel
        FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track.  Vasquez,
        using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door
        to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hudson here.  A and B
                   sentries are in place and
                   keyed.  We're sealing the
                   tunnel.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDOR                              119

        Hicks pauses in his work.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.

        He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening with
        a metal plate, welding it in place, showering sparks
        in the dark corridor.  Behind them Burke and Newt
        are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a
        hand truck, stacking it inside the operations center.
        Hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object
        out of a belt pouch.  A braceletlike EMERGENCY
        LOCATING BEEPER.

                                  HICKS
                   Here, put this on.  Then
                   I can locate you anywhere
                   in the complex on this --

        He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battle
        harness.  He shrugs, a little self-consciously.

                                  HICKS
                   Just a...precaution.  You
                   know.

        Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding him
        quizzically.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (strapping
                          it on)
                   Thanks.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, what's next?

        She consults a printout of the floor plan.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK                                      120

        The wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie
        stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud
        the complex.  Visibility is low in the fog.
        Everything looks underwater.  There is no movement.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           121

        In the barricaded corridor sentry-gun "C" sits waiting,
        its "ARMED" light flashing green.  Through a hole
        torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor
        the fog swirls in.  Water drips.  An expectant hush.

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROOM                     122

        Ripley carries an exhausted Newt through the inner
        connecting rooms of the medical wing.  She reaches
        an OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tech
        ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment.
        Several metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R.
        equipment which is pushed into one corner.

        Newt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barely
        awake...out of steam.  Ripley sets her on one of
        the cots and Newt lies down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now you just lie here and
                   have a nap.  You're exhausted.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want to...I have
                   scary dreams.

        This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but she
        feigns cheerfulness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll bet Casey doesn't have
                   bad dreams.

        Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny fingers
        and looks inside.  It is, of course, empty.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Nothing bad in here.  Maybe
                   you could just try to be like
                   her.

        Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
        Newt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull that
        five-year-old shit on me, lady.  I'm six."

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley...she doesn't have
                   bad dreams because she's just
                   a piece of plastic.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   My mommy always said there
                   were no monsters.  No real
                   ones.  But there are.

        Ripley's expression becomes sober.  She brushes damp
        hair back from the child's pale forehead.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Yes, there are, aren't there.

                                  NEWT
                   Why do they tell little kids
                   that?

        Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal.
        She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying
        as her most primal child's nightmare if not more
        so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is
        no Santa.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, some kids can't handle
                   it like you can.

                                  NEWT
                   Did one of those things grow
                   inside her?

        Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
        around her tiny body.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, Newt.  That's
                   the truth.

                                  NEWT
                   Isn't that how babies come?
                   I mean people babies...they
                   grow inside you?

                                  RIPLEY
                   No, it's different, honey.

                                  NEWT
                   Did you ever have a baby?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes.  A little girl.

                                  NEWT
                   Where is she?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Gone.

                                  NEWT
                   You mean dead.

        It's more statement than question.  Ripley nods slowly.

        She turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER
        sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed.  She
        switches it on.  It HUMS and emits a cozy orange
        glow.

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley, I was just thinking...
                   Maybe I could do you a favor and
                   fill in for her.  Just for a
                   while.  You can try it and if
                   you don't like it, it's okay.
                   I'll understand.  No big deal.
                   Whattya think?

        Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering...
        a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
        in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
        may see another dawn.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I think it's not the worst idea
                   I've heard all day.  Let's talk
                   about it later.

        She switches off the light and starts to rise.  Newt
        grabs her arm.  A plaintive voice in the dark.

                                  NEWT
                   Don't go!  Please.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll be right in the other
                   room, Newt.  And look...I can
                   see you on that camera right
                   up there.

        Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door.
        Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by
        Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it
        down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.  Take is for luck.  Now
                   go to sleep...and don't dream.

        Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging
        Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
        light on the bracelet.  The space heater hums
        comfortingly.

        INT. MED LAB                                            123

        ECU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of a
        corpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically.  The
        only sign of life.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   How is he?

        Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying
        motionless on an examining table.  Bishop looks up
        from his instruments nearby, the light of a single
        gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.

                                  BISHOP
                   I've isolated a neuro-muscular
                   toxin responsible for the
                   paralysis.  It seems to be
                   metabolizing.  He should wake
                   up soon.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now let me get this straight.
                   The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
                   carried them over there,
                   cocooned them to be hosts for
                   more of those...

        Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
        face-hugger specimens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Which would mean lots of
                   those parasites, right?  One
                   for each person...over a hundred
                   at least.

                                  BISHOP
                   Yes.  That follows.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But these things come from
                   eggs...so where are all the
                   eggs coming from.

                                  BISHOP
                   That is the question of the
                   hour.  We could assume a parallel
                   to certain insect forms who
                   have hivelike organization.
                   An ant of termite colony, for
                   example, is ruled by a single
                   female, a queen, which is the
                   source of new eggs.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're saying one of those things
                   lays all the eggs?

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, the queen is always physically
                   larger then the others.  A
                   termite queen's abdomen is so
                   bloated with eggs that it can't
                   move at all.  It is fed and tended
                   by drone workers, defended by
                   the warriors.  She is the center
                   of their lives, quite literally
                   the  mother of their society.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Could it be intelligent?

                                  BISHOP
                   Hard to say.  It may have been
                   blind instinct...attraction to
                   the heat of whatever...but she
                   did choose to incubate her eggs
                   in the one spot where we couldn't
                   destroy her without destroying
                   ourselves.  That's if she exists,
                   of course.

        Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (rising)
                   I want those specimens destroyed
                   as soon as you're done with them.
                   You understand?

        Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently
        in their cylinders.

                                  BISHOP
                   Mr. Burke have instructions
                   that they were to be kept alive
                   in stasis for return to the
                   company labs.  He was very specific.

        Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing.
        She slaps the intercom switch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      124

        In a small observation chamber separated from the med
        lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have
        squared off.

                                  BURKE
                   Those specimens are worth
                   millions to the bio-weapons
                   division.  Now, if you're smart
                   we can both come out of this
                   heroes.  Set up for life.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You just try getting a dangerous
                   organism past ICC quarantine.
                   Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

                                  BURKE
                   You've been doing your homework.
                   Look, they can't impound it if
                   they don't know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they will know about it, Burke.
                   From me.  Just like they'll know
                   how you were responsible for the
                   deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
                   colonists here --

                                  BURKE
                   Now, wait a second --

                                  RIPLEY
                          (stepping on him)
                   You sent them to that ship.  I
                   just checked the colony log...
                   directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
                   Signed Burke, Carter J.

        Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and
        rage finally have a target to focus on.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You sent them out there and you
                   didn't even warn them, Burke.
                   Why didn't you warn them?

                                  BURKE
                   Look, maybe the thing didn't even
                   exist, right?  And if I'd made it
                   a major security situation, the
                   Administration would've stepped
                   in.  Then no exclusive rights,
                   nothing.

        He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.

                                  BURKE
                   It was a bad call, that's all.

        Ripley snaps.  She slams him against the wall, surprising
        herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bad call?  These people are fucking
                   dead, Burke!  Well, they're going
                   to nail your hide to the shed...
                   and I'll be there when they do.

        She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter
        loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far
        more horrific revelation than any alien.

                                  BURKE
                          (sadly)
                   I expected more of you, Ripley.
                   I thought you would be smarter
                   than this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Sorry to disappoint you.

        She turns away and strides out.  The door closes.
        Burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           125

        Ripley is walking toward operations when a STRIDENT
        ALARM begins to sound.  She breaks into a run.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         126

        Ripley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOLE
        where Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered.  Hicks
        slaps a switch, killing the alarm.

                                  HICKS
                   They're coming.  They're in
                   the tunnel.

        The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up.
        TWO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light up
        simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
        vibrates the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing
                   on multiple targets.

        The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex.
        Their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm.
        A counter on the display counts down the number of
        rounds fired.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be wall to wall in
                   there.  Look  at those ammo counters
                   go.  It's a shooting gallery down
                   there.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUNS                 127

        blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels.  Their barrels
        are overheating, glowing cherry red.  One CLICKS empty
        and sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets it
        can't fire upon.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         128

        The digital counter on B gun reads zero.

                                  HICKS
                   B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.
                   Ten.  Five.  That's it.

        SILENCE.  Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up from
        sublevel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're at the fire door.

        The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, listen to that.

        Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wrecking
        SCREECH of claws on steel.  The intercom buzzes,
        startling them.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over)
                   Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have
                   some bad news.

                                  HUDSON
                   Well, that's a switch.

        INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATER                         129

        Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window,
        intently watching the AP station which is a dim
        silhouette in the mist.  Suddenly a column of flame,
        like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex
        at the base of the cone.

                                  BISHOP
                   That's it.  See it?  Emergency
                   venting.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long until it blows?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm projecting total systems
                   failure in a little under four
                   hours.  The blast radius will be
                   about thirty kilometers.  About
                   equal to ten megatons.

                                  HICKS
                   We got problems.

                                  HUDSON
                   I don't fucking believe this.
                   Do you believe this?

                                  RIPLEY
                   And it's too late to shut it down?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm afraid so.  The crash did too
                   much damage.  The overload is
                   inevitable, at this point.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,
                   too!  Four more weeks and out.
                   Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
                   rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Hudson, give us a break.

        They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded
        landscape.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Hicks)
                   We need the other drop-ship.  The
                   on one the Sulaco.  We have to
                   bring it down on remote, somehow.

                                  HUDSON
                   How?  The transmitter was on the
                   APC.  It's wasted.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (pacing)
                   I don't care how!  Think of a
                   way.  Think of something.

                                  HUDSON
                   Think of what?  We're fucked.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about the colony transmitter?
                   That up-link tower down at the
                   other end.  Why can't we use that?

                                  BISHOP
                   I checked.  The hard wiring
                   between here and there was severed
                   in the fighting.

        Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out
        options, grim solutions.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well then somebody's just going
                   to have to go out there.  Take a
                   portable terminal and go out there
                   and plug in manually.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, right!  Right!  With those
                   things running around.  No way.

                                  BISHOP
                          (quietly)
                   I'll go.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm really the only one qualified
                   to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
                   Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I
                   may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll
                   you need?

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Listen.  It's stopped.

        They listen.  Nothing.  An instant later comes the
        HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm.  Hicks
        looks at the tactical board.

                                  HICKS
                   Well, they're into the complex.

        INT. MED LAB                                            130

        One of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has
        yielded access to subfloor conduits.  Bishop lying in
        the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal
        as Ripley hands it down to him.  He pushes it into
        the constricted shaft ahead of him.  She then hands him
        a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
        cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.

                                  BISHOP
                   This duct runs almost to the
                   up-link assembly.  One hundred
                   eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes
                   to crawl down there.  One hour
                   to patch in and align the antenna.
                   Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
                   then about fifty minutes flight time.

        Ripley looks at her watch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's going to be closer.  You
                   better get going.

                                  BISHOP
                          (cheerfully)
                   See you soon.

        She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along
        ahead of him with a scraping rhythm.  The diameter of
        the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
        shoulders.  Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
        and begins spot welding it in place.

        INT. CONDUIT                                            131

        Bishop looks back as the welder seals him in.  He sighs
        fatalistically and squirms forward.  Ahead of him the
        conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity.  Like
        being in the bore of a very long Howitzer.

        INT. MED LAB                                            132

        Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the
        complex.

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   They're in the approach corridor.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (into mike)
                   On my way.

        Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her
        shoulder in one motion, and sprints for Operations with
        Vasquez.  The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in
        staccato bursts echoes from close by.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         133

        Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is
        mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras.
        The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
        video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
        corridor are occasionally visible.  The robot sentries
        hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into
        the swirling mist.

                                  HICKS
                   Twenty meters and closing.
                   Fifteen.  C and D guns down
                   about fifty percent.

        The digital readout whirl through descending numbers.
        An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts
        of fire.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now many?

                                  HICKS
                   Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's
                   down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

        Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly.
        The video image is a swirling wall of smoke.  Small fires
        burn, dim glows in the mist.  There are black and
        twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered
        at the edge of visibility.  However, nothing emerges
        from the wall of smoke.  The motion sensor TONE shuts off.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They retreated.  The guns stopped
                   them.

        The moment stretches.  Everyone exhales slowly.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  But look...

        The digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0"
        and "10" respectively.  Less than a second's worth of
        firing.

                                  HICKS
                   Newt time then can walk right
                   up and knock.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they don't know that.  They're
                   probably looking for other ways
                   to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Vasquez
                          and Hudson)
                   I want you two walking the perimeter.
                   I know we're all in strung out
                   shape but stay frosty and alert.
                   We've got to stop any entries before
                   they get out of hand.

        The two troopers nod and head for the corridor.  Ripley
        sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in
        one gulp.

                                  HICKS
                   How long since you slept?
                   Twenty-four hours?

        Ripley shrugs.  She seems soul weary, drained by the
        nerve-wracking tension.  When she answers, her voice
        seems distant, detached.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (grimly)
                   They'll get us.

                                  HICKS
                   Maybe.  Maybe not.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
                   those others.  You'll take care of
                   it won't you, it if comes to that?

                                  HICKS
                   If it comes to that, I'll do us
                   both.  Let's see that it doesn't
                   Here, I'd like to introduce you to
                   a close personal friend of mine.

        He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precise
        movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops
        out the magazine and hands it to her.

                                  HICKS
                   M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
                   under with a 30mm pump-action
                   grenade launcher.

        Ripley hefts the weapon.  It is heavy and awkward.  But
        there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
        cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will
        be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
        She raises it clumsily.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What do I do?

        INT. CONDUIT                                            134

        Bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
        infinities.  The pipe rings with his scraping advance.
        He approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
        shaft of light.  He puts his eyes up to the acid-etched
        opening.

        HIS P.O.V.  as drooling jaws flash toward us, SLAMMING
        against the steel with a vicious scraping SNAP.

        Bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
        inches along, looking pale and strained.  He glances at
        his watch.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         135

        Ripley has the stock of the M-41A snugged up to her cheek
        and is awkwardly trying to keep up with Hicks'
        instructions.  The Corporal is standing close behind her,
        positioning her arms.  It's intimate but that's the
        last thing on their minds.

                                  HICKS
                   Just pull it in real right.  It
                   will kick some.  When the counter
                   here heads zero, hit this...

        He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering
        on the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Just let it drop right out.  Get
                   the other one in quick.  Just
                   slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
                   Now, pull the bolt.

        CLACK.

                                  HICKS
                   You're ready again.

        Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly.  Her hands
        are trembling.  She indicates a stout TUBE underneath
        the slender pulse-rifle barrel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What's this?

                                  HICKS
                   Well, that's the grenade launcher
                   ...you probably don't want to
                   mess with that.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, you started this.  Now show
                   me everything.  I can handle myself.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  I've noticed.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           136

        DOLLYING WITH Ripley walking down the corridor, now
        carrying the newfound friend, the M-41A.  Gorman steps
        out of the door to the med lab, looking weak but sound.
        Burke is right behind him.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How do you feel?

                                  GORMAN
                   All right, I guess.  One hell
                   of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...
                   I...

                                  RIPLEY
                   Forget it.

        She shoulders by him into the med lab.  Gorman turns to
        see Vasquez staring at him with cold, slitted eyes.

                                  GORMAN
                   You still want to kill me?

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (turning away)
                   It won't be necessary.

        INT. MED LAB - ANNEX                                    137

        Ripley crosses the deserted lab, passing through the
        annex to the small O.R. where she left Newt.

        INT. MED LAB - O.R.                                     138

        Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around.
        Newt is nowhere to be seen.  On a hunch she kneels down
        and peers under the bed.  Newt is curled up there,
        jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep.  Still
        clutching "Casey."

        Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite
        the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
        the reality between dreams.  Ripley lays the rifle on
        top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without
        waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her.

        Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
        together in the darkness under their bed.

        Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some
        tormented dreamscape.  She cries out, a vague inarticulate
        plea.  Ripley rocks her gently.

                                  RIPLEY
                   There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all
                   right.

        EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139

        A VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing
        platform.  A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
        the silhouette of the station grows sharper.  Several
        systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
        conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
        the darkness.  High voltage discharges arc around the
        upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape
        with irregular glaring flashes.

        PAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G.  hunched against the wind at the
        base of the telemetry tower.  He has a TEST-BAY PANEL
        open and the portable terminal patched in.  His jacket
        is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
        it from the elements and he is typing frenetically.

                                  BISHOP
                          (to himself)
                   Now, if I did it right...

        He punches a key marked "ENABLE."

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT                       140

        The drop bay is empty and silent, with the remaining
        ship brooding in the shadows.  A KLAXON sounds and
        rotating clearance lights come on.  Hydraulics whine
        to life.  Drop-ship two moves out on its overhead track
        and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch-prep.
        Service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically
        around the hull.  A recorded announcement echoes across
        the huge chamber.

                                  FEMALE VOICE
                   Attention.  Attention.  Automatic
                   fueling operations have begun.
                   Please extinguish all smoking
                   materials.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB         141

        as she awakens with a start.  She checks her watch...
        an hour has passed.  She gently disengages herself from
        Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
        when she sees something and FREEZES.

        Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab,
        are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects.
        TWO STASIS CYLINDERS.  Their tops are hinged open, and
        the suspension fields are switched off.  They are both
        EMPTY.  Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
        rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the
        inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.  Unable to
        move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing
        the situation.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Newt.  Newt, wake up.

                                  NEWT
                   Wah...?  Where are...?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in
                   trouble.

        Newt nods, now wide awake.  They listen in the darkness
        for the slightest betrayal of movement.  The scrabble
        of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.

        There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
        Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
        underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
        wall.

        The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
        is jarringly loud in the stillness.

        When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
        herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
        reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
        mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle
        is GONE.

        She snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS
        TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with
        a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above
        her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams
        the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches
        above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with
        incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
        SQUEAL.

        Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
        frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She
        flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.

        They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around
        the shadowed room where every corner of space
        between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature
        scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
        back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close
        and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in
        the room had a million volts running through it.  She
        reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing
        happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights.
        Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically
        dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the
        observation window, glancing frantically over her
        shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming
        threat.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (shouting)
                   Hey...hey!

        She pounds on the window.  Through the double
        thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and
        empty.  Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling
        behind her.  Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her
        fear.  She steps in front of the video surveillance
        camera and waves her arms in a circle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks!  Hicks!

        INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR                142

        showing Ripley waving her arms.  There is no sound,
        a surreal pantomime.

        A hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor.
        Ripley's image vanishes.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Burke straightens casually from
        the console.  Hicks is talking via headset with
        Bishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight or
        Burke's action.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.  Check back when you've
                   activated the ship.
                          (turning)
                   He's at the up-link tower.

                                  BURKE
                          (calmly)
                   Excellent.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     143

        Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
        the observation window.  It bounces back from the
        high-impact material.  She tries again.

        REVERSE ANGLE  from the med lab side, showing her
        futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK
        barely audible through the double thickness pressure
        port.

        Ripley turns, studying the room.  She fumbles through
        a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
        finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT.  Snapping it on she
        plays the beam over the walls.  Tall assemblies of
        surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
        dark.  She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements.  The
        light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing
        frantically.  Like an indicator of her growing panic.
        Newt starts a thin, high wailing.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...mommmyyyyy...

        Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and
        the child's dependence on her.  She plays the beam
        across the ceiling.  Holds on something.  Gets an idea.
        She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
        up some papers from the counter.  Moving cautiously
        she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center
        of the room and clambers up after her.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
                   scared.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I know, honey.  Me too.

        Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
        under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
        SPRINKLER HEAD.  It triggers, spraying the room from
        several sources with water.  An ALARM sounds throughout
        the complex.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         144

        Hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finally
        identifying its source among the lights flashing on
        his board.  He bolts for the door, yelling into his
        headset as he moves.

                                  HICKS
                   Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
                   medical!  We got a fire!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     145

        Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers
        continue to drizzle in the darkness.  The SIREN
        hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley
        scans the room with her light, her hair plastered
        to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is
        eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She
        looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
        Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT
        HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
        splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles
        away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
        her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
        for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
        steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
        equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
        floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of
        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.

        She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
        its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,
        avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,
        backing away, until she is pressed up against a
        desk in one corner.

        Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
        back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around
        her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
        of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,
        knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
        Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her
        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's
        body.

        ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the
        desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking
        fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
        writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against
        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
        She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
        gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing
        itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.

        The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
        head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
        from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
        from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
        her face.

        A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
        behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.
        Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of
        pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks
        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
        into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits
        rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
        slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the
        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between
        the two of them they force is away from her face,
        though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
        sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the
        room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
        across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
        against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.

        Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,
        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
        coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,
        SHRIEKING creature.

                                  HICKS
                   The corner!  Ready?

                                  HUDSON
                   Do it!

        Hicks hurls the thing into the corner.  It scrabbles
        upright in an instant and leaps back toward them.
        WHAM!  Hudson gets it clean.

        Ripley collapses, gagging.  The alarm and sprinklers
        shut off automatically.  Hicks sees the stasis
        cylinders.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (coughing)
                   Burke...it was Burke.

        INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON                       146

        looking decidedly stressed-out.  He grips his rifle
        tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.

                                  HUDSON
                          (intense)
                   I say we grease this rat-fuck
                   son of a bitch right now!

        THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a
        chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of
        sweat betray intense concealed tension.  Only a few
        minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
        adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with
        high voltage.

                                  HICKS
                          (pacing)
                   I don't get it.  It doesn't
                   make any Goddamn sense.

        Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of
        her being accusing him with absolute outrage.  Burke
        tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a
        diamond drill.  He can't.

                                  RIPLEY
                   He wanted an alien, only he
                   couldn't get it back through
                   quarantine.  But if we were impregnated
                   ...whatever you call it...and then
                   frozen for the trip back at just
                   the right time...then nobody would
                   know about the embryos we were carrying.
                   We and Newt.

        Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figure
        sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the
        proceedings with somber eyes.  She is all but lost in
        an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still
        damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.

                                  HICKS
                   Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The only way it would work is if
                   he sabotaged certain freezers
                   on the trip back.  Then he could
                   jettison the bodies and make up
                   any story he liked.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fuuuck!  He's dead.
                          (to Burke)
                   You're dogmeat, pal.

                                  BURKE
                   This is total paranoid delusion.
                   It's pitiful.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (wearily)
                   You know, Burke, I don't know
                   which species is worse.  You don't
                   see them screwing each other over
                   for a fucking percentage.

                                  HICKS
                          (serious)
                   Let's waste him.
                          (to Burke)
                   No offense.

        Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to a
        sickened emptiness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Just find someplace to lock him
                   up until it's time to --

        THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  Everyone stops in the sudden darkness,
        realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
        struggle.  Hicks looks at the board.  Everything is out.
        Doors.  Video screens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They cut the power.

                                  HUDSON
                   What do you mean, they cut the
                   power?  How could they cut the
                   power, man?  They're animals.

        Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Stay close.
                          (to the others)
                   Let's get some trackers going.
                   Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch
                   Burke.

        Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move to
        the door.  Vasquez has to slide it open manually on its
        track.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           147

        The two troopers separate and move rapidly to the
        barriers at opposite ends of the control block.

        DOLLYING WITH VASQUEZ as she moves forward with feral
        steps in the darkness.

        ON HUDSON  scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Anything?

        BEEP.  Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.

                                  HUDSON
                   There's something.

        He pans it around.  Back down the corridor.  It beep
        again, louder.

                                  HUDSON
                   It's inside the complex.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (voice over)
                   You're just reading me.

                                  HUDSON
                   No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're
                   inside.  Inside the perimeter.
                   They're in here.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?

        ANGLE ON VASQUEZ  swinging her tracker and rifle together.
        She aims it behind her.  BEEP.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (cool)
                   Hudson may be right.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         148

        Ripley and Hicks share a look..."here we go."

                                  HICKS
                          (low)
                   It's game time.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get back here, both of you.  Fall
                   back to Operations.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           149

        Hudson backtracks nervously, peering all around.  He
        looks stretched to the limit.

                                  HUDSON
                   This signal's weird...must be
                   some interference or something.
                   There's movement all over the
                   place...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Just get back here!

        Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a
        moment before Vasquez.  They pull the door shut and
        lock it.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         150

        Hudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their
        armament.  Flamethrowers.  Grenades.  M-41A magazines.
        Hudson's tracker beeps.  Then again.  The tone continues
        through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!  Signal's clean.

        He pans the scanner.  Stops.  The range display reads
        out, counting down.

                                  HUDSON
                   Range twenty meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   Seal the door.

        Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.

                                  HUDSON
                   Seventeen meters.

                                  HICKS
                   Let's get these things lit.

        He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins priming
        the other himself.  It lights with a muffled POP.
        Ripley's lights a moment later.  Sparks shower around
        Vasquez as she begins welding the door.  Hudson's tracker
        is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They learned.  They cut the power
                   and avoided the guns.  They must
                   have found another way in, something
                   we missed.

                                  HICKS
                   We didn't miss anything.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fifteen meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, an acid hole in
                   a duct.  Something under the
                   floors, not on the plans.
                   I don't know!

        She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the same
        direction as Hudson's.

                                  HUDSON
                   Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big
                   fucking signal.  Ten meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right on us.  Vasquez,
                   how you doing?

        Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
        as she welds the door shut.  Working like a demon.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nine meters.  Eight.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Can't be.  That's inside the room!

                                  HUDSON
                   It's readin' right.  Look!

        Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.

                                  HICKS
                   Well you're not reading it right!

                                  HUDSON
                   Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

        He looks at Ripley.  It dawns on both of them at the same
        time.  She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
        her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead.  The
        tone gets louder.

        Hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
        acoustic drop-ceiling.  He shines his light inside.

        HICKS' P.O.V.                                           151

        A soul-wrenching nightmare image.  Moving in the beam of
        light are aliens.  Lots of aliens.  They are crawling
        like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams
        of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy
        acoustic panels.  They glisten hideously as they claw
        their way forward in silence.  They cover the ceiling
        of the operations room.  The inner sanctum is utterly
        violated.

        ON HICKS                                                152

        blasted by fear.

        Something moves...he snaps the light around.  It's a
        meter behind him.  IT LUNGES!  He drops reflexively,
        the claws raking across his armor.

        Hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
        en masse from the handholds.  THE CEILING EXPLODES,
        raining debris.  Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
        Newt screams.  Hudson opens fire.  Vasquez grabs Hicks,
        pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower.
        Ripley scoops up Newt and staggers back.  Gorman turns
        to fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit,
        the corridor connecting to the med lab.  In the
        strobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashes
        of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the
        flamethrower fires.  They move like nothing human...
        leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
        powerful, balletic grace.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Medical!  Get to medical!

        She dashes for the corridor.

        INT. MED LAB CORRIDOR                                   153

        DOLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becoming
        a frenzied blur.  Ahead of her Burke clears the door to
        the med lab.  HE SLIDES IT CLOSED.  Ripley slams into
        the door.  Tries the latch.  Hears it LOCK from the far
        side.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!  Open the door!

                                  NEWT
                   Look!

        Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
        locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
        inhuman as you can imagine.  Strobe flashes backlight
        the demented silhouette.  Shaking, Ripley raises her
        rifle.  She squeezes the trigger.  NOTHING HAPPENS.
        The creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances.
        Ripley checks the SAFETY.  The safety is off.  The
        DIGITAL COUNTER.  The magazine is full.  Newt begins to
        wail.  Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling
        so much she almost drops the rifle.  Panic screams in
        her brain.  The thing is almost on her, filling the
        corridor, when she remembers.  She snaps the bolt back,
        chambering a round.  Whips the stock to her shoulder.
        FIRES.  FLASH-CRACK!  A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shrieking
        jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching
        insanely.

        Ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil,
        blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         154

        Hicks looks up.  Fires POINT-BLANK at a leaping
        silhouette.  SCREEEECH!  The fire-control system has
        tripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and a
        mindless SIREN wailing.  Total pandemonium.

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Let's go!  Let's go!

                                  HICKS
                   Fuckin' A!

        Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawed
        arms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down.
        Another skeletal shape leaps on him from above.  He
        disappears into the subfloor crawlway.  Hicks, Vasquez
        and Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR

        Stunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
        creature rising to advance again.  Flinching against
        blast and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with a
        BLINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle right
        up toward the ceiling.  Newt covers her ears against
        the CONCUSSION.

                                  HICKS
                          (o.s.)
                   Hold you fire!

        The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (indicating door)
                   Locked.

                                  HICKS
                   Stand back.

        Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
        lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor.
        Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings
        her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the
        launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells.

                                  GORMAN
                   You can't use those in here!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Right.  Fire in the hole!

        She pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and
        the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door
        open, molten droplets flying.

                                  HICKS
                          (shouting at Vasquez)
                   Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   What?

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156

        Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three
        grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door
        home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding
        gonglike through the metal.

        Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door.
        Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his
        hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door
        they just passed through.

        INT. MED LAB                                            157

        Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the
        dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he
        crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
        concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves
        by itself.  The door opens slowly.

        ON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We
        hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158

        The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating
        slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of
        tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and
        tugs her across the room.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on!  This way.

        She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
        expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt
        starts inside but Ripley pulls her back.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Stay behind me.

        Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before
        he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a
        tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks,
        Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back
        fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl
        rapidly through the shaft.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on.  Crawl faster.

                                  RIPLEY
                   DO you know how to get to the
                   landing field from here?

                                  NEWT
                   Sure.  Go left.

        Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is
        enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs,
        scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor
        clatters in the confined space.  They approach an
        intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the
        corner, the looks.  Clear.

                                  NEWT
                   Go right.

        They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze
        becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower
        periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by
        louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
        lower levels.

                                  HICKS
                          (into headset)
                   Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.

        There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost
        unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   Yes, I read you.  Not very well...

        EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159

        Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
        mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.

                                  BISHOP
                          (yelling;
                          over enunciating)
                   The ship is on its way.  ETA
                   about sixteen minutes.  I've
                   got my hands full flying...
                   the weather's come up a bit.

        Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
        he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry
        updates rapidly.

        In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon,
        wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges.

        INT. AIR DUCT                                           160

                                  HICKS
                   All right, stand by there.  We're
                   on out way.  Over.

        The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the
        tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure.
        A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the
        tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Back.  Go back!

        They try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them,
        the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a
        FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
        flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses
        her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks
        snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the
        duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the
        tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (icy)
                   Losing fuel.

        Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the
        glistening apparitions closing in.  Hicks' torch feathers
        out.  Empty.  Bracing his back he kicks hard at the
        cherry-hot metal.  It bends aside.

        Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and
        conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole,
        lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.
        Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez'
        flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.
        Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM
        A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.

        She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head
        to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the
        metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying
        the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.

        Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into
        her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against
        the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to
        move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and
        turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her,
        grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
        safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have
        reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him,
        barely conscious.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (hoarse whisper)
                   You always were an asshole, Gorman.

        She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE
        it as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake...
        something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip.
        He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
        creatures are upon them.

        INT. SERVICE WAY                                        161

        RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run.
        The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind
        them and they stumble with the shock wave.  Newt breaks
        out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep
        up.

                                  NEWT
                   This way.  Come on, we're almost
                   there!

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, wait!

        The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around
        obstacles.  If it wasn't clear before it's clear now
        that we are on her turf, and she's the ace.  Running on
        and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls
        a directionless blur.  Newt never hesitates.

        They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which
        runs upward at a steep 45 degrees.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  Go up.

        INT. CHUTE                                              162

        Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the
        top...an exterior vent hood.  The sound of wind booms
        down from above.  Like blowing across a bottle top
        vastly amplified.

        Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow
        side ribs in the shaft.  She looks down.  The chute
        descends far into the depths, lost in shadow.  She
        starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks,
        just emerging from the side duct.

                                  NEWT
                   Just up there --

        Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot.  She
        slides...catches herself with one hand.  Ripley reaches
        for her, dropping her light.  The hand-light goes
        skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend,
        and disappears.

        Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's.
        They miss, inches apart.

                                  NEWT
                   Riiiiipppleee --

        She slips.  Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket.
        AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT.  With an echoing scream Newt
        plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness.

        MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
        a bobsled ride.  THe shaft pitches left.  Newt bounces,
        sliding halfway up the wall.  The chute forks ahead.
        Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a
        steeper angle into the depths.  Just disappearing down
        the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light.

        Ripley looks Hicks in the eye.  And kicks free...sliding
        down the chute after Newt.  Ripley slams her feet into
        the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent.
        Ripley reaches the "V."  Sees the glow of the light in
        the left fork.  She goes left.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!

        She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it
        has no direction.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Mommy...where are you?

        Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
        intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL.  The light
        is lying there, but no Newt.  The echoing wail comes
        again.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Moooommeeee...

        Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering.  Newt's call
        comes again.  Fainter?  She can't tell.  She spins in
        a growing panic, starts the other way.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to her headset)
                   Hicks, get down here.  I need
                   that locator.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        163

        Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes
        and machines.  It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist.
        She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating.
        Ripley's voice seems to come from there.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (o.s.)
                   Newt!  Star wherever you are!

        Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     164

        Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator
        from his belt.  They follow the signal into a lighted
        area where the power apparently was not cut.

                                  HICKS
                   This way.  We're close...

        Following the signal they come to a grating set in the
        floor.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.

        Ripley runs to the grating.  Looking down she sees Newt's
        tearstreaked face.  Newt reaches up.  Her tiny fingers
        wriggle up through the bars of the grate.  Ripley
        squeezes the child's precious fingertips.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Climb down, honey.  We have to
                   cut through this grate.

        Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts
        into the bars with his hand-torch.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        165

        Newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks
        shower blindingly as Hicks cuts.  She bites her lip,
        trembling.  Cold and terrified.  Silently a glistening
        shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
        her.  It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form.  Newt
        turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the
        shadow engulfs her.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     166

        Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
        She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing
        it down.  Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley
        lunges into the hole with her light.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Newt!

        The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly.
        Newt is gone.  Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
        "Casey" the doll head.  In sinks slowly, distorting,
        vanishing in darkness.

        Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole.  She struggles
        furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  Noooo!

        He drags her back.  It takes all of his strength.

                                  HICKS
                          (intense)
                   She's gone!  Let's go!

        He sees something moving toward them through a lattice
        of pipes.  Ripley is irrational.  Hysterical.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  No!  She's alive!  We
                   have to --

                                  HICKS
                   All right!  She's alive.  I
                   believe it.  But we gotta get
                   moving!  Now!

        He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the
        end of the tunnel.  Gets her inside, slamming her against
        the back wall.  Hits the button to go to surface level.
        An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts
        toward them.  The doors are closing.  Not fast enough.
        The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on
        it.  THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature.  THE
        WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.  Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK.  It
        spins away, SCREECHING.  Acid sluices between the closing
        doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields
        Ripley with his body.  The lift starts upward.  Hicks'
        fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
        toward his skin.  Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley
        claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can.  He
        screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm.  He
        shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping
        the smoking pieces to the floor.  Acrid fumes fill the
        air, searing eyes and lungs.  The elevator stops.  The
        doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks
        who is doubled over in agony.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Come on, you can make it.
                   Almost there.

        EXT. LANDING FIELD                                      167

        Drop-ship two descends toward the landing grid,
        side-slipping in hurricane gusts.  Bishop stands, guiding
        it with the portable terminal.  The ship sets down hard.
        Slides sideways.  Stops.  Bishop turns as Ripley and
        Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
        behind him.  He goes to them, helping to support Hicks
        and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale.
        Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.

                                  RIPLEY
                   HOW MUCH TIME?

                                   BISHOP
                   PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

                                   RIPLEY
                   WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

        The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship.

        EXT. PROCESSING STATION                                 168

        An infernal engine, roaring out of control.  Steam blasts
        and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and
        columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
        the air.

        We APPROACH, hypnotically.  The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME,
        moving toward the station.  It pivots, hovering in the
        blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING
        PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third
        of the way up the enormous structure.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          169

        Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and
        drops the roll.  She has crudely fastened a M-41A
        assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower.
        A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower.  Her
        movements are curt, precise...determined.  She works
        rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other
        gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the
        drop-ship.

        Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help
        Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight
        seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around
        him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain.

                                  BISHOP
                   Ripley...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She's alive.  They brought her
                   here and you know it.

                                  BISHOP
                   In seventeen minutes this place
                   will be a cloud of vapor the
                   size of Nebraska.

        Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands
        flying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, don't let him leave.

                                  HICKS
                          (grimacing with
                          pain)
                   We ain't going anywhere.

        She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins
        to the door controls.  The door opens.  Wind and
        machine-thunder blast in.

                                  RIPLEY
                   See you, Hicks.

        Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.

                                  HICKS
                   Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.

        Ripley grabs his hand.  They share a moment, albeit
        brief.  Mutual respect in the valley of death.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Ellen.

                                  HICKS
                          (nods with
                          satisfaction)
                   Don't be long, Ellen.

        Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to the
        open doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  The doors close.

        INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR                                   170

        The elevator descends.  Bars of light move rhythmically
        across her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watching
        the landings go by.  The heat grows more intense.  Pipes
        glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows.
        The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic.

        Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
        directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and
        she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a
        determination that holds the gut-panic in check.

        The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches
        a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the
        flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the
        bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the
        MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
        jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
        forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't
        know doodley about grenades.

        This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She
        begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers
        slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends.

        The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a
        bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly,
        the doors open.

        HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
        corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
        VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent
        into Dantean Hell.  The air itself vibrates with heat
        distortion.  Couplings groan.  Machinery whines and
        throbs.  Like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
        of massive pumps echoes through the station.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           171

        Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the
        rifle.  Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the lethal
        gloom.  Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to
        hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor.  Ahead
        the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
        and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins.
        She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR,
        taped to the top of her kludge weapon.

        A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

                                  VOICE
                   Attention.  Emergency.  All
                   personnel must evacuate
                   immediately.  You now have
                   fourteen minutes to reach
                   minimum safe distance.

        INT. CATACOMB                                           172

        Range and direction read out in rapid-fire alpha-numerics
        on the locator display.

        Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the
        swirling steam of the alien maze.  She approaches an
        intersecting tunnel.  Flashing emergency lights
        illuminate the insane fresco of the walls.  She spins,
        firing the flamethrower.  Nothing there.  She whirls
        back.  Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized.

        Skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre
        tormented positions like human insects in amber.
        Steam blasts, blinding her.  The locator signal
        strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low
        passage, turns again.  At each intersection she quickly
        lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it.
        For the way back.  She has to turn sideways, inching
        through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon
        niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin.

        SUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!  A hand.
        She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in
        the wall.  Carter Burke.

                                  BURKE
                   Ripley...help me.  I can feel
                   it...inside.  Oh, God...it's
                   moving!  Oh gooood...

        She looks at him.  No one deserves this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.

        She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around
        the spoon, and pulls the primer.  She moves on.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have eleven minutes to
                   reach minimum safe distance.

        Ripley moves ahead.  The locator signals shows she is
        almost there.  A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an
        earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet.  Then
        another.  The whole station seems to shudder.  A SIREN
        begins to wail a demented rhythm.  Following the tracker
        she turns a corner and stops.  The RANGE INDICATOR READS
        ZERO.  She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer
        bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel.  All hope
        recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        173

        Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
        edge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alien
        eggs.  Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
        aware of her surroundings.  The egg nearest her
        begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at
        its top to reveal something stirring within.  Newt
        stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs
        appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.  She
        SCREAMS.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          174

        Ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        175

        Newt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward
        her.  Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap,
        and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault
        rifle.  The flash illuminates the figure of an
        adult warrior, nearby.  It spins, moving straight
        for Ripley.  Firing from the hip she drills it with
        two controlled bursts which catapult it back.  She
        steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN.  Her expression is
        murderous.  AND AGAIN.  It spins onto its back.
        She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
        a fireball.  Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing
        at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the
        child.  She swings her up onto her back.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   I knew you'd come.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, I want you to hang on,
                   now.  Hang on tight.

        Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
        of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her
        weapon.  More warriors are moving toward her among
        the eggs.  She fires the flamethrower.  The eggs are
        engulfed.  One of the warriors lunges forward, a
        living fireball.  She blasts it in half with two
        bursts from the M-41A.  Ripley retreats, ducking under
        a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK
        fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is.

        A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN
        glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
        insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the
        Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable
        horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two
        powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
        distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells
        and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
        from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
        membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
        carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes
        she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside
        the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
        eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
        where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by
        DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
        of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen.

        Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She
        fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The
        grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
        ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous
        matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes
        berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
        Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
        everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel
        in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
        vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's
        shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two
        warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
        her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL
        COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the
        magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
        and OPENS UP.

        The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley
        backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy
        of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
        long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she
        dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal
        instinct.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          176

        Ripley runs, blindly, with panting intensity verging
        on hysteria.  Impressions crash upon her...the maze
        blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with
        explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting,
        red-hot steel hissing.  Reality itself is reduced to
        a concussive series of strobelike instants of
        relentless forward motion.

        She sees one of the flares she dropped and turns.
        Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations
        of the world shake.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        177

        Lashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG
        SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
        tissue behind it.  SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke,
        it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.

        INT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR                               178-
                                                                179

        Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing
        bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at
        indistinct shapes and shadows.  The weapon is empty
        when she reaches the freight elevators.  A mass of
        debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level,
        has demolished the life cage she descended in.  She
        slams the control for the other cage and hears the
        sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its
        slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED
        SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a
        silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black
        shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE
        QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The
        flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that.
        The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and
        looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at
        the approaching FIGURE.  The elevator won't be in time.
        She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
        screech beats in her ears.  She scrambles up the
        rungs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                       180

        Ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt
        clinging to her.  She dives aside as a POWERFUL
        BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its
        razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches
        from her.  Looking down through the grille she
        sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her,
        wet and leering.  She scrambles up, running, as
        the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her
        with the titanic force of the creature below.
        It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
        metal, pacing her from below as she runs.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          181

        Ripley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and
        sprints upward.  It rocks and shudders with the
        station's death throes.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have two minutes
                   to reach minimum safe
                   distance.

        INT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS                               182-
                                                                183

        The lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open.
        The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating
        the open lift cage.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          184

        Ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the
        metals stairs.  As she rises she hears the LIFT
        MOTORS start up.  Looking down through the lattice
        work of the station she sees the life cage start
        ominously upward.  She knows there is only one
        explanation for that.  She runs on, the stairwell
        becoming a crazy whirl around her.

        EXT. LANDING PLATFORM                                   185

        Ripley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams
        through the door opening onto the platform.
        Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she
        sees...THE SHIP IS GONE.

                                  RIPLEY
                   BISHOP!

        Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred,
        outrage at the final betrayal.  She scans the sky.
        Nothing.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (hysterical)
                   BISHOP!

        Newt is sobbing.

        The lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW.  Ripley turns,
        backing away from the doors toward the railing.  There
        is no place to run to on the platform.  EXPLOSIONS
        detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
        swell upward through the machinery.  The platform bucks
        wildly.  Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
        THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL.  More
        EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below.
        Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops.  The
        safety cage parts.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt; low)
                   Close your eyes, baby.

        The lift doors begin to open.  A glimpse of the
        apparition within.

        ANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT  as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT
        BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have thirty seconds to
                   reach...

        Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
        the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  A
        TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby,
        slamming the ship sideways.  Its extended landing legs
        foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous
        squeal of metal on metal.

        INT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION                           186-
                                                                187

        Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her.  Begins
        strapping in.  Bishop wrestles with the controls.  The
        landing legs retract, ripping free.  Ripley slams her
        seat harness latches home.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Punch it, Bishop!

        The entire lower level of the station disappears in a
        fireball.  The air vibrates with intense heat waves and
        concussion.  The drop-ship engines fire.  Ripley is
        slammed back in her seat.  The ship vaults out and up,
        Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees.
        Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur.

        EXT. STRATOSPHERE                                       188

        The drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
        the clear high night.  Below, the clouds light up from
        beneath from horizon to horizon.

        A SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud
        layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME.  The tiny ship is slammed
        by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched
        but functioning, toward the stars.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          189

        Ripley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
        they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are
        finally and truly safe.  Newt starts to cry quietly,
        and Ripley strokes her hair.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's
                   over.

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER               190

        The scorched and battered ship once again sits in its
        drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the
        engine.  Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
        hypnotically.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          191

        Bishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a
        comatose Hicks.

                                  BISHOP
                   I gave him a shot, for the pain.
                   We'll need to get a stretcher to
                   cart him up to medical.

        Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down
        the aisle to the loading ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
                   but that platform was just becoming
                   too unstable...

        INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHIP                             192

        Bishop continues as they move down the ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I had to circle and hope things
                   didn't get too rough to take you
                   off.

        Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp.
        She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You did okay, Bishop.

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, thanks, I --

        He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
        ramp next to his shoe.  SSSSSS.  Acid.  SOMETHING BURSTS
        FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood.
        It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN.
        Driven right through him from behind.  Bishop thrashes,
        seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is
        slowly lifts him off the deck.  Above them the Queen
        glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
        mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay.  It blends perfectly
        with the machinery until it begins to emerge.  Seizing
        Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
        aside, shredded, like a doll.  It descends slowly to the
        deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
        limbs, dripping acid and rage.  Still smoking where Ripley
        half-fried it.  The Queen is huge, powerful...and very
        pissed off.  It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in
        inhuman geometries.

        Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring
        hypnotized...terrified to break and run.  She lowers Newt
        to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt)
                   Go!

        Newt runs for cover.  The Alien drops to the deck, pivoting
        toward the motion.  Ripley waves her arms, decoying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here!

        Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her.
        Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her.
        Its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her.  She clears
        a door.  Hits the switch.  It WHIRRS closed.  BOOM.  The
        Alien hits a moment later.

        INT. DARK CHAMBER                                       193

        Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable
        machines.

        VARIOUS ANGLES  VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing...her feet
        going into stirruplike mechanisms.  Velcro straps
        fastened over them.  Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence.
        Her hand closing on a complex grip-control.  The HUM of
        powerful motors.  The WHINE of hydraulics.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         194

        The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as
        the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
        service channels which cross the deck.  The channels are
        covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
        to crawl through.

        INT. CHANNEL                                            195

        Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
        Alien appears above, seen through the bars.  A section of
        grille is ripped away behind her.  She scrambles
        desperately.  Another section is ripped away right at her
        heels.  Light pouring in.  The next will be right above
        her.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         196

        The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her.
        The parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing
        there.

        Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL.
        THE POWER LOADER.  Like medieval armor with the power of
        a bulldozer.  She takes a step...the massive foot
        CRASH-CLANGS to the deck.  She takes another, advancing.

        Ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see...
        Hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
        child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her
        now, banishing all fear.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get away from her, you bitch!

        The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps.

        WALLOP!  A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
        it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall.  It
        rebounds into a massive backhand.  CRASH!  It goes
        backward into heavy loading equipment.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (screaming)
                   Come on!

        The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with
        unbelievable fury.  The battle is joined.

        Claws swipe, tail lashes.  Ripley parries with radical
        swipes of the steel forks.  They circle in a whirling
        blur, demolishing everything in their path.  The cavernous
        chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH,
        CLANG, SCREECH.

        They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks,
        crushing two of the creature's limbs.  It lashes and
        writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her
        exposed body.  She lifts it off the ground.  The hind
        legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting
        it in.  The striking teeth extend almost a meter from
        inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars.
        She ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
        behind her dead in a spray of drool.  Yellow acid foams
        down the hydraulic arms toward her.  The creature rips
        at high-pressure hoses.  Purple hydraulic fluid sprays
        ...machine blood mixing with alien blood.  They topple,
        off balance.  The Queen pins her.  Ripley hits a switch.
        The power loader's CUTTING TORCH flares on, directly in
        the thing's face.  They roll together, over the lip of
        a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL LOADING AIRLOCK.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       197

        They crash together four meters below, twisted in the
        loader's wreckage.  The Alien shrieks, pinned.

        Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
        and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons.
        She slaps the red "INNER DOOR OVERRIDE" and latches the
        "HOLD" locking-key down.  A KLAXON begins to sound.  She
        hits "OUTER DOOR OPEN" and there is a hurricane shriek of
        air as the doors on which they are lying separate,
        REVEALING the infinite pit of stars, below.

        All this time the Alien has been lashing at her in a
        frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
        confined space.  The airlock becomes a wind tunnel,
        blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
        from the loader.  The air of the vast ship howls past her
        into space as she claws her way up a service ladder.

        INT. CARGO BAY                                          198

        Newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
        the floor toward the airlock.   Bishop, torn virtually in
        two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind,
        grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she
        slides past him.  He catches her arm and hangs on as she
        dangles, doll-like, in the airblast.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       199

        The Alien seizes Ripley's ankle.  She locks her arms
        around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of
        their shoulder sockets.

        The door opens farther, all of space yawning below.  The
        loader tumbles clear, falling away.  It drags the Alien,
        still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the
        depths of space.  Its SHRIEK fades, it gone.

        With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air,
        crawling over the lip of the inner doorway.  She releases
        the OVERRIDE from a second panel.  The inner doors close.
        The turbulent air eddies and settles.

        She lies on her back, drained of all strength.  Gasping
        for breath.  Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop
        still holding Newt by the arm.  Encrusted with his own
        vanilla milkshake blood.  Bishop gives her a small, grim
        smile.

                                  BISHOP
                   Not bad for a human.

        He winks.

        Ripley crosses to Newt.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   Mommy...Mommy?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Right here, baby.  Right here.

        Ripley hugs her desperately.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           200

        Ripley limps along the corridor, carrying Newt on her hip.
        The ship's systems hum comfortingly.  Newt's head rests
        on her shoulder.

                                  NEWT
                   Are we going to sleep now?

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.

                                  NEWT
                   Can we dream?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

        HOLD ON THEM AS they recede down the long straight
        corridor.

                                                         FADE OUT

   
                               THE END
ALONE IN THE DARK

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
          
               A dense forest on a dark, misty night.
          
               YOUNG EDWARD CARNBY (age 10), small, thin, and terrified,
               runs for his life.
          2
                The forest is pitch black. Young Edward ducks between trees,
               under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for
               breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as
               fast as he can.
          
               P.O.V. CREATURE:
               Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its
               P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him.
          
               As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through
               the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something
               bright. Edward runs towards it.
          
               Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running
               towards the bright light.
          
               P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
               The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge
               of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only
               Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.

               SUPER: 20 YEARS AGO
          
               The beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the
               dark forest.
               A dozen uniformed DEPUTIES move through the forest, shining
               their flashlights around, searching.
          
                The trees tower over them. A low fog hangs in the air. The
               flashlight beams can barely penetrate it.
          
               EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT                                           2
          
               A large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. A
               small, dense forest stretches out behind it.
          
               The sign on the front reads: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL LIGHT
               ORPHANAGE.

               CONTINUED:
          
          
               Several patrol cars are parked along the Orphanage's gravel
               driveway. DEPUTIES mill around the front lawn.
          
               Another patrol car pulls up. Out of it steps the SHERIFF
               (late 40s). DEPUTY ADAMS (mid-30s) approaches him.
          
                                   SHERIFF
                         What's going on, Adams?

                         Twenty kids live at this orphanage,
                         Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing.
          
               SISTER CLARA (mid-40s), an anxious-looking nun, stands on the
               front porch, wrapped in a shawl. She speaks with two
               DEPUTIES. The Sheriff walks up and listens in.
          
                                   SISTER CLARA
                         After the power went out, I went to check
                         on the children. But their beds were
                         empty. Every one of them. They just
                         disappeared...

               The Deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights.
               The trees are close together, blocking out the moonlight. A
               thick mist hangs in the trees.
          
               As Deputy Adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright
               light streaming through the trees up ahead.

               Deputy Adams comes through the trees and emerges into a
               clearing in the woods.
          
               He sees a Shed in the clearing up ahead. A bright light is
               posted over the Shed's front entrance.

               Deputy Adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the
               Shed.
          
               He sees that the door is open just a crack. On the door is a
               sign marked: DANGER, along with the symbol for ELECTRICITY.

               Deputy Adams enters the Shed.

              The Shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power
              cables, and various implements for repairing power lines.
          
              Deputy Adams sweeps through the Shed with his flashlight.
          
              He approaches a large transformer module that sits at the
              back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity.
          
              There's a LOW SHUFFLING sound. Deputy Adams stops.
          
              He carefully peers around behind the transformer. The space
              is too small for a full-size person.
          
              But sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young
              Edward. He clutches himself, shivering, frightened.

              The Sheriff stands with his Deputies. His walkie-talkie
              CRACKLES to life.

                          Sheriff! I found one! White, male, about
                          ten years old. Looks to be unharmed. He's
                          in a utility shed maybe half a mile from
                          the orphanage.

              Deputy Adams approaches Young Edward. He takes off his jacket
              and wraps it around Young Edward's shoulders.
          
              Young Edward pulls the jacket around him and smiles, still
              scared, but happy to see the Deputy.

              SUPER: 20 YEARS LATER
          
              EDWARD CARNBY (early 30s), lean and intense, wakes up. He
              quickly looks around to get his bearings.
          
              He sits in a large commercial airplane. The compartment is
              full of seated PASSENGERS.
          
                SMALL BOY (age 8) sits next to Carnby, looking up at him.
              The Small Boy's MOTHER (early 40s) sleeps next to him.
          
                                    SMALL BOY
                          Did you have a nightmare?
          
              Carnby looks at the Small Boy, curious. He doesn't respond.
          
                                    SMALL BOY (CONT'D)
                          You ate cheese with dinner. My mommy says
                          cheese gives you nightmares. Want to see
                          my coloring book?
          
              The Small Boy has a Halloween-themed coloring book open on
              his lap. It's a graveyard scene, full of cartoon drawings of
              ghosts, werewolves, and vampires.
          
                                    SMALL BOY (CONT'D)
                          I think there's a vampire living in my
                          closet, but my mommy says vampires and
                          ghosts aren't real. She says there's
                          nothing to be afraid of in the dark.
          
              Carnby weighs what he's going to say.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          Your mother is wrong. Being afraid of the
                          dark is what keeps most of us alive.
          
              The Small Boy's eyes open wide.
          
                                    SMALL BOY
                          Everybody else tells me not to be afraid.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          That's because they don't know the truth.

                Carnby exits the Terminal and heads over to a row of taxis
                waiting outside the Terminal. He doesn't carry a suitcase.
          
                                    CARNBY (V.O.)
                          So, maybe you're thinking I'm an asshole,
                          trying to scare this poor kid for no
                          reason. But that's where you're wrong.
                          Because I've got my reasons. There's a
                          world around you that you've trained
                          yourself not to see. You've willfully
                          closed your eyes. But your fear of the
                          dark is not a weakness. It's there to
                          protect you from things you'd better pray
                          you never see. My eyes were forced open a
                          long time ago. Now I know. Just because
                          you can't see something, doesn't mean it
                          can't kill you.
          
                Carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row. The taxi
                shifts into gear and drives off.
          
                Another taxi is parked up ahead. As Carnby's taxi passes it,
                the second taxi pulls out and follows it.

                Behind the wheel of the taxi sits JAMES PINKERTON (early
                50s). His face is drawn, grim. He wears dark sunglasses.
          
                The DRIVER lies dead in the backseat of Pinkerton's taxi.
          
                Carnby's taxi can be seen through the front windshield,

                Carnby rides in the backseat. He looks out the back
                windshield. A few cars back, Pinkerton's taxi follows them.
          
                Carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench-coat pocket.
                Inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic-looking head.

          Carnby turns to look out the back windshield. Pinkerton's
          taxi is still following from a few cars back.

               Carnby's taxi accelerates down the street, pulling away from
               Pinkerton's taxi.
          
               As soon as it's evident that they are on to him, Pinkerton's
               taxi speeds up to give chase.
          
               The two taxis rocket down the streets, swerving past cars,
               SCREECHING around corners.
          
               Carnby's taxi speeds down the streets, narrowly avoiding
               collisions with other cars and PEDESTRIANS.
          
               Pinkerton just plows through whatever's in his way, SMASHING
               past other cars, forcing Pedestrians to jump out of the way.
          
               Pinkerton accelerates and tries to force Carnby's taxi off
               the road. The taxi's GRIND against one another.
          
               Carnby's taxi SCREECHES around a corner, speeding into a side
               street that leads to the Market Street.

                A busy street crowded with PEDESTRIANS, open shops, and
                produce stalls.
          
                Carnby's taxi races down the busy Market Street, followed by
                Pinkerton.
          
                They swerve and SCREECH down the Street, cutting off other
                cars, and narrowly avoiding Pedestrians.
          
                But then Pinkerton's taxi ZOOMS up beside Carnby's taxi and
                BUMPS into it with a GRINDING CRUSH of metal.
          
                Not stopping, Pinkerton's taxi continues to GRIND into
                Carnby's taxi. The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around
                sideways.
          
                Pinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a
                parked car with a CRUSH of metal and SHATTERING glass.
          
                There's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi
                and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure,
                exchange a look. Pinkerton's expression is fierce.
          
                Pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to
                smash into Carnby's taxi again.
          
                The Cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. His
                face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. The Cabbie
                struggles to get loose.
          
                                      CABBIE
                            I'm trapped, man!
          
                                      CARNBY
                            I'll draw him away...
          
                As Pinkerton's taxi backs up, it CRASHES into a Van driving
                by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents
                of the Van onto the street.
          
                This gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract
                himself from the crushed taxi. He wrenches himself out the
                window, just in time to see Pinkerton's taxi accelerating
                towards him.
          
                Carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped
                Cabbie.
          
                Pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for
                the running Carnby. Pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him.
          
          
                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                CONTINUED:
          
          
                Carnby leaps out of the way as Pinkerton's taxi CRASHES into
                the side of a Building, narrowly missing him. Pinkerton's
                taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass.
          
                Carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the
                building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing
                on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at
                Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs.
          
                Pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the
                crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the
                street.
          
                Pinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to
                a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street.
          
                At the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and
                down the street.
          
                He spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians.
          
                Pinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the
                air with superhuman force.
          
                Pinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING
                into him with a tremendous impact.
          
                But Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton
                around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton
                CRASHING through the front window of a Bakery.

                Pinkerton comes CRASHING through the display window, landing
                in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass.
          
                But seemingly unfazed, he just picks himself up and walks
                back out the front door.

                Carnby stands in a crowd of BYSTANDERS, watching in surprise
                as Pinkerton exits the Bakery, his expression fierce.
          
                Pinkerton immediately spots Carnby and comes after him.
          
                Carnby bolts away, running into a Herbalist Store across the
                street.

                Jars of different shapes and sizes containing a variety of
                medicinal herbs and other such substances are on display.
          
                Carnby runs into the Herbalist Store, making his way through
                the displays.
          
                Pinkerton leaps right through the Herbalist Store's front
                display window in a hail of SHATTERED glass.
          
                He tackles Carnby, CRASHING through the jars on display.
          
                Pinkerton SLAMS Carnby to the ground. He grabs Carnby's head
                and SMASHES it against the floor once, then twice.
          
                Pinkerton tears open Carnby's trench-coat. He pulls out the
                burlap sack. He opens the sack, confirming the stone carving
                is inside it.
          
                While Pinkerton inspects the stone carving, Carnby's hand
                quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them.
          
                Carnby SMASHES the glass jar over Pinkerton's face.
          
                He grabs the stone carving out of Pinkerton's hand, scrambles
                to his feet, and runs.

                Carnby BURSTS out of the Herbalist Store's back door, exiting
                out into a small, cluttered Alley.
          
                Carnby lands hard in the debris, but he rolls with the fall
                and is back up on his feet, running.
          
                The Alley ends in a high Wall with a Billboard on top of it.
                The Wall has a railing along one side.
          
                Carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running.
          
                The Alley is crowded with WORKERS unloading crates out of the
                loading dock of the Ice Factory.
          
                A BEAT COP walks by. Carnby runs past the Beat Cop, just
                barely bumping into him.
          
                But as Carnby passes him, he deftly grabs the Beat Cop's gun
                from his holster.
          
                The Beat Cop doesn't even notice his gun is missing as he
                turns, annoyed to see Carnby racing away.
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                          Hey!
          
                Pinkerton runs out of the Herbalist Store's back door. He
                runs directly at the high Wall.
          
                Pinkerton leaps up, scrambling right up the side of the Wall.
                He hauls himself up the Billboard, until he's standing at the
                top of the Billboard itself.
          
                Pinkerton looks down below and spots Carnby running into the
                loading dock of the Ice Factory.
          
                Pinkerton leaps off the Billboard.
          
                The Beat Cop looks up, stunned to see Pinkerton leaping
                towards him.
          
                Pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates, CRUSHING
                the crates on it. The WORKER pushing the dolly falls back,
                shocked. Pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing
                after Carnby.
          
                The Beat Cop fumbles for his gun. It's not there. Pinkerton
                smashes the Beat Cop out of the way as he pursues Carnby.
          
                The Beat Cop flies into a pile of crates, knocked out.
                Pinkerton follows Carnby into the Ice Factory.
          
                INT. ICE FACTORY

                The refrigerated Ice Factory is filled with neat rows of ice
                blocks. FACTORY WORKERS mill about, transporting the blocks
                of ice through the Factory.
          
                Carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks. He checks the
                Beat Cop's gun to make sure it's loaded. It is.
          
                Carnby stops, sensing something.
          
                In one fluid motion, Carnby suddenly spins, turning in the
                other direction and FIRING the gun.
          
                We follow the bullet as it rockets through the Ice Factory.
                It WHIZZES along, until we see Carnby's intended target.
          
                Pinkerton comes through the Ice Factory, running at Carnby.
                The bullet flies directly at him.
          
                The bullet hits Pinkerton in the shoulder. But it only seems
                to anger Pinkerton further. He keeps running at Carnby.
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)
          
            
          
               CONTINUED:
          
          
               Pinkerton leaps at Carnby. Carnby FIRES again. But Pinkerton
               dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice, SHATTERING it
               in a hail of ice shards.
          
               Pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks
               of ice blocks.
          
               Carnby tries to track Pinkerton's movements through the ice
               stacks. He hears the sound of Pinkerton MOVING, but can't see
               him. His gun is ready. He searches around.
          
               Suddenly, there's a RUSH of movement behind him. Carnby
               dodges just as Pinkerton's fist comes flying out. Pinkerton
               connects with an ice block, SHATTERING it.
          
               Carnby is backed into a dead end in the Ice Factory. He turns
               to face Pinkerton, gun ready.
          
               But Pinkerton is on him too quickly. He lunges at Carnby,
               hoisting him over his head and SLAMMING him down on a
               conveyer belt.
          
               Pinkerton drags Carnby along the conveyer belt. But Carnby
               grabs a hanging chain to steady himself. With a quick kick,
               Carnby uses the momentum to flip Pinkerton over him.
          
               Pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick
               wedged into the wall. The sharp point of the ice pick punches
               right through Pinkerton's torso, impaling him. He is
               immediately killed.
          
               Carnby leans up against the wall, steadying himself. He pulls
               the stone carving out of his pocket to check it. In the
               fight, the carving has been cracked into pieces.
          
               But the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it, a
               small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving.
          
               The artifact is a gold circle, flat on the top and bottom,
               its thick round side engraved with intricate Abkani symbols.
               This is the lynchpin artifact, the piece which connects the
               other artifacts together.

               CREWMEN scurry around the deck attending to a huge crane that
               hangs over the side of the Ship. Chains leads from the crane
               into the water.
          
               DR. LIONEL HUDGENS (mid-60s), wiry and severe with a sharp
               intelligence, stands on the deck with CAPTAIN CHERNICK (late

               The crane is engaged. The chains run through the mechanism of
               the crane, pulling something to the surface.
          
               The crane GROANS under the weight. Captain Chernick looks

               Out of the ocean, the crane raises a large, heavy container.

               Several bookshelves, all crammed with books, line one wall. A

               Outside the windows, the sun is setting.
          
               Approaching the lab area, Carnby takes out the lynchpin

               The Ship is docked at a mist-enshrouded pier. Overhead lights

               A transport truck is parked on the Dock just next to the

                Standing on the Ship's wide deck, Captain Chernick looks
                impatient. Hudgens stands over the large, barnacle-covered
                container. The container is secured with a heavy rusted lock.
          
                Two large, muscular men, the FIRST MATE and CREWMAN BARNES,
                check the chains connecting the container to the huge crane
                on the deck. They are preparing to load it onto the truck on
                the Dock.
          
                                       CAPTAIN CHERNICK

                             what you're looking for?

                             The conditions must be perfect.
                             Otherwise, there will be... consequences.
          
                Captain Chernick steps up to the barnacle-covered container.
                He notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten
                scraped off in the transport.
          
                Under the barnacles, the container is revealed to made of
                gold. Chernick look startled.
          
                Captain Chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and
                looks closely at it.
          
                                       CAPTAIN CHERNICK
                             Is this made of solid gold?
          
                                       HUDGENS
                             Did you know the Abkani were the first
                             civilization to use gold for their
                             valuables? They believed it held the
                             power to contain evil spirits. Thousands
                             of years later, we don't even remember
                             why gold was valuable to us in the first
                             place. Now, let's load it onto the truck.
          
                Captain Chernick exchanges a look with the First Mate and
                Crewman Barnes. They both give him a subtle nod.

                Chernick pulls out a pistol.
          
                                    CAPTAIN CHERNICK
                          But I'm looking forward to finding out.
          
                Chernick smacks Hudgens across the face with his pistol.
                Hudgens gives Chernick a grim look.

                          I suppose one should not be surprised
                          when mercenaries act mercenary.
          
                 rewman Barnes grabs Hudgens and twists his arms behind his
                back, incapacitating him. The First Mate pulls out a revolver
                and points it right at Hudgens' face.

                         You're making a terrible mistake.
          
                                   CAPTAIN CHERNICK
                         The only mistake would be letting you
                         walk out with whatever's in there.
                         Barnes...
          
               Crewman Barnes SMASHES Hudgens' head against the container.
               Hudgens is dazed from the blow.
          
                                   CAPTAIN CHERNICK (CONT'D)
                         Throw him in there.
          
               Crewman Barnes throws the dazed Hudgens into a Storage Room
               built onto the Deck. He slams the thick metal door closed.
               The door has a small, glass-covered peephole built into it.
          
               Chernick pries open the lock with the crowbar. Chernick hands
               the First Mate the crowbar and he jams it into the handle of
               the door, wedging it closed.

               Hudgens struggles to his feet. He BANGS on the door, trying

               Carnby suddenly winces in intense pain. He clutches his head,

                In one of the shelving units, a faint glow emanates out of a

                Something in another drawer begins glowing. Then the contents

               The First Mate and Crewman Barnes pull out revolvers. They
               approach the Storage Room door.
          
               There's a WHOOSH of movement behind them. The three men all

               invisible. He is hoisted into the air. He looks shocked.
          
               Captain Chernick seems to be floating just above the ground,
               although it is clear something invisible is holding him up.

               Captain Chernick's body contorts, as if something had been
               thrust into it. With a burst of blood, a hole is ripped into
               his torso, killing him.
          
               Captain Chernick's lifeless body is dropped to the ground.
          
               Terrified, the First Mate and Crewman Barnes aim their

               Hudgens stands at the door, listening to the GUNFIRE.
          
               He looks through the peephole in the door. The peephole is
               dirty, hard to see through. Something frantic is happening
               outside the door, but it's hard to see exactly what.
          
               There is more GUNFIRE and then SCREAMING. Short BURSTS of
               AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE follow, and more SCREAMING.
          
               And then, all is quiet.
          
               Hudgens grabs a discarded metal rod and jams it into the door
               handle, wedging it closed. He backs away from the door. The
               only weapon he can see is a box-cutter. He grabs it, holding
               it out in front of him.
          
               Suddenly, there's a CRASH at the door. Something pushes at
               the door, trying to get in. The door RATTLES and THUMPS from
               the impact.
          
               Hudgens, still holding the box-cutter, strains against the
               door, using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut. The
               metal rod wedged against the door is starting to buckle.
          
               Suddenly, the door is still. Hudgens waits. Nothing.
          
               There's a CRASH as another impact hits the door. The RACKET
               is even more intense. But the door holds.
          
               Finally, the thrashing stops. All is quiet again.
          
               The lights in the Storage Room stop flickering. They come
               back on. Hudgens listens, straining to hear anything at all.
          
               Cautious, Hudgens pulls away the metal rod. He gingerly
               touches the door. With a long CREAK, it slowly swings open.
               The crowbar was shaken loose from all the impacts.

               Bodies lie everywhere, Captain Chernick, the First Mate,

               their slashed, ripped open bodies.
          
               Bullet holes are pocked around the Deck. Streaks of blood are

               remain of the battle.

               empty gold container.
          
               He reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of
               the container.
          
               The panel opens, revealing a small artifact. The artifact is
               a thin hollow cylinder with a thick little protrusion on one
               end. It is covered in Abkani symbols.
          
               Hudgens takes out the artifact. He turns it around in his
               hand. He looks pleased.

               Everything in Bureau 713's Headquarters looks sleek and high-
               tech. There are no windows anywhere.
          
               COMMANDER BURKE (late 30s) strides purposefully down the
               hallway. He is confident to the point of arrogance.
          
               His second-in-command, AGENT MILES (mid-30s), driven and
               efficient, hurries to keep up.

                         Sir, we're getting some strange readings
                         in the control room.

                         even crack my radar. Now what's the
                         situation?
          
          
                                   AGENT MILES
                         Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal
                         activity range from three to five...

                         Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors
                         picking up now?
          
               Burke and Miles arrive at the Control Room. Burke nods to two
               BUREAU GUARDS standing at the entrance.

               Inside the Control Room, the banks of monitors and sensors
               are all lit up. Streams of data flow across the monitors.
          
               Burke and Miles stand at the doorway.
          
               AGENT "KRASH" KRASHINSKY (mid-30s), a cool and collected
               female tech-geek, scans through data on the monitors. She
               always wears a headset.
          
                                   BURKE

               Young Edward (age 10) walks through the Den. The lights are
               all out. The Den is musty, but clean.
          
               A sliver of light glows from underneath the doorway to Sister
               Clara's bedroom. Young Edward KNOCKS softly on the door.
          
               Sister Clara opens the door. She wears her nightgown.
          
                                   SISTER CLARA
                         Still having trouble sleeping, Edward?
                         You can't stay up all night, you know.

                From a window on the ground floor, SISTER CLARA (now mid-60s)
                watches him.
          
                A few CHILDREN play on the Orphanage's front lawn. They all
                look over at Carnby, curious, eager.
          
                Carnby exits his SUV. He looks around at the Orphanage

               MISSING PERSON REPORT flashes onscreen. It's the final name
               of the list. Carnby makes a note next to the name.
          
               Carnby hits PRINT and the report comes out of the printer. He
               adds it to a small stack of similar reports.
          
               Each report has a photo of a missing Orphan, both MALE and
               FEMALE. One of the photos is of John Houghton.

               The outdoor patio of a downtown Restaurant. Carnby sits with
               a coffee and a cherry pie at a table for two.
          
               AGENT PAUL FISCHER (mid-50s), precise but friendly,
               approaches the table and sits down across from Carnby.
          
                                   FISCHER
                         Why did I agree to this?
          
               A WAITER walks up. He puts down a plate of pecan pie in front
               of Fischer. The Waiter smiles and walks away.
          
                                   CARNBY
                         I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan.
          
               Fischer gives Carnby a smirk.
          
                                   FISCHER
                         You've got a good memory, Carnby.
          
               Fischer takes a bite of the pecan pie.
          
               Fischer pulls out a file and slides it across the table.
               Carnby opens the file. Inside it are photos and reports on
               the three remaining Orphans from Carnby's list.

                         I tracked down the three you asked about.
                         They all disappeared last night. Same
                         story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and
                         walked out in the middle of the night.

                         I ran full cross-references. Nothing much
                         in common between them. Except they all
                         grew up in the same orphanage. Your

                         still got friends at 713.

               Then, Aline rears back and PUNCHES Carnby in the face. Hard.
          
               Carnby takes the hit, rubbing his jaw.

                         I was in the Amazon for six weeks,
                         tracking poachers through their transport
                         lines. Then I fell in with a group of ex-
                         Chilean military selling artifacts on the
                         black-market. This was found in a gold
                         mine in the southern tip of Chile.

                         Just to let me know you were alive.
          
               Aline picks up the lynchpin artifact, inspecting it. She runs
               her fingers over the Abkani symbols carved into it.

                Aline and Carnby stand at a work station. A piece of cloth
                covers up something on the work station.
          
                 line pulls back the cloth, revealing three Abkani artifacts.
          
                Each of the three artifacts is a gold ring, one small and
                thin, one medium and slightly thicker, and one large. The
                large ring is shaped like a pyramid with the top cut off and
                has thin protrusions on its base. Each of the ring artifacts
                is well-worn from age and engraved with Abkani symbols.
          
                Aline puts the lynchpin artifact down next to the others.

                          They were found in completely different
                          locations. Alaska. Newfoundland.
                          Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile.

                          Ten thousand years ago, it would've been
                          like burying them at the ends of the
                          earth.
          
                Aline picks up the lynchpin artifact again. She runs her
                fingers over one symbol in particular, carved into the flat
                top of the artifact: the DARK SPIRIT.

                          The Abkani's written language is based on
                          pictograms. Combinations of symbols to
                          create different meanings. But there's
                          one here I've never seen before.

                          grid. Something's definitely wrong with
                          our power. Get someone down here, pronto.
          
                The Guard hangs up the phone.
          
                There's a WHOOSH of movement behind him. The Guard turns to
                the sound. Silence.
          
                He flicks on his flashlight, shining the beam into the dark
                corners of the area. Nothing is there.
          
                Something CLATTERS in another room. The Guard quickly turns
                to the sound of the movement.

                Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway. Framed art hangs from
                the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way.
          
                The overhead lights in the Hallway emit only a low glow,
                flickering sporadically.
          
                Aline leads the way with a flashlight. They come up to a door
                to a second Hallway.
          
                The hairs on the back of Carnby's neck rise up. He touches
                the back of his neck, spooked. Aline notices.

                          up.
          
                Aline gets it.
          
                Carnby pulls out his PARA-METER. It's an old, battered
                device. The display lights up as Carnby turns it on. The para-
                meter immediately picks up some readings.
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                Carnby listens at the door. Carnby nods to Aline as he opens
                the door. Nothing is there.

                The Guard enters the Ceramics Room. The overhead lights give
                off only low glows, flickering sporadically.
          
                The display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows.
          
                The Guard walks through the room, shining his flashlight
                around. He can't see anything out of the ordinary.
          
                A WHOOSH of movement slips past the Guard. He turns quickly.
                Nothing.
          
                He shines his flashlight around, looking for anything out of
                the ordinary. He stands with his back to a display case.
          
                From out of the shadows behind the display case, a long,
                segmented tail emerges.
          
                 The tail is covered in hard, dark scales. At the end of the
                tail is a sharp spike.
          
                The tail suddenly flicks at the Guard, piercing him through
                the back of the head and out his mouth. The tail's spike
                glistens with fresh blood.
          
                The Guard's flashlight CLATTERS to the floor. The bulb
                BREAKS.
          
                The tail withdraws from the Guard. The Guard's body falls to
                the ground, dead.

                Aline leads the way with the flashlight, followed by Carnby.
                The Hallway is only faintly lit.
          
                From up ahead, they hear a CLATTERING sound.
          
                Carnby reaches into his holster and pulls out his revolver.
                Aline hands him the flashlight without a word.

               Aline and Carnby quietly come out a service door that leads
               to the Ceramics Room. They conceal themselves behind a pair
               of columns, scanning the area before they step out.
          
               The lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through
               the area.
          
               Aline is about to speak, but Carnby puts a finger to his
               mouth and shakes his head, no.
          
               The dead body of the Guard lies in a pool of blood on the
               ground. There seems to be no one else around.
          
               But then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a XENOMORPH
               CREATURE emerges out of the shadows.
          
               The xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. It is seven feet
               tall, covered in thick, dark scales. It stands on two legs,
               with long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a
               segmented, spiked tail poised behind it.
          
               Its demonic head has black, sunken eyes and a severe jaw
               lined with jagged, fang-like teeth. The head is identical to
               the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased.
          
               Carnby and Aline look shocked. They freeze, not moving a
               muscle.
          
               Another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows.
          
               The two creatures congregate in the middle of the room. They
               are the same hulking, grotesque brutes.
          
               The two creatures start to communicate. An unintelligible
               language passes between them.
          
               Suddenly, one of the creatures looks up, sensing something.
          
                The creature looks directly at Carnby and Aline, hiding
               behind the columns.
          
               The creature delivers a SHARP WHISPER.
          
               And with that, the creature fades into invisibility. It has
               totally disappeared.
          
               The second creature immediately follows suit, also fading
               invisible.

                Carnby and Aline scramble to their feet and sprint back
                towards the service door.
          
                An invisible creature comes racing after them. All that is
                visible is the effect of the creature's movement. It knocks
                over a statue as it chases after them. The statue SMASHES to
                the ground.
          
                Aline is through the door. Carnby runs through it and Aline
                pulls it closed behind them.

                Aline and Carnby run down the long Hallway, towards a pair of
                double-doors at the other end.
          
                The service door behind them bursts open. An invisible
                creature runs down the Hallway towards them.
          
                As the invisible creature runs, it knocks framed art off the
                walls, smashes aside tables and chairs. The creature isn't
                visible, only the effect of its movement.
          
                Carnby turns and FIRES his gun at the on-rushing creature.
          
                But his bullets don't hit anything except the wall on the
                other side of the Hallway.
          
                Carnby keeps FIRING, still not hitting anything.
          
                The invisible creature races towards them.
          
                Suddenly, the double-doors at the other end of the Hallway
                burst open. The second invisible creature starts running
                towards them.
          
                Both directions down the Hallway are now blocked.
          
                Carnby spots an open door marked STORAGE ROOM. He pushes
                Aline into it and jumps in after her.

                Carnby leans up against the door, pushing it closed. Aline

          There's a CRASH as the creature SLAMS against the other side
          of the door. Carnby strains to keep it closed. The door
          RATTLES as the creature CRASHES into it again.
          
          Aline finds the right key. She gets it into the lock.
          
          Suddenly, the creature PUNCHES a clawed hand right through
          the door.
          
          The hand is visible as it digs its claws into Aline's arm.
          The claws cut deep gashes into her. She SCREAMS in pain.
          
          The impact knocks the key out of the lock. Aline drops the
          keys as she clutches her arm.
          
          The creature's arm retracts out the hole in the door. It
          SMASHES into the door even harder, trying to break through.
          
          Carnby strains against the door, trying to keep it closed.
          
                              CARNBY
                    Can't hold it...
          
          Aline grabs her keys. She finds the right key, jams the key
          in the lock, and turns the bolt.
          
          There's another CRASH at the door. But the lock holds.

                    No! Why didn't you ask me that before you
                    pushed me in here?
          
          There's another CRASH. Carnby and Aline back away from the
          door. The door starts to buckle from the impacts.
          
          Carnby reloads his revolver. He has it ready.
          
          But then the CRASHING stops. Aline and Carnby listen.
          Everything is quiet.
          
          The sound of HELICOPTERS can be faintly heard in the

               Aline shines the flashlight around. She hears a WHOOSH of
               movement behind her and shines the flashlight towards it.
          
               The sound of a quickly approaching HELICOPTER can be heard in

               The double-doors BURST open as an invisible creature SMASHES

               It chases after them, knocking everything in its path out of

               Carnby and Aline run.
          
               Up ahead of them, the second invisible creature comes
               CRASHING through the display cases, heading right for them.
          
               Carnby and Aline are trapped between the two invisible
               creatures. They have nowhere to run.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

               Suddenly, powerful spotlights switch on, shining bright blue
               beams through the skylight. Another set of spotlight beams
               shine through the high windows lining the Main Hall.

               EXT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS
          
               A sleek black Bureau 713 helicopter hovers over the building.
               A pair of spotlights shine beams down through the skylight.

               In a hail of shattered glass, AGENTS BARR (male), CHEUNG
               (female), and MARKO (male) burst through the skylight,
               rappelling down on zip-lines from the hovering helicopter.
          
                They each carry a sleek, high-tech assault rifle with a lamp
               mounted on the top. They all wear full Bureau 713 combat
               gear, body armor with a headset comm-link and a helmet with a
               dark visor mounted on it.
          
               The creatures HISS in reaction and scramble out of the
               spotlights from the helicopter.
          
               The Agents immediately open FIRE. Their bullets glow with a
               pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air.
          
               All Carnby and Aline can see is the Agents shooting glowing
               bullets into the unnaturally long shadows.
          
               But the SQUEAL of one of the creatures shows that the Agents'
               bullets have found their target.
          
               As the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily
               flashes visible, then invisible again.
          
               The two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the
               shadows.
          
               The Agents cut their zip-lines, dropping to the ground.
          
               As they land, they all flip on their rifle-mounted lamps. The
               bright blue beams cut through the darkness.
          
               Their movements are precise, controlled. They all have their
               rifles out, scanning the area.
          
               Agent Barr has a high-tech scanning device attached to his
               rifle. It is an updated version of Carnby's para-meter that
               monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. It is
               used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures.

                A long shadow slips across the room. Agent Cheung sees it.
          
                                       AGENT CHEUNG
                          There!
          
                Agent Cheung opens FIRE. Agents Barr and Marko are
                immediately at her side, FIRING at the invisible creature.
                Their bullets glow as they streak through the air.
          
                But the creature is too fast. The glowing bullets streak
                through the air, but don't hit it.

                Agents Cheung and Marko open FIRE, sending streams of glowing
                bullets across the Main Hall. But they don't hit anything.
          
                Agent Barr scans around with his rifle-mounted para-meter and
                lamp. Nothing.
          
                Carnby and Aline stand back, not wanting to get in the
                Agents' way, not equipped to really help.
          
                The dim lights suddenly flicker and come back on at full
                strength, bathing the debris of the battle in a warm glow.
          
                Agent Barr turns his rifle to Carnby and Aline. They stand
                their ground, facing him.

               the creatures are gone.

                         Burke, we're secure. And sir... Carnby is

               The lights around the Museum have come back on.
          
               A pair of Bureau 713 Humvees are parked with large spotlights
               set up in front of them, shining into the Museum.
          
                ommander Burke stands with Agent Miles. They both wear full
               combat gear, visors, and headset comm-links. Burke addresses
               five AGENTS in combat gear.
          
                                   BURKE
                         I want a full security sweep. Miles, get
                         Fischer to send his sci-and-spy boys down
                         here. Now go.
          
               The Agents stream into the Museum in formation. Burke and
               Miles follow in after them.

               The silhouettes of the five Agents, Burke, and Miles come
               through the spotlight beams as they enter the Museum.
          
               Burke strides up to Carnby and Aline, who stand with Agent
               Barr. Miles follows after him.
          
                                   BURKE
                          hat the hell are you doing here, Carnby?

                         You used to be able to take care of
                         yourself, Carnby. Gotten soft since you
                         left 713?

          Miles steps in between Burke and Carnby.
          
                              AGENT MILES
                    Ms. Cedrac, I'm Agent Miles. This is
                    Commander Burke.
          
                              BURKE
                    Aline Cedrac. Pleasure to meet you. How's
                    the Ph.D. coming along?
          
          Aline looks surprised that Burke knows so much about her.
          
                              ALINE
                    It's fine. Thanks.
          
          Burke sees Aline's arm is bleeding from the gashes clawed
          into her by the creature.
          
                              BURKE
                    Miles, get her to a medic.
          
          Aline looks over at Carnby. He nods to her.
          
                              CARNBY
                    I'll catch up.
          
          Agent Miles escorts Aline out of the Museum.
          
          Burke and Carnby regard one another.
          
                              BURKE
                    Why am I still looking at you?
          
                              CARNBY
                    I need to know what those things are.
          
                              BURKE
                    That information's classified. If you
                    were still an agent, you'd already know.
                    But since you're not, stay out of my way.
          
          Burke turns to stride away. Carnby grabs his arm. Burke turns
          back, annoyed.
          
                              CARNBY
                    I'm asking nicely.
          
           Burke grabs Carnby's arm, trying to twist it away. But
          Carnby's fast enough to slip out of Burke's hold.
          
          Now angry, Burke grabs Carnby by the collar, shoving him
          against a stone column.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                But Carnby deftly twists out of Burke's grip and shoves him
                up against the same stone column.
          
                In the struggle, Carnby's hand flicks into Burke's pocket.
          
                Agent Barr intervenes, pulling Carnby away. Burke straightens
                himself out, trying not to look rattled.
          
                                    BURKE
                          Get him out of here!
          
                Carnby shrugs off Agent Barr and walks away.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          You're right, Commander. I guess I have
                          gone soft.
          
                As Carnby walks off, he looks down in his hand. He has lifted
                Burke's I-D card out of his pocket.

                Aline sits in the back of a 713 Emergency Medical Vehicle. A
                713 MEDIC finishes dressing the cuts on her arm.
          
                Carnby approaches her. Aline nods to the Medic and gets up to
                join Carnby. They speak quietly.

                          Commander, I need to get to my office.
          
                                    BURKE
                          The museum's quarantined until we're
                          done.
          
                                    ALINE
                          At least let me pack up my work. There's
                          priceless artifacts in there. If they get
                          damaged...
          
                Burke looks up at Aline. He gives a minute nod to Miles.
          
                                    BURKE
                          If you notice anything out of the
                          ordinary, let me know immediately.
          
                Aline looks around at the Agents scanning the destruction
                caused by the creatures.
          
                                    ALINE
                          I don't think I want to know your
                          definition of out of the ordinary.

                The Lab is full of sleek, high-tech lab equipment and state
                of the art computers. The room is lit with a HUMMING
                fluorescent light. Surgical equipment and various pieces of
                high-tech machinery BUZZ by an autopsy slab. Surgical tools
                are laid out on a table.
          
                Pinkerton's body is laid out on the slab, face-down.
          
                Fischer stands over Pinkerton's body. He holds a high-tech
                hand-held scanning device. The scanner is connected to a
                large monitor on a dolly next to the slab.
          
                Fischer holds the scanner a few inches above Pinkerton's
                body, passing it along the length of him.
          
                The image on the monitor matches the movements of the
                scanner. It shows a real-time internal scan of Pinkerton's
                body, displaying the skeleton, internal organs, and so on.
          
                Visible on the monitor is a spinal worm curled up tight
                around Pinkerton's spine.
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          Fischer doesn't look up, but his tone suddenly changes.
          
                              FISCHER
                    You shouldn't be here, Carnby.
          
          Carnby stands in the doorway. He waves Burke's I-D card.
          
                              CARNBY
                    I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now
                    what the hell is that thing inside him?
          
                              FISCHER
                    Your curiosity have anything to do with
                    the fingerprint of yours I found on his
                    corpse?
          
                              CARNBY
                    The list of people I trust is short,
                    Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?
          
          Fischer turns back to Pinkerton's body. Carnby comes up and
          stands next to him.
          
          Fischer takes a scalpel off the table and makes a careful
          incision along Pinkerton's back.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Have you I-D'd him?
          
                              FISCHER
                    Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James
                    Pinkerton. He's ex-713.
          
                              CARNBY
                    He was an agent? When?
          
          Using tongs, Fischer peels back the skin of Pinkerton's back.
          The spinal-worm is attached to Pinkerton's spine.
          
                              FISCHER
                    Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead.
                    I'm trying to get more intell, but his
                    records are so classified, they're
                    practically invisible.
          C
           arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open the skin.
          Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel,
          disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton's spine.
          
                              CARNBY
                    It's fused with his nervous system.

                                   FISCHER
                         I've never seen this kind of symbiosis
                         before.
          
               Fischer pulls the spinal-worm out of Pinkerton's open back
               with a pair of tongs. It hangs limply, motionless.
          
               The spinal-worm is long and thick, covered with hard, dark
               scales. It has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were connected
               to Pinkerton's spine.
          
                ischer drops the spinal-worm in a tub.
          
                ischer notices the hand-held scanning device is BEEPING
               faintly, still registering something. He looks at the read-
               out, curious, then concerned.
          
                                   FISCHER (CONT'D)
                         Scanner's still reading something...
          
               Fischer runs the scanner over Pinkerton's corpse. Nothing.
          
               Now Fischer looks even more concerned. He turns the scanner
               on himself, running it up and down his torso. Nothing.
          
               Fischer looks at Carnby. Carnby gets it. It might be him.
          
               Fischer runs the scanner over Carnby's torso. The scanner
               immediately starts BEEPING louder.
          
               They exchange a look between them. Something's inside Carnby.

                    excitement. Are you alright?
          
                              ALINE

                    This is a major find. I'll need to
                    analyze it. Confirm its authenticity.

                    I can do that myself.

          Hudgens stands up to his full height, suddenly menacing.

                Aline hits COPY on her computer and it burns a CD of the
                information she has processed.
          
                Aline searches through a roll of maps. She pulls out a map of
                North America and lays it out on a work station.
          
                Aline draws lines across the map, trying to pinpoint a
                location based on the constellations. She marks the map up
                with latitude and longitude calculations.
          
                She stops. She looks back up at the computer screen. She taps
                her pen on the map. She looks frustrated.

          Fischer takes a hand-held para-meter scanning device off a

                Fischer takes out several magazines of ammo out of the
                cabinet. He discharges a bullet. It glows yellow in his hand.

                Warily, Carnby holds out the hand-held scanner, checking to

                coat and lets it drop on the floor.
          
                He drops the duffle-bag on the floor. He kicks off his boots.

                Hudgens walks through a dank cement room. Various pieces of
                scientific equipment sit in a corner. Shelves are lined with
                ancient artifacts, small sculptures, and masks.
          
                Hudgens stops at a work station and pauses. A look of pain
                crosses his face. He winces, holding it in. He steadies
                himself.
          
                At the other side of the Lab is a large recess in the space.
                The opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold.
                The cage appears to be empty.
          
                But suddenly, an invisible creature SLAMS into the bars of
                the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens.
          
                As it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it,
                making it visible for a split second.
          
                Hudgens watches calmly. He goes to a small dial built into
                the wall beside the cage. Hudgens turns up the dial.
          
                In the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the
                invisible creature. It SQUEALS and HISSES from the
                electricity.

                Hudgens turns the dial back down.
          
                Hudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to
                the cage.
          
                He injects the syringe into the creature's neck, between two
                of its scales. He withdraws a syringe-full of the creature's
                black, sticky blood.
          
                He goes back to the work station, rolling up the sleeve of
                his shirt. His arm is pocked with injection marks.
          
                Hudgens ties off his arm, preps a vein, and injects himself
                with the syringe of creature's blood. He closes his eyes,
                feeling the substance flow into him.

               along his back.
          
               Aline lays her head on a pillow. Their faces lie close
               together. She watches Carnby sleep.
          
               Aline leans over and gives Carnby the lightest of kisses. He
               doesn't wake up.

               Aline's eyes flutter closed, then open, then closed again.
               Within seconds, she's asleep.

               The Kitchen is comfortable, lived in. Fischer's suit jacket
               hangs on the back of a chair. His revolver and holster also
               hang on the chair.
          
               Fischer's wife, SARAH FISCHER (early 50s) stirs the contents
               of a pot with a wooden spoon. Fischer makes a salad.
          
                                   FISCHER
                         What else could I do? I had to tell him.
          
                                   SARAH FISCHER
                         You did the right thing, Paul. From what
                         you've told me, Carnby can take care of
                         himself.

               Sarah hands Fischer the wooden spoon. She gives him a quick,
               warm kiss. She exits the room.

               Sarah Fischer hurries to the front door.
          
               She checks her appearance in a mirror in the Foyer. She
               touches her hair, purses her lips, and turns to the door.
          
               She opens the front door, a pleasant expression on her face.

               The lights in the Kitchen start to flicker. Fischer freezes,
               listening. The House is quiet.
          
               Fischer dives for the revolver hanging in his holster on the
               chair. He pulls a container of glowing bullets out of the
               pocket of his jacket.
          
               The container spills on the floor. He scrambles to pick up
               the bullets and load them into the revolver.
          
               Fischer edges to the Kitchen door, listening, anxious.
               Everything is quiet.
          
               He quietly pushes open the door, revolver ready.

               Fischer creeps into the Foyer. The lights flicker.
          
               No one is in the Foyer. The front door is open.

               Fischer quietly opens the door to the Living Room, gripping
               his revolver tightly. He steps into the room.
          
               The lights in the Living Room are out. A broken lamp lies
               SMASHED on its side.
          
               Fischer comes around the side of the couch. He stops,
               shocked.
          
               Sarah Fischer's dead body lies in a pool of blood.
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)
          
          
          
          
          Fischer is suddenly grabbed and SLAMMED into the wall. The
          impact knocks several framed photos of Fischer and his Wife
          off the wall. They SHATTER as they hit the floor.
          
          Fischer is PUNCHED in the face, hard. He is stunned.
          
          Fischer is hurled over the couch. He lands heavily on a glass
          coffee table, SHATTERING the glass tabletop.
          
          The impact knocks his revolver out of his hands.
          
          Fischer lies dazed in the broken glass. He looks up at his
          attacker.
          
          It's Hudgens, standing over him.
          
          Hudgens SLAMS his fist into Fischer's face. Fischer is now
          only semi-conscious.
          
          Hudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal-worm. Its many clawed
          feet and razor-sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled
          body writhing in his grip.
          
                              HUDGENS
                    If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.
          
          Hudgens grabs Fischer by his hair and pulls his head back,
          forcing his mouth open.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          We follow the spinal-worm as it enters Fischer's mouth,
          slipping down his throat.
          
          We continue to follow the spinal-worm as it makes its way
          through Fischer's body, weaving through the twists and turns
          of his digestive system and internal organs.
          
          The spinal-worm tears through layers of Fischer's insides,
          finally making its way to his spine. The spinal-worm then
          wraps itself around Fischer's spine, its tiny clawed feet
          grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length.
          
          We move up Fischer's spinal cord to his brain. The spinal-
          worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts.
          We travel through Fischer's brain and out of his eyes.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          Fischer's expression is now calm. Hudgens regards Fischer,
          looking pleased with himself.

                Young Edward enters the Shed, closing the door behind him.
          
                The small Shed is cluttered with equipment for repairing
                power lines. A large transformer module sits at the back of
                the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity.
          
                Something compels Young Edward to move closer towards the
                transformer and reach out a trembling hand. He places his
                hand against the transformer's front grill.
          
                With a sudden SNAP and FLASH, electricity courses through
                Young Edward. Jagged fingers of blue light jolt around him.

                It's night. The Loft is dark. Carnby and Aline are fast
                asleep on the bed, lying next to one another.
          
                Carnby wakes up with a start. He tries to get his bearings.
                Carnby looks surprised to see Aline lying next to him.
          
                He quietly gets out of bed, letting her sleep. He pulls on a
                fresh shirt.
          
                Carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light.
                He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station.
          
                Carnby unwraps the items. They are the three Abkani artifacts
                from the Museum.
          
                Carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around.
                Something catches his eye. Carnby fiddles with the artifact.
          
                Suddenly, the artifact telescopes out. Instead of one thick
                ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled
                on the other, with a common hollow middle.

                Carnby picks up the large ring artifact. He slots it into
                place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact. Next, Carnby slots
                in the medium and small rings into place.
          
                The four pieces fit together perfectly, creating a
                cylindrical device with a small, round opening in the bottom.

                Carnby cooks omelettes in the Kitchen area of the Loft. The
                ingredients are spread out on the counter.
          
                Aline wakes up. She sits up in the bed and looks around.

                          Something smells amazing.
          
                Aline trots over to the Kitchen area as Carnby serves up the
                omelettes. Aline gives him a look.
          
                                    ALINE (CONT'D)
                          I love omelettes.

                          I know.
          
                Carnby sits down across from Aline. They eat while they talk.
          
                                    ALINE
                          I figured out a connection with the
                          symbols on those artifacts. They
                          correspond to constellations. But
                          something's missing.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          Maybe this will help...
          
                Carnby takes out the assembled Abkani device and puts it down
                on the table between them.
          
                Aline picks up the device, fascinated. She runs her fingers
                over the Abkani symbols carved into the lynchpin artifact.
          
                She goes to her bag and pulls out the map she was working on
                and the CD. She hands Carnby the CD.
          
                                    ALINE
                          Can you run the program on this?
          
                Carnby goes over to his computer and inserts the CD.
          
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                Aline spreads out the map. She draws lines across it,
                connecting up constellations with locations on the map. She
                writes out latitude and longitude calculations.
          
                Aline comes up to Carnby at the computer. The program is
                waiting for her calculations.
          
                She leans past Carnby and enters the latitude and longitude
                numbers into the program. The computer processes the
                information. Hundreds of map images flash across the screen
                as the computer searches for a match.

                          What are we looking for?

                          The Abkani used constellations to pin-
                          point a geographical location. But I
                          don't think I can isolate it closer than
                          a hundred mile radius.
          
                The computer finds a match. A specific map appears onscreen,
                with a 100 mile radius circle marked in the center of it.

                          Yeah. That's us right there.
          
                Carnby points to a spot on the onscreen map.
          
                 SCENE 126 OMITTED 
          
                INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
          127                                                                     127
                Carnby puts the dishes from their meal into the Kitchen sink.
                The sink tap is RUNNING. Aline clears the dishes.
          
          
          
          
                                                                      (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          
          The para-meter Fischer gave Carnby starts faintly BEEPING,
          but the RUNNING sink tap covers the sound. Something is
          coming.
          
          The lights in the Loft flicker once.
          
          Carnby turns off the tap and they listen intently. They can
          hear the scanner BEEPING faintly.
          
          The lights in the Loft flicker and go out.
          
          Aline grabs the flashlight and switches it on.
          
          Carnby runs to his revolver and holster. He checks the
          chamber in his revolver. The bullets glow.
          
          Carnby looks up, sensing something. He spins around, ready.
          
          A FIGURE stands behind him. It is John.
          
          John looks fierce, his face drawn, gaunt. His eyes are sunken
          into dark recesses, with nearly clear irises.
          
                              CARNBY
                    John?
          
          John lunges at Carnby. Carnby is too surprised to defend
          himself. John SLAMS Carnby against the wall, knocking his
          revolver out of his hands.
          
          John picks Carnby up and hurls him across the Loft. Carnby
          CRASHES through furniture as he lands heavily.
          
          Out of the shadows behind Aline, two FIGURES emerge. They are
          both missing ORPHANS, one MALE, one FEMALE. They have the
          same gaunt faces and clear irises as John.
          
          Carnby picks himself up. He spots the Orphans behind Aline.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    Behind you!
          
          The two Orphans lunge at Aline, but she's able to dodge out
          of the way. The Orphans are fast and fierce. Aline leaps
          forward, sliding across the floor towards Carnby's revolver.
          
          She grabs it and spins to face the two Orphans. They're gone.
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                    61.
          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          
          But then the Female Orphan leaps out at her. Aline FIRES,
          hitting the Female Orphan in the shoulder.
          
          The Female Orphans jumps away, into the shadows. Aline
          scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. But the Female
          Orphans has disappeared.
          
          Aline runs over to Carnby. He grabs a shotgun from the
          weapons cabinet and loads it.
          
                              ALINE
                    That looked like John.
          
                              CARNBY
                    It is. The other two are from the
                    orphanage as well.
          
          Carnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into
          the darkness of the Loft. They listen.
          
          Suddenly, John lunges at him, his teeth bared.
          
          Carnby SMASHES John across the head with the shotgun. But
          John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby
          breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John
          skitters off into the shadows.
          
          The Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her
          with her teeth.
          
          Carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for
          Aline.
          
          The Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male
          Orphan across the face with the pipe.
          
          Aline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see
          John rising up behind her, about to strike.
          C
           arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the
          chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.
          
          The Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct,
          Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him.
          The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies.
          
          Aline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan
          lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in
          the chest.
          
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (3)
          
          
          But it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female
          Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. The
          Female Orphan falls back, dead.
          
          Aline comes up to Carnby. He stands over John's corpse.
          
                              ALINE
                    You had no choice.
          
                              CARNBY
                    Something's controlling them.
          
                              ALINE
                    How many are there altogether?
          
                              CARNBY
                    Twenty. Including me.
          
          The para-meter starts BEEPING again, louder and more
          frenetic. The lights start to flicker, fading up and down.
          
          Carnby unzips the duffle-bag. It's full of 713 equipment
          given to him by Fischer. Carnby loads an assault rifle with
          713 magazines. He loads a pistol with the glowing bullets.
          
          Carnby throws Aline the pistol. She catches it in mid-air.
          She checks it like a pro.
          
          Aline and Carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready.
          
          There's a moment of quiet. They listen.
          
          The lights in the Loft flicker. The scanner BEEPS.
          
          Something SMASHES into the Loft's front door.
          
          Carnby grabs the para-meter. It BEEPS more insistently.
          
          The front door BURSTS open, knocked right off its hinges by
          the invisible creature crashing through it.
          
          P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
          The invisible xenomorph creature's skewed, inhuman P.O.V. as
          it looks across the Loft, searching. It locates Carnby and
          Aline and heads directly for them.
          A
           ll that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture
          being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them.
          
          The creature SMASHES right through a glass-topped work table,
          SHATTERING it. Papers whirl around in its wake.
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

          Aline and Carnby stand their ground, facing the on-coming
          creature as it lunges towards them.
          
          Carnby and Aline leap out of the way at the last moment.
          Rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously OPEN
          FIRE. Their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on.
          
          The creature SQUEALS, flashing visible from the multiple
          impacts. Their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it
          tumbles to the ground, dead.
          
          The creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. Broken
          furniture and shattered glass is everywhere.
          
          Carnby's para-meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the
          creature's death. The lights stop flickering.
          
                              CARNBY (CONT'D)
                    We'd better get out of here.
          
          Suddenly, all the lights in the Loft go out in unison. All
          the computer monitors also go dark.
          
          The scanner starts BEEPING frenetically. Electromagnetic
          readings shoot up, registering multiple sources nearby.
          
          Carnby and Aline back up together, ready for an attack.
          
          
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

               But the first thing they hear isn't a creature. It's the
               sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
          
               Streaks of glowing bullets fly through the air.
          
               It is a 713 unit, laying down suppressing FIRE as the Agents
               enter the Loft through the broken front door.
          
               Agents Barr, Cheung, and Marko enter, followed by five other
               AGENTS. They all wear full 713 combat gear, their rifle-
               mounted lamps illuminated, their weapons in use.

               The Agents FIRE glowing bullets through the dark Loft. There
               are invisible creatures everywhere.
          
                                   AGENT BARR (INTO COMM-LINK)
                         Roger that. We're hot.
          
               The muzzle FLASHES and glowing bullets pierce the darkness of
               the Loft.
          
                hadows swim through the space as the invisible creatures
               move around them, attacking the Agents with their razor-sharp
               claws and spiked-tails.
          
               P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
               An invisible creature swoops out of the shadows towards an
               Agent, who is FIRING in the opposite direction. The creature
               whips past the Agent, slicing him open with a fluid slash of
               its claws. The creature keeps moving directly for Carnby.
          
               Carnby and Aline, standing together, FIRE their weapons in
               the darkness, oblivious to the creature rushing towards them.
          
          
          
          
                                                                   (CONTINUED)
          
          
          
          But at the last second, Carnby turns instinctively as the
          creature lunges at him.
          
                               CARNBY
                    Aline!
          
          Carnby and Aline turn and OPEN FIRE on the creature. It
          flashes visible from multiple hits, flailing off into the
          darkness.
          
          Agent Barr FIRES controlled bursts of glowing bullets into
          the dark Loft. He screams into his comm-link.
          
                              AGENT BARR (INTO COMM-LINK)

          The sound of a HELICOPTER can be heard outside the Loft.
          
          P.O.V. CREATURE:
          
          Another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall,
          avoiding the GUNFIRE. It locates its target, an Agent FIRING
          up at the ceiling. It races towards the Agent.
          
          The Agent turns to the attack and tries to fire. But the
          creature is too fast. It SLAMS the Agent back against the
          wall and impales him with its spiked-tail.
          
          Agents Barr and Cheung spot this and OPEN FIRE on the
          creature. It flails about, fading visible from the impacts.
          
          The creature tries to scurry away, but Barr and Cheung are on
          it. With precision and speed, they blow the creature away.
          
          But more creatures attack. The fighting is fierce. Glowing
          bullets streak through the darkness. The Agents are calm and
          determined as they engage the creatures.
          
          Carnby and Aline hold their own, sticking together, SHOOTING
          at whatever shadows move around them.
          
          Six AGENTS in full combat gear burst into the Loft. Leading
          the unit is Commander Burke. Agent Miles is with him, as is
          AGENT TURNER (mid-30s).
          
          Burke, Miles, Turner, and the other Agents immediately join
          the battle, laying down suppressing FIRE.

          An Agent carrying a rifle-mounted grenade-launcher FIRES an
          incendiary flash-grenade at the Upper Level of the Loft.
          With a flash of blinding light, the grenade EXPLODES.
          Creatures SQUEAL as flames swoop up through the Upper Level.
          
          Glowing bullets fill the dark Loft. Creatures SQUEAL and
          flail from the hits.
          
          In the darkness of the Loft, Carnby, Aline, and the Agents
          finish off the remaining invisible creatures.
          
          The last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. The
          Agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead.
          
          Agent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them. Barr
          clearly respects Carnby's abilities.
          
          The Loft is still dark. Barr's rifle-mounted scanner no
          longer registers any creatures.
          
                              AGENT BARR
                    We're clear, sir.
          
          Burke looks around at the remains of the battle. The Loft is
          totally trashed. A small fire burns in the Upper Level.
          
                               BURKE
                    Love what you've done with the place,
                    Carnby.
          
          Miles runs a hand-held scanning device over John's corpse.
          The scanner BEEPS, indicating the presence of a spinal-worm.
          
                              AGENT MILES
                    Sir, this one's infected too!
          
          Agent Turner scans the Female Orphan's corpse. His scanning
          device BEEPS. She has a spinal-worm too.
          
                              AGENT TURNER
                    Got another one here!
          
          Burke immediately turns his weapon to Carnby. The red laser-
          sight makes a glowing dot on Carnby's chest.
          
          Taking their cue from Burke, the other Agents in his unit all
          train their weapons on Carnby. Several glowing red dots
          hover on his chest.
          
                              BURKE
                    Drop your weapon and get down on the
                    ground.
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                              ALINE
                    What are you doing?
          
                              BURKE
                    He's been infected with some kind of
                    organism. He could be under its control.
          
          Aline turns to Carnby.
          
                              CARNBY
                    It's true. I've got one inside me. But
                    it's not controlling me.
          
                              BURKE
                    You'll excuse me if I don't take your
                    word for it. Now drop your weapon.
          
          Carnby holds his weapon at his side. He doesn't drop it. But
          he doesn't move either.
          
          Aline steps in between Carnby and the Agents. The red dots
          are now trained on her chest.
          
                              AGENT TURNER
                    Get out of the way!
          
          The Agents try to get a clear shot around Aline.
          
                              ALINE
                    He's not one of them.
          
                               URKE
                    If I've got to shoot through you to get
                    to him, I'll do it.
          
          Carnby looks up at the lights. They are still dark.
          
                              CARNBY
                    Why are the lights still out?
          
          Barr consults his scanner. It isn't registering anything.
          
                              AGENT BARR
                    Scanner's clear.

                              BURKE
                    Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby?
          
          An Agent standing at the other end of the Loft hears
          something SHUFFLING behind him. He turns to look.
          
          Something grabs the Agent, SLAMS him back against the wall,
          and rips out his neck.
          
          It's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and
          clear irises.
          
          Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure
          out what's happening.
          
          Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke.
          Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES.
          
          Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead
          center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The
          Orphan was about to pounce on Burke.
          
          There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another.
          Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life.
          
          The ORPHANS attack.
          
          They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage. Like
          Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast,
          and deadly. They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with
          sunken eyes and nearly clear irises.
          
          The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce. They
          bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw
          around the Agents and tear them apart.
          
          The dark Loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking
          through the darkness. The Agents' rifle-mounted lamps shine
          around, but the effect is chaotic, disorienting.
          
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: (5)
          
          
          As the Orphans attack, they make quick work of many of the
          Agents. Glowing bullets fly around everywhere. The SCREAMS of
          Agents being torn apart mix with BURSTS of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
          
          Carnby and Aline stay together, dodging the attacking
          Orphans, and FIRING into the darkness.
          
          An Orphan rises up behind Carnby. He spins and SHOOTS her in
          the side. But she just keep coming. Carnby SHOOTS the Orphan
          again, this time dead center in the chest. The Orphan
          collapses, dead.
          
          Carnby checks the corpse. The bullet came out the other side.
          A mixture of red blood and black, sticky ooze drips from a
          bullet hole right over the Orphan's spine.
          
          Carnby grabs the comm-link off the body of a dead Agent.
          
                              CARNBY (INTO COMM-LINK)
                    All Agents! You've got to kill the
                    organism to stop them! Aim for the spine!
          
           cross the Loft, Burke listens to the comm-link.
          
          An Orphan is attacking Agent Miles. Burke takes careful aim
          and SHOOTS the Orphan in the back, right on the spine. The
          Orphan falls over, dead.
          
                              BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK)
                    Confirmed. Spinal shot's a kill shot.
          
          With this information, the Agents quickly gain the upper-hand
          against the Orphans' attack. The Orphans are fast and deadly,
          but they have no organization. Now that the Agents have a
          handle on this new threat, their precision and speed returns.
          
          Soon, the battle is over. Dozens of bodies of dead Agents and
          dead Orphans lie littered around Carnby's destroyed Loft.
          
          Only Carnby, Aline, Burke, Miles, Barr, Cheung, Marko, and
          Turner remain alive.
          
          Burke's and Carnby's eyes meet. Burke approaches Carnby.
          
          The other Agents all stand by, waiting for an order from
          Burke. Aline watches them, ready to step in.

                    Fischer's missing. So is Hudgens. And
                    I've got a situation brewing that makes
                    this scrap look like a bar brawl.

                    What does Hudgens have to do with this?

                    you both to brief me in the air.
          
          Burke turns to walk off, but then stops. He turns back to
          Carnby. Burke holds out his hand.
          
                              BURKE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, and Carnby... I'll need my I-D back.
          
          Carnby smirks. He pulls out Burke's I-D card and hands it
          back to him.

                A massive, long-abandoned structure built directly against
                the face of a mountain. This is the Entrance Hall of
                Britannia Mine.
          
                713 AGENTS mill about, setting up perimeter defenses. Humvees
                are being positioned as barricades. Large spotlights are
                being set up to illuminate the area, with power cables
                leading inside the Entrance Hall.
          
                Agents Barr, Cheung, and Marko are part of the team outside,
                setting up the defenses.
          
                The 713 helicopter carrying Carnby, Aline, Commander Burke,
                and Agents Miles comes down for a landing next to two other
                helicopters already sitting in front of the Mine.
          
                The moment the helicopter touches down, Burke leaps out,
                barking into his comm-link. Carnby, Aline, and Miles exit
                after him.

                Rusty construction vehicles, detritus, and rubble lie

                AGENTS scurry around, setting up the defense system. The main
                position is set up just inside the entrance to the Hall.
          
                Burke and Miles enter, followed by Aline and Carnby.

                             every available agent in the vicinity is
                             here. But Commander...

                             I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it
                             before sunrise.
          
                Several raised Platforms stand in the middle of the Hall.
          
                On one Platform, Agent Turner helps two AGENTS unload a large
                gold-plated generator from the back of a Humvee.
          
                                       AGENT TURNER
                             Generator will be on-line shortly, sir.
          
                Burke nods to Turner as he and the others walk by. Carnby and
                Aline get into step with Burke and Miles.

                             We are. The highest xeno concentration on
                             record is closing in on this location.
                             This could be our chance to wipe them out
                             once and for all.
          
                A Tunnel, carved directly into the rock wall of the Mine,
                leads off into darkness. Carnby stares down at the Tunnel.

                           They're coming here for a reason. Until
                           we know what they're after, we're never
                           really going to be able to stop them.
          
                Agent Miles consults his hand-held para-meter.
          
                                     AGENT MILES
                           Something's definitely down there, sir.
                           But there's too much interference to get
                           a clear reading from here.
          
                Miles looks at Burke expectantly. Carnby and Aline watch him
                as well. Burke looks conflicted.
          
                                     BURKE
                           Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of
                           perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out
                           until we find out what's down there.

                Batteries of flash-mines (mines that explode with a burst of
                blinding light) set to electromagnetic sensors are being
                positioned in wide perimeters around the Entrance Hall.
          
                Automatic gatling guns loaded with chains of glowing bullets
                are set up at key points around the area. The gatling guns
                are mounted on swiveling robotic bases, able to automatically
                turn to face on-coming targets.
          
                AGENT FEENSTRA (mid-30s) tests the motion sensor on one of
                the gatling guns with her hand. The gun swivels accurately to
                match the movement of her hand.
          
                Agent Feenstra nods to the two AGENTS standing behind the
                gatling gun. They tinker with its guidance system.

                Along with them are Commander Burke, and Agents Barr, Cheung

                Agent Barr carries a hand-held para-meter. It's picking up
                high electromagnetic readings.
          
                                    AGENT BARR
                          It's definitely this way, sir.
          
                They pass by various pieces of mining equipment, long since
                discarded. Thick dust and cobwebs hang off the equipment.
          
                They make their way down the Tunnel.

                The Tunnel ends at a slightly larger, rounded Chamber with
                walls of solid rock. They can't go any further. Cobwebs and
                thick dust hang everywhere.
          
                Carnby, Aline, Burke, Barr, Cheung, and Marko emerge out of
                the Tunnel into the Chamber.

                Carnby looks around, sensing something. He wipes away some
                cobwebs and dust and runs his hand over the Chamber walls.

               Aline approaches the spot where Carnby stands. She shines her
               flashlight beam in the wiped off area. Faint Abkani symbols
               are carved into the wall.

                            They're Abkani.
          
               The Agents all start wiping away the cobwebs and dust,
               examining the walls for more symbols. They all shine their
               beams of light through the dark space, searching.
          
               Cheung finds more Abkani symbols on another wall.

                            There's more over here.
          
               As Agent Marko moves through the space with his lamp, his
               boot hits a small protrusion in the dusty ground. Agent Marko
               shines his lamp down on ground. With his boot, he pushes away
               the dust on the ground. There's a carving on the floor.
          
               Agent Barr spots Marko and shines his lamp towards him.

               Agent Marko presses down on the carving with his boot.
          
               Suddenly, the stone floor beneath Agent Marko crumbles away,
               revealing a deep circular Shaft.
          
               Agent Marko can't hold on and he falls into the Shaft. He
               SCREAMS as he falls.

               The Shaft drops down sixty feet. Marko falls, unable to stop
               his descent.
          
               The Shaft walls are rough-hewn rock. Small fingers of lichen
               grow out of the cracks in the stone. An ancient, fragile
               wooden ladder is imbedded directly into the rock wall, its
               rungs made of thick, knotted old branches.

                The Shaft drops into a round, sand-covered room. Razor-sharp
                spikes poke out of the loose sand beneath the Shaft.
          
                Agent Marko falls directly onto the spikes. He is impaled on

                Agent Miles runs up to Agent Turner. He is still tinkering
                with the generator. The spotlights are still off.

                Burke, and Agents Barr and Cheung lower themselves down the
                Shaft on zip-lines. They descend quickly and smoothly.
          
                Carnby and Aline have to take the long way down. They
                carefully climb down the rungs of the ancient wooden ladder
                built into the Shaft.
          
                Carnby steps down on a weak rung and it starts to give way.
                When Aline steps down on it moments later, it breaks.

                Small rock fragments shower down into the open mouth of the
                Shaft. There's a CREAKING sound.
          
                The collapsed floor has triggered a trap.
          
                In the ceiling directly above the Shaft, a heavy, round stone
                column suddenly breaks loose. More rock fragments rain down
                into the Shaft.

                The stone column drops into the Shaft with a thunderous
                CRASH. It fits perfectly.
          
                The column starts sliding down the Shaft towards them.

                The friction from the Shaft walls is the only thing slowing
                the stone column's relentless descent down the Shaft.
          
                The weight of the column crumples the ladder as it falls.
          
                As Carnby and Aline try to climb down the ladder, it is
                getting more and more rickety and unsteady.
          
                Burke and Barr are almost at the bottom of the Shaft.
          
                Cheung is having problems with her zip-line. It keeps
                jamming, slowing her descent.

                The stone column is almost at Aline and Carnby. The ladder is
                being ripped apart by the column. They are out of time.
          
                Carnby grabs hold of Burke's and Barr's zip-lines, which now
                hang loose down the Shaft.

                Carnby and Aline slide past Agent Cheung. She is still

                Carnby and Aline drop down out of the Shaft. Carnby lets go
                of the zip-lines and they fall to the sand by the spikes,
                rolling to safety.

                Agent Miles and the other Agents in the Hall continue to FIRE
                away into the night.

                          Ammo running low! How many of these
                          goddamn things are there?
          
                Agent Miles' scanner registers that waves of the creatures
                are still quickly approaching them.

                Cheung tests her injured ankle. She can walk with a limp.
          
                Something moves through the sand towards Aline. Carnby looks
                over at the last moment.
          
                                    CARNBY
                          Aline!
          
                With a loud SQUEAL, a SAND WORM bursts out of the sand in
                front of Aline. At the end of its elongated body, a pair of
                snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor-sharp teeth.
          
                Aline scrambles back and falls down. Her rifle is out of
                reach.
          
                Another sand worm bursts out of the sand, diving for Carnby.
                But he is quick on the draw. He SHOOTS the sand worm before
                it can bite him. The bullets BLOW APART the sand worm's head.
          
                The sand on the Chamber floor comes alive with movement as
                sand worms burrow towards them.
          
                Agents Barr and Cheung OPEN FIRE on the sand worms.
                Aline fumbles for her flashlight, shining it at the sand
                worm. It recoils from the light and HISSES at her. The sand
                worm's jaws fold open, revealing its razor-sharp teeth.
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

               CONTINUED:
          
          
               The sand worm tries to dodge the light. It snaps at Aline
               with its jaws and lunges at her.
          
               She grabs it by the torso, just under the snapping jaws. The
               sand worm struggles, trying to bite Aline. She can barely
               hold it away from her. Her grip starts to loosen.
          
               The sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at Aline's face. She
               strains to hold it away.
          
               With the sound of a GUNSHOT, the sand worm's head explodes.
               It flops to one side, dead.
          
               Carnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot.
          
               A sand worm bursts out and chomps down on Cheung's bad foot.
               She SCREAMS.
          
               Barr SHOOTS the worm that bit Cheung. Cheung falls back, her
               body seizing up from its poisonous bite.
          
               Cheung's body contorts. Barr grabs her as Cheung's head reels
               back and her body goes limp. She's dead.
          
               Burke turns, his face grim. He OPENS FIRE on the sand worms.
               With precision and intensity, he FIRES controlled bursts at
               any movement under the sand.
          
               Carnby FIRES along with him. After a few seconds, the
               movement has stopped.
          
               Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand together. They look down
               at Cheung's body.
          
               Over the comm-link, Burke can hear the sounds of the BATTLE
               going on up above them.

               The Agents FIRE streaks of glowing bullets into the night.
               Flash-mines EXPLODE close by.
          
               A creature leaps out at Agent Miles. He spins and opens FIRE.
               The creature flashes visible as Miles riddles it with
               bullets. The creature flails around, dying.
          
               Creatures start leaping out at the Agents, jumping over the
               Humvee barricades and slashing at Agents with their claws.
               The Agents STRAFE every creature they see.

                A creature jumps on an Agent's back and tears at him. Another
                creature pounces on an Agent, ripping him open.
          
                Dozens of creatures stream into the Hall. The Agents lay down
                steady streams of fire, their glowing bullets streaking
                through the night.

                 parks fly out around the generator as Agent Turner holds an
                electrical torch to a component. Sweat drips from his
                forehead. He wipes his eyes clear as he works.
          
                Agent Turner tests to see that his electrical work is secure.
                An Agent stand with him, ready to switch on the generator.

                The creatures HISS and recoil from the spotlight beams. Some
                begin smoldering under the glare.
          
                Creatures take cover in the shadows behind old pieces of
                mining equipment. Most race away from the light into the
                darkness outside the Mine.

                Fischer appears at the end of the Platform.
          
                Fischer approaches Agent Turner and the other Agent standing
                at the generator. His demeanor is now totally different. He
                is cold, menacing.
                A
                 gent Turner turns to see Fischer approaching.
          
                                     AGENT TURNER
                          Fischer?
          
                In a quick motion, Fischer grabs Agent Turner by the throat
                and hurls him out of the way.
          
                The other Agent FIRES on Fischer with her weapon. Fischer
                takes a bullet in the shoulder. It doesn't stop him.
          
                Fischer lunges for the Agent. He knocks her back and grabs
                her face. Fischer snaps the Agent's neck, killing her.
          
                Agent Turner runs towards Fischer, FIRING a sustained BURST
                of automatic GUNFIRE. Agent Turner's bullets rip into him,
                but Fischer keep coming.
          
                Fischer lunges at Turner, grabbing him and SLAMMING him
                against the generator. Fischer SMASHES Turner in the face,
                almost knocking him out.
          
                Fischer tears open Turner's combat vest. Four grenades hang
                from the vest.
          
                 ne by one, Fischer pulls the pins out of the four grenades.
          
                Turner starts to regain consciousness just in time to see
                this. His eyes go wide in fear.
          
                Fischer hold Turner against the generator. Fischer is too
                strong for Turner to get away.

                Burke stops at a dark recess carved into the Sand Chamber.
                The recess is thick with cobwebs and dust.
          
                Burke cleans the cobwebs away. He stops, surprised at what he
                sees in the recess behind the cobwebs.

                 gents Miles, Agent Feenstra, and two other AGENTS, are
                barricaded behind pieces of mining machinery. They SHOOT
                streams of glowing bullets across the dark Entrance Hall.
          
                Suddenly, an invisible creature grabs the first Agent from
                behind a rusty piece of machinery. The creature throws the
                Agent into the air. He lands heavily, stunned.
          
                Before the Agent can get to his feet, three invisible
                creatures pounce, tearing him to shreds.
          
                 rom behind his position, Miles SHOOTS at the creatures with
                glowing bullets, scattering them.
          
                The second Agent stands behind a piece of machinery, tense,
                rifle ready. She hears a WHOOSH of movement nearby. She
                turns, but can't see anything.
          
                She hears a SHUFFLING sound above her. She looks up. The
                creature is above her, on top of the machinery.
          
                The Agent tries to SHOOT, but the creature's tail SNAPS at
                her, impaling her with its tail-spike.
          
                Agent Miles and Agent Feenstra SHOOT at the creature with
                precise BURSTS of glowing bullets.
          
          
                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                CONTINUED:
          
          
                The creature leaps at them. Miles and Feenstra hold their
                positions, RIDDLING the creature with glowing bullets.
          
                A creature leaps out at Feenstra. She hears the WHOOSH of
                movement at the last moment and swivels, FIRING in the
                direction of the creature.
          
                 ut she's SLAMMED off her feet. Feenstra gets a deep GASH in
                her thigh from the creature's spiked tail.
          
                                      AGENT MILES
                          Feenstra!
          
                The creature pounces. But Feenstra is fast enough. She BLOWS
                AWAY the creature with a BURST of glowing bullets.

                Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand in front of the dark
                recess in the Sand Chamber. The recess is completely sealed
                up by a solid concrete wall.
                A
                 line comes up to the concrete wall, running her hands along
                its flat surface. It is obviously not Abkani.

                Agent Miles and Agent Feenstra are barricaded behind an old
                mining vehicle. The bodies of dead Agents lie around them.
          
                Agent Feenstra bleeds from the wound in her thigh. The lights
                on their rifles are the only lights in the Hall.
          
                An invisible creature jumps out at them, knocking debris out
                of the way as it charges.

          Agent Miles rolls away at the last second as the creature
          SLAMS into the old mining vehicle.
          
          Agent Feenstra spins around and EMPTIES her last clip into
          the creature, killing it.
          
                                AGENT FEENSTRA
                    I'm out.
          
                                AGENT MILES
                    Last one.
          
          Miles throws Feenstra a magazine. Feenstra loads it in.
          
          Miles tries to get a signal on his comm-link. But it just
          gives out STATIC.
          
                              AGENT MILES (CONT'D)
                    Commander? Krash? Anyone?
          
          Agent Miles pulls off his comm-link.
          
                              AGENT FEENSTRA
                    I can't walk. If I lay down suppressing
                    fire, maybe you can make it out of here.
          
                              AGENT MILES
                    I die fighting or I don't die at all.
          
          Agent Miles OPENS FIRE into the night. His bullets glow as
          they streak through the air. Feenstra picks herself up and
          OPENS FIRE alongside him.
          
          Creatures SQUEAL in the distance as the bullets find their
          marks. Feenstra empties out her last magazine.
          
          An invisible creature leaps over the barricade and pounces on
          Feenstra, tearing into her.
          
          Miles SHOOTS at the creature, emptying his last magazine. But
          he's too late to save Feenstra. Her torn-up body slumps
          against their barricade
          
          Agent Miles is alone. He is out of ammunition. He pulls the
          trigger futilely. Miles stands firm. He flips up his visor.
          
          Miles closes his eyes. He is hoisted into the air by an
          invisible creature and thrown to the ground. Invisible
          creatures tear him apart.

                Carnby, Aline, Barr, and Burke take cover behind the stone
                column. Burke holds a remote detonator. It is active.
          
                Burke tries to get a signal on his comm-link. But all he gets
                is STATIC. Looking grim, Burke prepares to press the button
                on the detonator.
          
                                       ALINE

                Burke shrugs and presses the button. The detonator counts
                down: 3... 2... 1...
          
                A tremendous EXPLOSION rocks the Sand Chamber. Sand whirls
                through the air. Concrete fragments blow out from the recess.
          
                As the smoke clears, Carnby, Aline, Burke, and Barr approach
                the recess. The concrete wall has been blown open. Smoke
                rises up off the ruined wall.
          
                The Sand Chamber now opens up into another dark room.

                Carnby, Aline, Barr, and Burke step over the rubble of the
                concrete wall. They shine their lights around the dark room.
          
                They are in a large abandoned Bureau 713 Lab. Thick dust
                covers all surfaces. But it was once a high-tech facility.
          
                On one side of the Lab is a sliding metal door.

                             What is this place?
          
                Medical equipment, scientific instruments, and computers have
                been left as they were, untouched for two decades.
          
                A series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall. In each
                tube, a spinal-worm lies dead, floating in gelatinous liquid
          
                Aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to another
                wall. They are anatomical schematics for the spinal-worms.
                There are also diagrams of the human body with markings
                isolating key areas of the spinal cord.
          
                Carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass basins,
                each about the size of a child.
          
          
                                                                       (CONTINUED)

          Each basin has a small metal tag on it. Carnby wipes the
          layer of dust off one of the metal tags.
          
          The tag reads: E. CARNBY.

          mounted lamps. Barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors.

          Carnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors.
          
          Next to the hangar doors is a control panel. Barr pulls the
          front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank.
          
          Barr pulls on the hand-crank. It won't give. Carnby joins him
          and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank. The hand-
          crank CLANKS into the open position.
          
          An old mechanism is engaged. The hangar doors slide open,
          revealing another doorway behind them. But this one is
          clearly not part of the Lab.
          
          It is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani
          symbols. The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. It
          looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door.
          
          In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening.
          A
           line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door.
          One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT.

          Aline reaches into her pack and takes out the Abkani device.
          It is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door.
          The same DARK SPIRIT pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin.

          Blood spurts out as Barr collapses to the ground, dead.
          
          Hudgens stands behind them, carrying two pistols.

                    I'm afraid I can't allow that.
          
          Before they can react, Hudgens presses a pistol to Aline's
          throat. He points the other pistol at Burke and Carnby.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    Now drop your weapons and back away.
          
          Carnby and Burke drop their guns and step back. Carnby glares

                    It was 713.
          
                              HUDGENS
                    Our early work was crude, I admit. But                     
                    eventually we perfected the implant                        
                    process. You were our last failure,                        
                    Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never
                    would've shut down the experiments.                        
          Burke's eyes flash with anger.
          
                              BURKE                                            
                    There's no way this was sanctioned.

                    Before your kind took over, 713 had very                   
                    different... priorities. Now, you just                     
                    blaze in and destroy everything before we                  
                    can learn to control it. I've wasted                       
                    twenty years working in secret because of                  
                    short-sighted men like you.                                
          Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    There it is...                                             
          Aline's expression is firm, unafraid. She grips the device
          tightly. Hudgens is about to pull the trigger.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    You were a fine archeologist.

          Hudgens turns to Carnby, curious.
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                    Give him the key. Enough people have died
                    today.
          
          Aline sees Carnby is serious. She holds out the device to
          Hudgens.
          
                              HUDGENS
                    You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not
                    without this...
          
          Hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on
          the Erebus. He hands it to Aline.
          
          Aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at
          the bottom of the device, turning it into place. The device
          is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom.
          
          With one pistol pointed at Burke and Carnby and the other at
          Aline, Hudgens directs her to the gold door.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    Insert the key.
          A
           line inserts the device into the opening in the door.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    Now turn it.
          
          Aline rotates the device, using the flat protrusion on the
          bottom. It CLICKS into place.
          
          A small crack splinters away from the opening where the
          device sits. The crack splits off into several other cracks.
          
          Hudgens points his pistols at the others, but his attention
          is clearly directed at the gold door.
          
                              HUDGENS (CONT'D)
                    When we found the first of them, 713 saw                
                    just another threat to be eliminated. But
                    I knew it was something more. It was the                
                    first. The first to wake. I've woken                    
                    others since then. But the rest are
                    coming...
          
          As Hudgens speaks, Carnby, Burke, and Aline exchange a look
          between them. Carnby's eyes indicate the C-4 in Agent Barr's
          pack. Burke and Aline understand.

               The cracks splinter out, dividing, until they cover the
               entire door. In a rush of fragments, the cracked gold
               crumbles to the ground.
          
                he empty doorway now leads into darkness on the other side.

               Hudgens steps through the doorway.
          
               The doorway opens up into a vast Cave, hundreds of feet high
               and wide, stretching off into darkness. The cave walls are
               rough-hewn rock, untouched by human hands.
          
               The walls of the Cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds
               of tunnels, pocking the rock like a hive, leading off into
               the depths of the mountain.
          
               Hudgens moves into the Cave, tentative, but excited.
          
               Suddenly, there's a SCRATCHING, SCURRYING sound.
          
               A xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels.
          
               Out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph. And a third.
          
               Across the vast cave, dozens of xenomorphs creep out of
               individual tunnels.
          
               Hudgens steps further into the Cave. The xenomorphs approach
               him, their heads darting about.
          
               The xenomorphs surround Hudgens on all sides. His steps are
               careful. He reaches his hand out to one of the creatures.
               T
                he creature moves up to Hudgens' hand, smelling it.
          
               The creature lunges at him, ripping into him with its teeth.
          
               The other xenomorphs surrounding Hudgens pounce on him as
               well. The creatures tear Hudgens apart.
          
               Like a dam breaking, hundreds of xenomorphs start streaming
               out of the hive-like tunnel system of the Cave.
          
               Standing in the doorway, Aline sees the creatures coming.

                Carnby shoves the hand-crank into the closed position.
          
                The hangar doors in front of the Abkani doorway start to
                close. Aline backs away from the doorway.
          
                Aline OPENS FIRE with an assault rifle. The glowing bullets
                streak into the dark Cave, hitting several of the approaching
                creatures. But there are too many of them. They keep coming.
          
                The hangar doors are almost closed. The xenomorphs are only a
                few feet from the doorway.
          
                The hangar doors SLAM closed just in time.
          
                A heavy impact THUMPS against the other side of the hangar
                doors. Then another. The xenomorphs are trying to get though.
          
                Burke is positioning C-4 charges around the Lab. He wires
                them all through a remote detonator.

                Carnby approaches the sliding metal door at the side of the
                Lab. The dust around the door has been swept back.

                             where Hudgens got in.
          
                Carnby engages the opening mechanism and the door slides
                open, revealing a dark Tunnel leading away from it.
          
                Burke makes sure the remote detonator signal is active. All
                he has to do is press the button on the detonator.
          
                The hangar doors SHAKE from the impacts of creatures slamming
                into them.

                A few doors line the Tunnel, but they are all welded shut.

                The Tunnel ends at the rungs of a metal ladder built right
                into the wall. Aline shines her flashlight up it. A strip of
                light is visible way up high, at the top of a long Shaft.
          
                Aline climbs up the ladder. Carnby climbs up behind her.
          
                Burke shines his lamp down the dark Tunnel. The CRASHING
                sound of impacts against the doors echo down the Tunnel.
          
                Burke looks at the remote detonator in his hand. The signal

                Burke enters the Lab. He closes the sliding door behind him.
          
          
          
          
                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                Carnby gets to the sliding door just as it's closing. He
                tries to engage the opening mechanism, but it won't work.
                Carnby tries to pull it open, but the door's jammed shut.
          
                 line runs up to Carnby as he tries to pry open the door.
          
                                    ALINE
                          Edward... if he detonates those charges,
                          we're all dead.
          
                Carnby looks torn. Aline reaches out her hand.
          
                Carnby takes Aline's hand. They run towards the Shaft.

                Burke's rifle is jammed into the opening mechanism of the
                sliding door, blocking it from engaging.
          
                The hangar doors are warped from the impacts. The gap between
                the doors is being pulled open by dozens of creatures. The
                hangar doors start to buckle under the pressure.
          
                 he remote detonator in Burke's hand is now active.

                Carnby and Aline quickly climb up the ladder. They are almost
                at the top of the Shaft.
          
                The Shaft is sealed with a pair of corrugated metal doors.
                Sunlight shines through the thin crack between the doors.
          
                Carnby points his gun at the metal doors above them.

                A small Storm Cellar is built into a corner of the

                from the outside with a chain and rusty padlock.
          
                A BURST of GUNFIRE blows out from inside the Storm Cellar,
                breaking open the padlock. The doors are thrown open.

               The creatures are almost through the hangar doors. The gap is
               just wide enough for one creature to stick its head through.
               It SNAPS its jaws at Burke.
          
               Burke presses the button on the detonator. The detonator
               counts down: 3... 2... 1...
          
          181F INT. UNDERGROUND LAB/SHAFT                                   181F
               A tremendous EXPLOSION rocks the Shaft. A swirling geyser of
               flame shoots up towards the top of the Shaft.

               Carnby and Aline dive out of the Shaft just in time. The
               geyser of flame erupts out of the Storm Cellar.
          
               The shock-wave knocks them to the ground. A cloud of dust
               swirls up out of the Shaft.

               The Mine shakes from the explosion. Great clouds of dust and
               rock fragments billow out of the Entrance Hall.

               Aline and Carnby get to their feet outside the Storm Cellar.
               Smoke pours out of the Shaft.
          
               But as he sees where he really is, Carnby is stunned. He
               stares up at the Orphanage.

               Carnby and Aline walk through the Orphanage. It is clean,
               well-maintained. But no one is there. The Orphanage is empty.

               door.

                Carnby and Aline stand at the doorway.
          
                Sister Clara lies dead on one of the children's beds. The
                blankets and sheets are soaked with blood.
          
                A bloody gash has been sliced up each of Sister Clara's arms.
                A blood-stained straight-razor sits on the bedside table.
          
                A crumpled piece of paper is clutched in one of Sister
                Clara's hands. Carnby takes the paper and uncrumples it.
          
                The notes reads: "FORGIVE ME, EDWARD."

                Aline and Carnby step out of the Orphanage. Carnby looks
                around, troubled. No one is visible outside the Orphanage.
          
                                       CARNBY

                Carnby and Aline walk along a deserted street. The sun rises
                above them. It's a beautiful day.
          
                Shops look ready to open. Cars are parked along the streets.
                But no one is driving. The neighborhood is empty.

                                       ALINE

                Carnby looks ashen. They stand in the middle of a downtown
                intersection, empty streets stretching out in all directions.

                    Then where the hell is everybody? Where's
                    everybody gone?
          
          We look down at Carnby and Aline, alone in the intersection,
          empty streets all around them. We start to float up above
          them, getting a wider and wider bird's eye view of the city.
          
          We swoop up higher above them, but still, no one is visible
          anywhere in the city. We float up until the entire city
          stretches out below us. Nothing moves. No one can be seen.
          
                              CARNBY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Here's what I know. There are two worlds
                    on this planet. A world of light and a
                    world of darkness. For millions of years,
                    these worlds were in balance. But now,
                    the lights of human civilization burn
                    everywhere. The dark places are
                    disappearing. We forced them to come out
                    of the shadows. Now, it's my job to force
                    them back in. My name is Edward Carnby.
                    I'm here to protect you from things you
                    don't believe in.
          
          We start to drop back down, faster and faster, the ground
          rushing towards us. We are descending directly above Carnby
          and Aline, standing alone in the empty intersection.
          
          We swoop down right in front of Carnby. His trench-coat blows
          in the wind. Aline stands next to him, ready.
          
          Carnby reloads his revolver.

                              CARNBY
                    It's going to be a busy day.
          
          The sun shines down above them, illuminating the deserted
          city streets. Carnby's expression is determined.

AMERICAN PSYCHO

Fourth Draft 
November 1998


INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. 
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged 
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths 
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous 
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and 
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: 
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.

WAITER 
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula 
Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish 
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge 
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen 
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four 
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of 
conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse 
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."

WAITER 
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our 
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate 
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID 
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing 
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back 
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. 

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California 
place on the Upper East Side.

The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately 
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's 
description of each of the men at the table.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in 
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences 
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van 
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the 
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a 
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten 
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . 

VAN PATTEN 
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT 
What do you mean?

PRICE 
Yes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT 
Well, is it strictly informal-

BATEMAN 
Or can it be worn with a suit?

McDERMOTT 
(Smiling) 
Exactly

BATEMAN 
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or 
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder 
vest.

McDERMOTT 
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look 
too studied.

VAN PATTEN 
You think so?

PRICE 
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

VAN PATTEN 
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy 
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.

BATEMAN 
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

PRICE 
It looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT 
(Staring at retreating waiter) 
Did he just take our plates away?

PRICE 
He took them away because the portions are so small he 
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. 
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT 
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE 
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT 
Who is it then?

PRICE 
That's Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back 
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Who is he with?

PRICE 
(Distracted by the waitress's 
cleavage as she bends over to 
uncork a bottle of wine  the 
waitress glares at him) 
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.

VAN PATTEN 
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT 
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?

PRICE 
Yes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT 
He's handling the Fisher account.

PRICE 
Lucky bastard.

McDERMOTT 
Lucky Jew bastard.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with 
anything?

McDERMOTT 
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The 
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.

BATEMAN 
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. 
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT 
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?

BATEMAN 
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT 
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the 
ACLU.

Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.

PRICE 
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking 
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT 
Only $470.

VAN PATTEN 
(Without irony) 
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is 
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT 
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-

VAN PATTEN 
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this 
story again.

McDERMOTT 
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So 
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big 
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I 
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on 
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the 
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-

BATEMAN 
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all 
this?

McDERMOTT 
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick 
who's gonna let me-

VAN PATTEN 
(Putting his hands over his ears) 
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something 
disgusting.

McDERMOTT 
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op 
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some 
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT 
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to 
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking 
rhino tipsy, and get this-

VAN PATTEN 
She let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT 
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She 
would only-are you ready? 
(Dramatic pause) 
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept 
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.

EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. 
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, 
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT 
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask 
him if he takes American Express.

PRICE 
(Offering card) 
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, 
unhooks the 
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.

INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT 

Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a 
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. 
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls 
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the 
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as 
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they 
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple 
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes 
past them and slams the door.

PRICE 
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the 
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, 
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular 
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for 
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

BATEMAN 
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a 
virus.

PRICE 
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is 
sweating.

PRICE 
I'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.

PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

BATEMAN 
Maybe it's just the light.

PRICE 
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips 
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) 
Oh my God...

BATEMAN 
What?

PRICE 
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.

BATEMAN 
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do 
enough of it we'll be okay.

PRICE 
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it 
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate 
voice:

GUY IN STALL 
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.

PRICE 
(screaming) 
SHUT UP!

BATEMAN 
Calm down. Let's do it anyway

PRICE 
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice) 
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

GUY IN STALL 
Fuck you!

PRICE 
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) 
No, FUCK YOU!! 
(He collapses, panting against the stall door) 
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.

BATEMAN 
That's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope 
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking 
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into 
their gums.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

Bateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" 
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.

BARGIRL 
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's 
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her 
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for 
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to 
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is 
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING 

Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. 
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows 
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist 
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large 
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive 
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly 
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of 
a design magazine.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am 
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden 
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh 
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to 
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his 
toilet.

BATEMAN 
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a 
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the 
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice 
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand 
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living 
room wearing the ice pack.

CUT TO:

A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the 
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep 
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a 
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body 
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a 
gel facial masque.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which 
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my 
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is 
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He 
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in 
readiness on the marble counter.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little 
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes 
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye 
balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, 
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been 
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque 
off his face.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some 
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an 
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold 
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you 
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably 
comparable: I simply am not there.

INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING 

Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled 
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large 
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by 
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a 
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, 
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and 
tone.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
It is hard for me to make sense on any given 
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality 
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is 
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a 
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, 
adjusting his cuff-links.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared 
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. 
He gives his reflection a smile.

INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY 

As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who 
looks just like him.

MAN 
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling 
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive, 
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.

JEAN 
Late?

BATEMAN 
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

JEAN 
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what 
he was canceling or why.

BATEMAN 
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. 
Anyone else?

JEAN 
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

BATEMAN 
When?

JEAN 
After six.

BATEMAN 
Negative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.

JEAN 
Oh? And what should I say?

BATEMAN
Just...say...no.

JEAN 
Just say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.

BATEMAN 
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols 
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All 
right?

JEAN 
(Playfully) 
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight 
tonight.

Jean turns around.

JEAN 
Oh, something. . romantic?

BATEMAN 
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

JEAN 
I'll do it.

BATEMAN 
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

JEAN 
You look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his 
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a 
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a 
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a 
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment 
later with the Perrier and a file.

JEAN 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that 
outfit again.

JEAN 
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

BATEMAN 
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a 
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.

JEAN 
(Smiling bravely) 
You don't like this, I take it?

BATEMAN 
Come on, you're prettier than that.

JEAN 
(Sarcastically) 
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner 
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!

INT. TAXI - EVENING 

EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's 
fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping 
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically 
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with 
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a 
small child.

EVELYN 
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd 
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something 
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots 
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring 
out the window.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm trying to listen to the new George 
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing 
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.

EVELYN 
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. 
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. 
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

BATEMAN 
(Removing his Walkman) 
Do...what.

EVELYN 
Get married. Have a wedding.

BATEMAN 
Evelyn?

EVELYN 
Yes, darling?

BATEMAN 
Is your Evian spiked?

EVELYN 
We should do it.

BATEMAN 
No-I can't take the time off work.

EVELYN 
Your father practically owns the company. You can do 
anything you like, silly.

BATEMAN 
I don't want to talk about it.

EVELYN 
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just 
quit? You don't have to work.

BATEMAN 
Because I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in 
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed 
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel 
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are 
made of extremely uncomfortable 
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace 
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, 
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are 
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, 
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with 
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus 
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE 
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long 
kiss.

PRICE 
I have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.

EVELYN 
(Over her shoulder) 
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden 
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

BATEMAN 
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and 
checking his hair) 
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.

BATEMAN 
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH 
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. 
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from 
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is 
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is 
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a 
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He 
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and 
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, 
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, 
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY 
(Whispering) 
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is 
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching 
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn 
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s 
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight 
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, 
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, 
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is 
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I read that.

PRICE 
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN 
Hey. That affects us.

PRICE 
(Wired on coke) 
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What 
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that 
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri 
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of 
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

BATEMAN 
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important 
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign 
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems 
at hand.

PRICE 
Like what?

BATEMAN 
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow 
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world 
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We 
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We 
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and 
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while 
also promoting equal rights for women but change the 
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still 
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN 
We also have to control the influx of illegal 
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional 
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in 
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have 
to promote general social concern and less materialism in 
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and 
mystified.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, how thought-provoking.

INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING 

Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.

BATEMAN 
Why don t you just go for Price?

EVELYN 
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

BATEMAN 
He's rich.

EVELYN 
Everybody's rich.

BATEMAN 
He's good-looking.

EVELYN 
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
He has a great body

EVELYN 
Everybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get 
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the 
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, 
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to 
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.

EVELYN 
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.

EVELYN 
Are you using minoxidil?

BATEMAN 
No. I'm not. Why should I ?

EVELYN 
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

BATEMAN 
It's not.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 

It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the 
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. 
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk 
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his 
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up 
to her as she pauses at a red light.

BATEMAN 
Hello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing 
his smile, smiles back.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 

Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit 
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry 
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language, 
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.

BATEMAN 
What are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained 
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.

BATEMAN 
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? 
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.

BATEMAN 
(Talking over her) 
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. 
Two.
(Louder) 
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very 
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN 
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill 
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN 
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting 
(Checks Rolex) 
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those 
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at 
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need 
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with 
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN 
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA, 
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a 
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA 
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA 
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

BATEMAN 
Hello 
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.

BATEMAN 
Well.

VICTORIA 
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, 
but you
know. They really are the best.

BATEMAN 
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk 
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding 
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking 
again.

VICTORIA 
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN 
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA 
(Skeptically) Really?

BATEMAN 
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You 
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

VICTORIA 
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it. 
Fun with chocolate.

BATEMAN 
Listen, if you could talk to them 
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand) 
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a 
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.

VICTORIA 
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

BATEMAN 
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank 
you, uh...
Victoria?

VICTORIA 
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You 
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

BATEMAN 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the 
time.

VICTORIA 
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

BATEMAN 
(Checking his watch) 
Next Saturday?

VICTORIA 
(Shrugging) 
Yeah.

BATEMAN 
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. 
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call 
you.

VICTORIA 
Okay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes 
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound 
of the bell on the closing door.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to 
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one 
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear 
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.

BATEMAN 
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

COURTNEY 
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

BATEMAN 
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, 
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to 
tonight?

COURTNEY 
Stop it. I'm...

BATEMAN 
On a lot of lithium?

COURTNEY 
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call 
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY 
But-when?

BATEMAN 
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

COURTNEY 
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I 
need to be
home for that.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin?

COURTNEY 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

COURTNEY 
Uh huh.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New 
York.

COURTNEY 
I know. Stop it.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling 
dickweed.

COURTNEY 
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

BATEMAN 
Courtney? Dinner?

COURTNEY 
I can't.

BATEMAN 
I'm thinking Dorsia.

COURTNEY 
Dorsia's nice.

BATEMAN 
Nice?

COURTNEY 
You like it there, don't you?

BATEMAN 
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will 
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a 
boyfriend to eat there tonight.

COURTNEY 
Okay. Yeah. What time?

BATEMAN 
Eight? 

COURTNEY 
Pick me up? 

BATEMAN 
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear 
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the 
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so 
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with 
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there 
is finally an answer.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia.

BATEMAN 
(Both of his eyes are closed) 
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to 
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then 
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he 
hangs up the phone.

INT. TAXI- NIGHT

Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.

COURTNEY 
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really 
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this 
silver muffin dish. 
(She starts to pass out)

BATEMAN 
Is that Donald Trump's car?

COURTNEY 
(Thickly) 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

BATEMAN 
You know, Courtney, you should take some more 
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you 
out of this slump.

COURTNEY 
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads 
"Barcadia."

INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all 
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, 
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.

BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.

COURTNEY 
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with 
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman 
leans over and pulls her back up.

COURTNEY 
Are we here?

BATEMAN 
Yes.

COURTNEY 
This is Dorsia?

BATEMAN 
(Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script) 
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and 
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both 
shoulders and props her up.

BATEMAN 
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter 
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine 
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll 
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and 
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. 

COURTNEY 
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. 

She falls asleep at the table.

INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on 
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears 
it open with his teeth, puts it on.

COURTNEY 
(Dazed on lithium) 
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.

COURTNEY 
Luis is a despicable twit.

BATEMAN 
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.

COURTNEY 
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" 
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? 
Get off me.

BATEMAN 
Is it a what?

COURTNEY 
Pull out.

BATEMAN 
I'm ignoring you.

COURTNEY 
(screaming) 
Pull out, goddamnit!

BATEMAN 
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end. I think.

COURTNEY 
Turn the light on.

She tries to sit up.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

COURTNEY 
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light. 

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end, see? So? 

COURTNEY 
Take it off. 

BATEMAN 
Why? 

COURTNEY 
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip  
(She covers herself with her comforter) 
to catch the force of the ejaculate! 
BATEMAN 
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying. 

COURTNEY 
(Screaming) 
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.

BATEMAN 
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, 
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. 
(He slaps her again lightly) 
Why is it pulled down half an inch? 
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

COURTNEY 
(Choking crying) 
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. 
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.

BATEMAN 
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

COURTNEY 
Oh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and 
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their 
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the 
ceiling.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in 
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto 
a spectacular view of Manhattan.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a 
reservation there?

BATEMAN 
Lucky, I guess.

CARRUTHERS 
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, 
Valentino Couture?

BATEMAN 
Uh huh.

CARRUTHERS 
(Reaching out to touch it) 
It looks so soft.

BATEMAN 
(Catching Luis hand) 
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague 
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal 
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and 
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.

OWEN 
(To Bateman) 
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

BATEMAN 
I've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's 
thoughts.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. 
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in 
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a 
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. 
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have 
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS 
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the 
opposite corner of the room. He bears a 
superficial resemblance to Bateman.

OWEN 
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

BATEMAN 
(Nervous) 
It's...it's...all right.

OWEN 
Really? That's interesting. 
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?

BATEMAN 
Oh well, you know.

OWEN 
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

BATEMAN 
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT 
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.

OWEN 
Thank you, Baxter.

PRICE 
Listen, Paul. Squash?

OWEN 
Call me. 
(Hands him a business card)

PRICE 
How about Friday?

OWEN 
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea 
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away 
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.

PRICE
(Whispering) 
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering) 
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. 

PRICE 
(Suddenly enthused) 
What's that, a gram? 

BATEMAN 
New card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully. 

McDERMOTT 
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.

BATEMAN 
Picked them up from the printers yesterday

VAN PATTEN 
Good coloring.

BATEMAN 
That's bone. And the lettering is something called 
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT 
(Envious) 
Silian Rail?

VAN PATTEN 
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the 
table. 

VAN PATTEN 
Look at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it. 

PRICE 
That's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to 
control his anxiety.

VAN PATTEN 
Eggshell with Romalian type. 
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?

BATEMAN 
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak) 
Nice.

PRICE 
(Holding the card up to the light) 
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so 
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at 
McDermott's. 

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

PRICE 
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

He holds up his own card. 

PRICE 
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN 
(Choking with anxiety) 
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it 
up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE, 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless. 
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint 
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness 
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it 
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING 

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of 
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns 
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open 
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A 
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM 
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies 
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green 
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN 
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN 
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his 
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN 
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
It's cold out, too, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) 
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you 
get a job?

HOMELESS MAN 
(Shivering and sobbing) 
I lost my job...

BATEMAN 
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? 
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on 
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.

BATEMAN 
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm not...

BATEMAN 
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry

BATEMAN 
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. 
I'm trying to help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry.

BATEMAN 
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who 
do have jobs? From people who do work?

HOMELESS MAN 
What am I gonna do?

BATEMAN 
Listen, what's your name?

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Speak up. Come on.

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. 
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. 
I'll help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.

BATEMAN 
(Petting the dog) 
Shhhh...it's okay.

HOMELESS MAN 
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist) 
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

BATEMAN 
(Stroking his face, whispering) 
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

HOMELESS MAN 
I can't...I can't find a shelter

BATEMAN 
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? 
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of 
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.

BATEMAN 
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common 
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with 
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to 
protect it.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is 
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.

BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street. 
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the 
body left twitching on the ground.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY 

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a 
woman's hands rub cream into his face.

FACIALIST 
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So 
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he 
closes them again.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, 
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except 
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside 
me and I don't know why.

CUT TO:

Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the 
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his 
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, 
on the verge of frenzy.

CUT TO:

Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning 
bed, wearing goggles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an 
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets, 
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.

BATEMAN 
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of 
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.

OWEN 
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro 
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one 
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the 
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten 
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of 
cilantro crawfish gumbo?

WAITER 
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen 
earlier today, and-

BATEMAN 
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.

WAITER 
Would you like to hear-

OWEN 
Double Absolut martini.

WAITER 
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?

BATEMAN 
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.

OWEN 
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. 

This place is hot, very hot.

BATEMAN 
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous 
here.

OWEN 
Yeah, well, you're late.

BATEMAN 
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break 
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood) 
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

OWEN 
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

BATEMAN 
Nobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.

BATEMAN 
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez 
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana 
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.

BATEMAN 
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the 
Fisher account? How did you get it?

OWEN 
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have 
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.

LATER: 
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.

BATEMAN 
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another 
drink.

OWEN 
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.

OWEN 
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.

OWEN 
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

BATEMAN 
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think 
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.

OWEN 
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick 
Bateman. What a dork.

BATEMAN 
Another Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.

LATER:

The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the 
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid 
down.

BATEMAN 
(Talking to Owen like a child) 
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

BATEMAN 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave 
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

OWEN 
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

BATEMAN 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. 
(Helping him into his jacket) 
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a 
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with 
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass 
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN 
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN 
They're okay.
BATEMAN 
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN 
(Said partly from the bathroom) 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN 
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys 
catalogue.

OWEN 
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Owen?

OWEN 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over 
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

BATEMAN 
No, Owen.

OWEN 
(Confused) 
Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN 
Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its 
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN 
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the 
ax raised over his head.

BATEMAN 
Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing 
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame. 
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

BATEMAN 
(Raising the ax and screaming) 
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the 
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.

BATEMAN 
(Panting) 
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the 
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly 
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He 
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 

BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby, 
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his 
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

CARRUTHERS 
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good 
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to 
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. 
(Looking down at the body) 
Where did you get your overnight bag?

BATEMAN 
Commes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get 
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.

CARRUTHERS 
Call me please, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
Jesus lives, Luis.

INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT 

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank 
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in 
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the 
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very 
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls 
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting 
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale 
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN 
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN 
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans 
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

BATEMAN 
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London 
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. 
Hasta la vista, baby.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING 

Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of 
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing 
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes 
the Walkman off.

BATEMAN 
(Faintly irritable) 
What is it?

JEAN 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
(Condescendingly) 
Ye-es, Je-an?

JEAN 
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

BATEMAN 
Who?

JEAN 
Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the 
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back 
cover of Sports Illustrated.

BATEMAN 
Tell him I'm at lunch.

JEAN 
(whispering) 
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. 
It's only ten-thirty. 

Silence. 

BATEMAN 
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless 
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.

BATEMAN 
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion 
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good 
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt 
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD 
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - 
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of 
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a 
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to 
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at 
him curiously, noticing the silence.

BATEMAN 
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) 
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in 
exasperation. 

KIMBALL nods understandingly.

BATEMAN 
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just 
walked in...
(He laughs inanely) 
Just joking...
(Pause) 
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, 
right, got it. 
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) 
Sorry about that.

KIMBALL 
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. 
(Gesturing toward the phone) 
Was that anything important?

BATEMAN 
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. 
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.

KIMBALL 
(Holding out his hand) 
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

BATEMAN 
(Shaking firmly) 
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

KIMBALL 
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed 
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, 
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports 
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. 
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines 
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is 
still running.

BATEMAN 
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) 
So, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate 
the disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

KIMBALL 
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

BATEMAN 
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

KIMBALL 
So it's nothing that official. I just have some 
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

BATEMAN 
Coffee?

KIMBALL 
No. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL 
No, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold 
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes 
Jean.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Can you bring Mr...

KIMBALL 
KIMBALL.

BATEMAN 
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

KIMBALL 
Oh no, I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
It's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down 
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters 
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched 
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman. 
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.

BATEMAN 
Well, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the 
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh) 
Not on "Page Six" at least.

KIMBALL 
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

BATEMAN 
Understandable. 
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino) 
Lime?

KIMBALL 
No, really. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own 
files, okay?

BATEMAN 
Shoot.

KIMBALL 
How old are you?

BATEMAN 
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

KIMBALL 
(Scribbling in his notebook) 
Where did you go to school?

BATEMAN 
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

KIMBALL 
Your address?

BATEMAN 
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.

KIMBALL 
(Looking up, impressed) 
Nice. Very nice.

BATEMAN 
(Flattered) 
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.

KIMBALL 
Pardon me, but are you okay?

BATEMAN 
Who do you ask?

KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a 
bottle of aspirin.

BATEMAN 
Nuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the 
desk.

BATEMAN 
Bad habit.

KIMBALL 
I know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.

KIMBALL 
Would you rather I not smoke?

BATEMAN 
No, I guess it's okay.

KIMBALL 
You sure?

BATEMAN 
No problem. 
(Buzzing Jean)

JEAN (O.S.) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

KIMBALL 
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
Well...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows 
them dry.

KIMBALL 
How well did you know him?

BATEMAN 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, 
you know.

KIMBALL 
Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Yeah...Yale thing.

KIMBALL 
What do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet 
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner 
becomes deafening.

KIMBALL 
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul 
Owen?

BATEMAN 
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.

KIMBALL 
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile) 
the information you've just given.

BATEMAN 
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

KIMBALL 
Do you feel that way?

BATEMAN 
No. Not really.

KIMBALL 
(As he writes without looking up) 
Where did Paul hang out?

BATEMAN 
Hang...out?

KIMBALL 
Yeah. You know...hang out.

BATEMAN 
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular 
places.

KIMBALL 
He had a yacht?

BATEMAN 
No, he just hung out there.

KIMBALL 
And where did he go to school?

A slight pause.

BATEMAN 
Don't you know this?

KIMBALL 
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN 
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.

KIMBALL 
I understand.

He makes another note.

KIMBALL 
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

BATEMAN 
We were both seven in 1969.

KIMBALL 
(Smiles) 
So was I.

BATEMAN 
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

KIMBALL 
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he 
went to London.

BATEMAN 
Well, maybe he did, huh?

KIMBALL 
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

BATEMAN 
But...has anyone seen him in London?

KIMBALL 
Actually, yes.

BATEMAN 
Hmmm.

KIMBALL 
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. 
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but 
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert 
Ainsworth for Paul, so...

BATEMAN 
Oh.

KIMBALL 
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I 
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't 
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was 
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano 
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

BATEMAN 
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced 
diet and-

KIMBALL 
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.

BATEMAN 
Have you consulted a psychic?

KIMBALL 
No.

BATEMAN 
Had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL 
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A 
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

BATEMAN 
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet 
or anything, right?

KIMBALL 
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.

BATEMAN 
That's so typical, isn't it?

KIMBALL 
It's just strange. 
(He stares out the window, lost in thought) 
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, 
and then...

BATEMAN 
Nothing.

KIMBALL 
People just...disappear.

BATEMAN 
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
(He checks his Rolex)

KIMBALL 
Eerie. Really eerie.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
(Standing up) 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting 
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

KIMBALL 
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I 
mean aren't you going to be late?

BATEMAN 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

KIMBALL 
Oh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.

BATEMAN 
Yes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.

KIMBALL 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information 
at all...

BATEMAN 
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

KIMBALL 
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his 
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 

A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, 
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect 
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard 
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal 
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, 
next to a copy of GQ.

LATER:

Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, 
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.

BATEMAN 
You like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.

BATEMAN 
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar 
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white 
cotton T-shirt by 
Commes des Garcons. 
(He snorts like a pig) 
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.

BATEMAN 
(Whipering) 
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do 
you think of that? 
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) 
Huh, bitch?

GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.

EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 

Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside 
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. 
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.

BATEMAN 
I haven't seen you around here.

CHRISTIE 
You just haven't been looking.

BATEMAN 
Would you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a 
tuxedo.

CHRISTIE 
(looking away to some dark corner) 
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now 
notices, then takes.

BATEMAN 
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

CHRISTIE 
I'm not supposed to. 
(She pockets the bill) 
But I can make an exception.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.

BATEMAN 
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He 
reads off a credit card number.

BATEMAN 
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does 
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the 
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really 
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? 
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is 
that clear?

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white 
milky bath oil.

BATEMAN 
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and 
Bateman is casually touching her breast.

BATEMAN 
I want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.

BATEMAN 
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.

BATEMAN 
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry 
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and 
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN 
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. 
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes 
her coat and inspects her body and face.

BATEMAN 
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm 
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a 
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the 
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a 
long silence.

BATEMAN 
So, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles. 
Christie shrugs.

CHRISTIE 
No.

SABRINA 
(Smiling) 
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN 
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce. 
(Long pause) 
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands 
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE 
You have a really nice place here...Paul. 
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN 
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, 
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a 
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN 
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN 
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina 
takes one.

BATEMAN 
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very 
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. 
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN 
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis 
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before 
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too 
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' 
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out 
another one.

BATEMAN 
I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him 
into the bedroom.

BATEMAN 
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the 
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding 
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to 
put it on.

BATEMAN 
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, 
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance 
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.

BATEMAN 
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer 
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. 
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.

BATEMAN 
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this 
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political 
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather 
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves. 

BATEMAN 
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about 
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. 
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything 
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera. 

BATEMAN 
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your 
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.

BATEMAN 
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and 
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially 
songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against 
All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. 

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in 
the CD.

BATEMAN 
But I also think that Phill Collins works better 
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and 
I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, 
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or 
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.

CUT TO: 

Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina 
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his 
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.

BATEMAN 
Don't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, 
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns 
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up 
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.

BATEMAN 
We're not through yet...

CUT TO:

Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They 
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a 
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the 
b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing.

INT. YALE CLUB  DAY
 
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are 
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and 
gives them the finger.

BATEMAN 
What an asshole.

McDERMOTT 
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a 
fucking drug addict. No self-control.

VAN PATTEN 
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do 
you think, Bateman?

BATEMAN 
I know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT 
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it 
like that?

VAN PATTEN 
Because he dated her.

BATEMAN 
How did you guess?

VAN PATTEN 
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, 
Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy 
personality.

McDERMOTT 
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a 
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other 
reason.

VAN PATTEN 
If they have a good personality, then something 
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT 
If they have a good personality and they are not 
great looking-who fucking cares?

BATEMAN 
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if 
they have a good personality? 
(He smiles giving up) 
I know, I know-

ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities! 
(They laugh and high-five each other)

VAN PATTEN 
A good personality consists of a chick with a 
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without 
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep 
her dumb fucking mouth 
shut.

McDERMOTT 
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even 
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly 
chicks.

VAN PATTEN 
Absolutely.

McDERMOTT 
And this is because they have to make up for how 
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

VAN PATTEN 
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

BATEMAN 
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was 
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT 
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN 
He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the 
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her 
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat 
her right."

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT 
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN 
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back 
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS 
(Shyly) 
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you 
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to 
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone 
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear 
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously. 
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with 
himself.

VAN PATTEN 
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN 
(Suddenly angry) 
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about 
fucking dinner?" 

McDERMOTT 
Ah, cheer up, Bateman. 
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) 
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? 

BATEMAN 
(Watching Luis going into the men's room) 
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT 
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN 
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van 
Patten grabs a waiter.

VAN PATTEN 
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring 
me an Evian or something, okay?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 

Bateman pulls on his gloves as he 
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his 
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman 
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands 
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his 
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear 
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to 
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in 
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's 
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck 
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side 
of his face.

CARRUTHERS 
God, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.

CARRUTHERS 
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs 
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers 
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops 
them again.

CARRUTHERS 
Don't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift 
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.

CARRUTHERS 
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas 
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that 
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are 
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and 
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he 
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up 
behind him.

CARRUTHERS 
I want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter 
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d' 
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely, 
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at 
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.

BATEMAN 
(Hissing) 
What...is...it?

CARRUTHERS 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
(Stumbling away from him) 
I've gotta...I've 
gotta...return some videotapes.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
What?
CARRUTHERS 
(Silently mouthing the words) 
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.

INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. 
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels 
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, 
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.

COURTNEY 
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

BATEMAN 
Maybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her 
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins 
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches 
the TV at low volume.

COURTNEY 
What are you doing tonight?

BATEMAN 
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

COURTNEY 
That's nice.

BATEMAN 
You and...Luis?

COURTNEY 
(Lighting a cigarette) 
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and 
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

BATEMAN 
I never knew you smoked.

COURTNEY 
(Smiling sadly) 
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.

COURTNEY 
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

BATEMAN 
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're 
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

COURTNEY 
(Sarcastically) 
Isn't that special? 
(A pause) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Courtney?

C0URTNEY 
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?

BATEMAN 
(Flatly) 
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its 
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.

COURTNEY 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes?

COURTNEY 
Nothing.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop 
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and 
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a 
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.

KIMBALL 
Mr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.

BATEMAN 
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL 
Kimball. 
(Extending his hand) 
Call me Don.

BATEMAN 
Don.

KIMBALL 
So...you hang out here a lot?

BATEMAN 
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You 
know.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone 
in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks 
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)

KIMBALL 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

BATEMAN 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at his glass) 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much 
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, 
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.

KIMBALL 
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.

KIMBALL 
I mean they want to get caught.

BATEMAN 
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need 
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean 
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from 
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.

BATEMAN 
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.

BATEMAN 
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a 
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in 
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott 
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black 
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered 
argument.

PRICE 
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT 
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder. 
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring 
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to 
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.

PRICE 
(Clapping his hands together) 
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.

LIBBY 
Where did Craig go?

PRICE 
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to 
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States 
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.

LIBBY 
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.

PRICE 
You're not confused, are you?

LIBBY 
No, not really.

CARON 
Gorbachev's not downstairs.

DAISY 
(Smiling) 
Are you Iying?

PRICE 
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's 
at Tunnel.

BATEMAN 
(To Daisy) 
Ask me a question.

DAISY 
So, what do you do?

BATEMAN 
What do you think I do?

DAISY 
A model? An actor?

BATEMAN 
No. Flattering, but no.

DAISY 
Well...

BATEMAN 
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed) 
Do you like it?

BATEMAN 
Welt...it depends, why?

DAISY 
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and 
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
So, where do you work out?

MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING: 

The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a 
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him 
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over 
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman 
is reaching for him.

PRICE 
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

BATEMAN 
Leaving what?

PRICE 
This.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his 
drink.

BATEMAN 
Don't, I'll drink it.

PRICE 
(Screaming) 
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

BATEMAN 
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

PRICE 
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

BATEMAN 
Don't tell me...merchant banking?

PRICE 
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm 
disappearing.

BATEMAN 
(laughing) 
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT 
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is 
shouting something that can't be heard, then

PRICE 
Goodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?

BATEMAN 
Price! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment 
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT 
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.

DAISY 
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays 
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand 
what I was doing with a yuppie.

BATEMAN 
Oh really?
DAISY 
He said...
(She laughs) 
He said you gave him bad vibes.

BATEMAN 
That's...that's too bad.

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

BATEMAN 
What?

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

BATEMAN 
(insincerely) No. I really don't.

DAISY 
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

She takes his hand as they get into a cab.

INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses 
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the 
case.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 

Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York 
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with 
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.

JEAN 
Doin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.

JEAN 
Need help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the 
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean 
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.

BATEMAN 
Jean?

JEAN 
(Re-enters office) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.

BATEMAN 
That is...if you're not doing anything.

JEAN 
Oh no. I have no plans.

BATEMAN 
(Lowering his Wayfarers) 
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Listen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.

JEAN 
Anywhere you want?

BATEMAN 
Let's not think about what I want. How about 
anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

BATEMAN 
No, come on. Anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh, I can't. 
(Sighs) 
I don't know.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.

JEAN 
What about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles 
at her.

BATEMAN 
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

JEAN 
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

BATEMAN 
Dorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?

BATEMAN 
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at 
nine o'clock?

He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.

MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Oh really? That's great.

MAITRE D' 
I said we are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Two at nine? Perfect.

MAITRE D' 
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is 
also totally booked.

BATEMAN 
See you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He 
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the 
desk, confused.

BATEMAN 
Yes? You're dressed...okay.

JEAN 
You didn't give them a name.

BATEMAN 
They know me.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock 
for drinks, okay?

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 

Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.

JEAN 
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady 
visible.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Sorbet?

JEAN 
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in 
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.

JEAN 
Want a bite?

BATEMAN 
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

JEAN 
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? 
You look great. Very fit.

BATEMAN 
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) 
You can always he thinner. Look...better.

JEAN 
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't 
want to ruin your willpower.

BATEMAN 
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling 
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up 
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.

BATEMAN 
So listen, what do you really want to do with your 
life?

Pause.

BATEMAN 
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, 
okay?

JEAN 
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, 
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life 
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge 
of the blade.

BATEMAN 
Do you have a boyfriend?

JEAN 
No, not really.

BATEMAN 
Interesting.

JEAN 
(Shyly) 
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

BATEMAN 
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very 
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, 
twine and a nail gun.

BATEMAN 
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

JEAN 
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused 
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about 
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

BATEMAN 
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, 
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

JEAN 
Who's Ted Bundy?

BATEMAN 
Forget it.

JEAN 
What's that?

BATEMAN 
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the 
nail gun.

JEAN 
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.

BATEMAN 
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun) 
What...No! Put it in the carton.

JEAN 
Sorry. 
(She puts the spoon in the carton)

BATEMAN 
Jean? What?

JEAN 
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.

BATEMAN 
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just 
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

JEAN 
Hmmmm. 

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun 
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman 
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch. 
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she 
listens to the message.

EVELYN 
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. 
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope 
you're not out with some little number you picked up because 
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never 
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for 
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with 
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, 
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell 
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! 
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.

JEAN 
Was that...Evelyn?

Silence.

JEAN 
Are you still seeing her?

Silence.

JEAN 
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.

JEAN 
Do you want me to go?

A long pause.

BATEMAN 
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

JEAN 
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get 
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you 
want me to go?

Another long pause.

BATEMAN 
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I 
think I might hurt you. 
(Almost hopefully) 
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

JEAN 
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. 
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.

JEAN 
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with 
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

BATEMAN 
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY 

Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside 
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with 
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for 
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting 
the door behind him.

BATEMAN 
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come 
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.

KIMBALL 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's 
taken a leave of absence.

BATEMAN 
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. 
(Hopefully) 
Is he a suspect?

KIMBALL 
Not really.

A pause.

KIMBALL 
Do you remember where you were on the night of 
Paul's disappearance? 
(He checks his notebook) 
Which was on the twentieth of December?

BATEMAN 
God...I guess...I was probably returning 
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his 
diary.

BATEMAN 
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

KIMBALL 
Wait. That's not what I've got.

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
That's not the information I've received.

BATEMAN 
Well...I...Wait...What information have 
you received?

KIMBALL 
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook) 
That you were with-

BATEMAN 
Well, I could he wrong.

KIMBALL 
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
(Clearly nervous and under pressure) 
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It 
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner 
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I 
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't 
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens 
his briefcase to put away his notebook.

KIMBALL 
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long 
day-a bit scattered.

KIMBALL 
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch 
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

BATEMAN 
Great, yes, I'd like that.

KIMBALL 
And if you could try and pin down where you were 
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a 
lot easier.

BATEMAN 
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a 
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.

KIMBALL 
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I 
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.

BATEMAN 
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.

KIMBALL 
Not a big music fan, eh?

BATEMAN 
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.

KIMBALL 
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll 
call your secretary about reservations.

BATEMAN 
I'll be there.

EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. 
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a 
half-opened window.

CHRISTIE 
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after 
last time...

BATEMAN 
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

CHRISTIE 
I don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.

BATEMAN 
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.

BATEMAN 
Nothing like last time, promise.

CHRISTIE 
Alright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.

BATEMAN 
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) 
So, you're looking great, how have you been?

CHRISTIE 
(A little confused) 
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

BATEMAN 
(Mock shock) 
Really?

CHRISTIE 
My friend told me I should maybe even get a 
lawyer.

BATEMAN 
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to 
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets 
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.

BATEMAN 
Bitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge 
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to 
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the 
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.

BATEMAN 
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.

BATEMAN 
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, 
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. 
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything 
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped 
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an 
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally. 
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to 
examine a CD.

ELIZABETH 
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and 
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth 
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.

ELIZABETH 
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.

ELIZABETH 
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.

ELIZABETH 
You know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.

ELIZABETH 
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at 
the floor. There is an awkward silence.

CHRISTIE 
This is nicer than your other apartment.

BATEMAN 
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) 
It's not that nice.

Silence.

CHRISTIE 
Where did you two meet?

ELIZABETH 
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, 
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick) 
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. 
(Sarcastically) 
Hot number.

BATEMAN 
What do you mean, she was a hot number.

ELIZABETH 
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. 
(To Christie) 
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor. 

BATEMAN 
She's my...cousin. 

ELIZABETH 
(Skeptically) 
Uh huh? 

BATEMAN
She's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously. 

ELIZABETH 
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares 
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. 

ELIZABETH 
Where do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.

CHRISTIE 
No.

ELIZABETH 
(Listening to the receiver) 
Oh God, it's his machine.

BATEMAN 
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

ELIZABETH 
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

BATEMAN 
Don't tell him you're here.

ELIZABETH 
Why would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.

ELIZABETH 
This tastes weird. 
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway 
you'd like. I'm at-

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
You're at Paul Owen s.

ELIZABETH 
Who?

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
Paul Owen.

ELIZABETH 
I want the number, idiot. 
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever) 
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I 
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my 
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.

ELIZABETH 
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce 
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

BATEMAN 
No.

ELIZABETH 
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her 
another glass of the drugged wine.

BATEMAN 
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. 
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

ELIZABETH 
(Laughing) 
Patrick, you re a lunatic.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

ELIZABETH 
Let's not get lewd. 
(Flirty) 
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

BATEMAN 
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

ELIZABETH 
(To Christie) 
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.

BATEMAN 
(To Elizabeth) 
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

ELIZABETH 
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

BATEMAN 
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

ELIZABETH 
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me 
feel weird.

LATER:

Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making 
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, 
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP 
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles 
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps 
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's 
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album 
on a first listening.

ELIZABETH 
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You 
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.

BATEMAN 
(Ignoring her) 
It's hard to choose a favorite track 
among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" 
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about 
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message 
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope 
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. 
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in 
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with 
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD 
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and 
watches it slide into the machine.

BATEMAN 
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's 
beautifully stated on the album.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and 
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by 
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an 
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are 
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against 
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are 
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional 
performance, turning her head every so often to check the 
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, 
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then 
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind 
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps 
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the 
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split 
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening 
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the 
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams, 
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE 
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.

She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by 
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she 
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the 
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then 
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, 
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at 
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom. 
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the 
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He 
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the 
front door.

He runs after her.

BATEMAN 
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you 
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the 
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her. 
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims 
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown 
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of 
her back like a sword.

INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING 

An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper 
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary 
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on 
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the 
chainsaw in her back.

EVELYN 
I want a firm commitment.

BATEMAN 
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.

EVELYN 
(Distracted) 
Why? What's wrong?

BATEMAN 
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) 
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale 
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill 
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.

BATEMAN 
We need to talk.

EVELYN 
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk 
about?

BATEMAN 
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

EVELYN 
(Motioning to the waiter for water) 
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just 
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

BATEMAN 
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This 
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

EVELYN 
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your 
friends. I don't think it would work. 
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) 
You have a little something on your upper lip.

BATEMAN 
(Brushing her hand away) 
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about 
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a 
realization dawning.

EVELYN 
You're really serious, aren't you?

BATEMAN 
Yes, I am.

EVELYN 
But what about the past? Our past?

BATEMAN 
We never really shared one.

EVELYN 
You're inhuman.

BATEMAN 
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. 
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words) 
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.

EVELYN 
No, no, no.

BATEMAN 
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his 
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.

EVELYN 
(Sobbing) 
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.

BATEMAN 
(Looking uncomfortably around the room) 
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making 
this scene right now.

EVELYN 
Oh God, I can't believe this.

BATEMAN 
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the 
tears so they will not affect her make-up.

EVELYN 
(Surprisingly calm) 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
I'm just leaving.

EVELYN 
But where?

BATEMAN 
I have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.

EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING 

Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.

BATEMAN 
Here kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and 
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in 
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the 
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He 
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the 
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.

WOMAN 
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming 
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the 
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car 
screeches after him.

COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

Bateman ducks down an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 

A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from 
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away 
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of 
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He 
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.

COP CAR 
Halt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air. 
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the 
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light 
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living 
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows 
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each 
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a 
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches, 
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 

He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.

NIGHT WATCHMAN 
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You 
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the 
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he 
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He 
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.

NEW ANGLE: 

He runs out of the building and across the 
street to an identical office building, the one that houses 
Pierce & Pierce.

INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT 

Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs 
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close 
behind him.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

Bateman stands looking out 
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view 
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the 
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares 
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened, 
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating 
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into 
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.

BATEMAN 
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my 
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of 
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some 
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in 
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' 
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail 
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I 
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost 
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I 
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed 
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving 
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything 
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes 
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. 
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not 
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess 
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show 
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight 
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises 
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the 
sky.

INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY 

KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.

KIMBALL 
(Very surprised) 
No hash browns? 

BATEMAN 
Not in the mood, I guess.

KIMBALL 
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I 
mean- it's-have you been here before?

BATEMAN 
(Deliberately nonchalant) 
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at him like he's nuts) 
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.

KIMBALL 
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on 
what you did?

BATEMAN 
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some 
sorbet?

KIMBALL 
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

BATEMAN 
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

KIMBALL 
According to his date book, and this was verified by his 
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

BATEMAN 
And?

KIMBALL 
I've questioned him.

BATEMAN 
Marcus?

KIMBALL 
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't 
be sure.

BATEMAN 
But Marcus denied it?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

BATEMAN 
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
He does? You're sure?

KIMBALL 
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.

BATEMAN 
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you? 
(He laughs) 

BATEMAN 
(Laughing with him) 
Where was Marcus? 

KIMBALL 
He wasn't with Paul 
Owen. 

BATEMAN 
So who was he with? 

KIMBALL 
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, 
Harry Newman, George Butner and  
(He pauses, Then looks up) 
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.

BATEMAN 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen 
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner 
with Victoria...the following night. 

KIMBALL 
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for 
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. 
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or 
later. 
(A pause) 
I mean, to think that one of his friends 
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too 
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? 

McDermott stops by the table. 

McDERMOTT 
KIMBALL! How's the investigation? 
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. 
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) 
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? 

Bateman looks at him in silence, 
panicking. 

McDERMOTT 
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky 
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a 
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. 
(He wanders off muttering) 
No fucking hash browns...

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He 
has a surgical mask in one hand.

DOORMAN 
What can I do for you, sir?

BATEMAN 
20B.

DOORMAN 
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.

BATEMAN 
Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN 
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly 
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English 
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There 
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands 
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman 
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops 
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He 
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. 
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE 
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN 
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the 
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE 
Can I help you?

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

BATEMAN 
Doesn't he live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
No, he doesn't.

BATEMAN 
Are you sure?

MRS. WOLFE 
You saw the ad in the Times?

BATEMAN 
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
There was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.

MRS. WOLFE 
I think you should go now.

BATEMAN 
But I think...I want to know what happened 
here.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't come back.

BATEMAN 
I won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, 
rattled, and gets into the elevator.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

Bateman enters the revolving 
door of an office building, panicking and breathing 
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks 
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes 
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY 
just like him.

GUY 
Hey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.

GUY 
See you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down 
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage 
cans, etc.

EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY 

Bateman searches his pockets 
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows 
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his 
face, dialing a number.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick Bateman's office.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Hello? Jean?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
Hello? Jean, I need help!

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?

BATEMAN 
Jean-I'm not-

JEAN (O.S.) 
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and 
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

BATEMAN 
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? I can't hear you.

BATEMAN 
What are I doing?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

BATEMAN 
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
...to the office this afternoon.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Why?

BATEMAN 
(Screaming) 
Just...say...no!

JEAN (O.S.) 
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

BATEMAN 
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck 
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his 
jacket.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY 

Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens 
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING 

Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the 
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking 
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, 
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT 
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough 
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT 
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking 
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't 
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT 
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.

BATEMAN 
(On automatic) 
I'm not going anywhere unless we 
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, 
faggots-just get a res.

PRICE 
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. 

BATEMAN 
(He downs his drink) 
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously. 

CARNES 
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the 
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.

BATEMAN 
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.

BATEMAN 
So, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.

CARNES 
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, 
wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
(Waving smoke out of his face) 
Yes, naturally.

CARNES 
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s 
fabulous. That's rich...

Pause

CARNES 
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
What exactly do you mean?

CARNES 
The message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

CARNES 
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still 
seeing her, right?

BATEMAN 
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.

CARNES 
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.

BATEMAN 
Carnes? Wait.

CARNES 
(Sighing) 
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. 
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, 
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully 
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said 
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's 
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

BATEMAN 
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

CARNES 
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let 
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing 
couple. He laughs politely.

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

BATEMAN 
(Desperate, shouting) 
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really 
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. 
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. 
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your 
machine was true.

CARNES 
Excuse me. I really must he going.

BATEMAN 
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm 
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! 
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.

BATEMAN 
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed 
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

CARNES 
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find 
this funny anymore.

BATEMAN 
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

CARNES 
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.

BATEMAN 
Why not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.

CARNES 
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in 
London...just ten days ago.

BATEMAN 
No, you...didn't?

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald 
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are 
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's 
lying.

PRICE 
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

VAN PATTEN 
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? 
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have 
reservations somewhere.

PRICE 
(To Bateman) 
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT 
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that 
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, 
what can I say?

PRICE 
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that 
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so 
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

VAN PATTEN 
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.

PRICE 
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

BATEMAN 
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN 
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. 
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT 
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?

PRICE 
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless 
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.

PRICE 
But inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
But inside doesn't matter...

THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.

McDERMOTT 
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually 
listening to you.

PRICE 
Bateman? Come on, what do you think? 

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Whatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone. 

VAN PATTEN 
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs 
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of 
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing,

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with 
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, 
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward 
it, I have now surpassed...

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary. 
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with 
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost 
and frightened, and begins to cry.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better 
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on 
others. I want no escape.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING 
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is 
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, 
his eyes blank.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no 
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted 
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any 
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him: 
"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."

AMERICAN PSYCHO

November 1998


INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. 
The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged 
silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths 
decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous 
exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and 
confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: 
pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits.

CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials.

WAITER 
With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula 
Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish 
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge 
breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...

Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen 
table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four 
inches square and look exactly alike.

CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of 
conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse 
me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet."

WAITER 
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our 
pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate 
perpendicular desserts descending on another table.

PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID 
VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing 
expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back 
hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. 

The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins:

BATEMAN (V.O.)
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California 
place on the Upper East Side.

The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately 
decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's 
description of each of the men at the table.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in 
a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences 
between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van 
Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the 
best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a 
bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten 
keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . 

VAN PATTEN 
What are the rules for a sweater vest?

McDERMOTT 
What do you mean?

PRICE 
Yes. Clarify.

McDERMOTT 
Well, is it strictly informal-

BATEMAN 
Or can it be worn with a suit?

McDERMOTT 
(Smiling) 
Exactly

BATEMAN 
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or 
charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder 
vest.

McDERMOTT 
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or
tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look 
too studied.

VAN PATTEN 
You think so?

PRICE 
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.

VAN PATTEN 
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.

Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy 
discreetly removes their largely untouched plates.

BATEMAN 
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

PRICE 
It looks that way, doesn't it?

McDERMOTT 
(Staring at retreating waiter) 
Did he just take our plates away?

PRICE 
He took them away because the portions are so small he 
probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. 
This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?

McDERMOTT 
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head.
(He guffaws)

Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him.

McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man
with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Is that Reed Robinson over there?
PRICE 
Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.

McDERMOTT 
Who is it then?

PRICE 
That's Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the
room. Over there.

He points to another handsome young man with slicked-back 
hair and horn-rimmed glasses.

McDERMOTT 
Who is he with?

PRICE 
(Distracted by the waitress's 
cleavage as she bends over to 
uncork a bottle of wine  the 
waitress glares at him) 
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

Van Patten returns.

VAN PATTEN 
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.

McDERMOTT 
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?

PRICE 
Yes. McDufus, I am.

McDERMOTT 
He's handling the Fisher account.

PRICE 
Lucky bastard.

McDERMOTT 
Lucky Jew bastard.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with 
anything?

McDERMOTT 
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the
phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The 
bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.

BATEMAN 
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. 
You spin a dreidel.

McDERMOTT 
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?

BATEMAN 
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

McDERMOTT 
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the 
ACLU.

Price leans over and pats Bateman on the back.

PRICE 
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking 
of reasonable...

He shows McDermott the bill for the meal.

McDERMOTT 
Only $470.

VAN PATTEN 
(Without irony) 
Not bad.

The others murmur agreement. Four platinum Amex cards slap
down on the table.

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes. Price is 
lighting up a cigar.

McDERMOTT 
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-

VAN PATTEN 
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this 
story again.

McDERMOTT 
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So 
okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big 
tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I 
buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on 
spring break and she's practically blowing me in the 
Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-

BATEMAN 
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all 
this?

McDERMOTT 
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick 
who's gonna let me-

VAN PATTEN 
(Putting his hands over his ears) 
I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something 
disgusting.

McDERMOTT 
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op 
together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some 
chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.

Price throws a cigar at McDermott, who catches it.

McDERMOTT 
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to 
this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking 
rhino tipsy, and get this-

VAN PATTEN 
She let you fuck her without a condom?

McDERMOTT 
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She 
would only-are you ready? 
(Dramatic pause) 
She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept 
her glove on.

The men sit in shocked, horrified silence.

ALL IN UNISON Never date a Vassar girl.

EXT. TUNNEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the Tunnel. 
McDermott holds the door open for a passing HOMELESS MAN, 
who looks confused.

McDERMOTT 
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask 
him if he takes American Express.

PRICE 
(Offering card) 
You take Amex, dude?

The man stumbles away. The club DOORMAN, seeing the limousine, 
unhooks the 
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.

INT. LADIES ROOM, TUNNEL - NIGHT 

Brilliant white light, a bemused elderly female attendant in a 
black-and-white maid's uniform trying to give out paper towels. 
MUSIC thuds through an open doorway. Trashed-looking girls 
stare into mirrors repairing their eye make-up or sit on the 
counter chatting to friends. There are almost as many men as 
women in the room. Couples stand in line, twitching as they 
wait to do coke. As soon as one bathroom door opens, a couple 
lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes 
past them and slams the door.

PRICE 
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the 
AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, 
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular 
dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for 
Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-

BATEMAN 
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a 
virus.

PRICE 
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.

Price and Bateman finally get a stall and rush in. Price is 
sweating.

PRICE 
I'm shaking. You open it.

Bateman opens a tiny packet of coke.

PRICE
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?

BATEMAN 
Maybe it's just the light.

PRICE 
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips 
the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) 
Oh my God...

BATEMAN 
What?

PRICE 
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

Bateman dips his Amex in the envelope and snorts.

BATEMAN 
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do 
enough of it we'll be okay.

PRICE 
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it 
on my fucking All-Bran.

The GUY IN STALL next door yells at them in an effeminate 
voice:

GUY IN STALL 
Could you keep it down, I'm trying to do drugs!

Price pounds his fist against the stall.

PRICE 
(screaming) 
SHUT UP!

BATEMAN 
Calm down. Let's do it anyway

PRICE 
I guess you're right...
(Raising his voice) 
THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!

GUY IN STALL 
Fuck you!

PRICE 
(Trying to climb up against the aluminum divider) 
No, FUCK YOU!! 
(He collapses, panting against the stall door) 
Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.

BATEMAN 
That's the spirit.

They both dig their platinum Amex cards into the envelope 
of white powder, shoveling it up their noses, then sticking 
their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it into 
their gums.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

Bateman saunters toward the bar as "Pump Up the Volume" 
plays in the background.

BATEMAN (to BARGIRL) Two Stoli on the rocks.

He hands her two drink tickets.

BARGIRL 
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's 
a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.

Bateman pulls out an expensive-looking wallet and hands her 
a $50.

She turns her back and searches the cash register for 
change.

BATEMAN You are a fucking ugly bitch I want to stab to 
death and then play around with your blood.

The music muffles his voice. She turns around. He is 
smiling at her. She gives him his change impassively.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT- MORNING 

Tableaux of Bateman's apartment in the early morning light. 
A huge white living room with floor-to-ceiling windows 
looking out over Manhattan, decorated in expensive, minimalist 
high style: bleached oak floors, a huge white sofa, a large 
Baselitz painting (hung upside down) and much expensive 
electronic equipment. The room is impeccably neat, and oddly 
impersonal - as if it had sprung straight from the pages of 
a design magazine.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am 
twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden 
Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh 
floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.

Bateman walks into his bathroom, urinates while trying to 
see his reflection in a poster for Les Miserables above his 
toilet.

BATEMAN 
(V.0.) I believe in taking care of myself, in a 
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the 
morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice 
pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand 
now.

Bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face.

Bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living 
room wearing the ice pack.

CUT TO:

A mirror-lined bathroom. Bateman is luxuriating in the 
shower steam, scrubbing his body, admiring his muscles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep 
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a 
water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body 
scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.

Bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a 
gel facial masque.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which 
I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my 
routine.

Bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet, which is 
stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products. He 
begins selecting bottles jars and brushes, laying them in 
readiness on the marble counter.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I always use an after-shave lotion with little 
or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes 
you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye 
balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...

Bateman stares into the mirror. The masque has dried, 
giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been 
wrapped in plastic. He begins slowly peeling the gel masque 
off his face.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some 
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an 
entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold 
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you 
and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably 
comparable: I simply am not there.

INT. BATEMAN BEDROOM - MORNING 

Another huge white room, equally minimal: a futon, rumpled 
white sheets, a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb, and a large 
expensive painting (Eric Fischl or David Salle) chosen by 
Bateman's interior decorator.

Dressed in silk boxer shorts, Bateman stands in front of a 
huge walk-in closet, filled with rows of expensive shirts, 
shoes and designer suits, organized according to color and 
tone.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
It is hard for me to make sense on any given 
level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality 
is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is 
persistent.

Fully dressed in Armani, Bateman stands in front of a 
full-length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom, 
adjusting his cuff-links.

BATEMAN (V.0.) 
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared 
a long time ago, if they ever did exist.

He gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees. 
He gives his reflection a smile.

INT. OFFICES OF PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY 

As Bateman walks down the corridor, he passes another MAN who 
looks just like him.

MAN 
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

Bateman walks past the desk of JEAN, his secretary, pulling 
his Walkman from around his neck. Jean is attractive, 
wholesome, earnest. She smiles shyly. She loves him.

JEAN 
Late?

BATEMAN 
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

JEAN 
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what 
he was canceling or why.

BATEMAN 
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. 
Anyone else?

JEAN 
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.

BATEMAN 
When?

JEAN 
After six.

BATEMAN 
Negative. Cancel it.

Jean follows him into his office.

JEAN 
Oh? And what should I say?

BATEMAN
Just...say...no.

JEAN 
Just say no?

Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions.

BATEMAN 
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols 
at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All 
right?

JEAN 
(Playfully) 
Yes, sir.

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight 
tonight.

Jean turns around.

JEAN 
Oh, something. . romantic?

BATEMAN 
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.

JEAN 
I'll do it.

BATEMAN 
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?

JEAN 
You look nice today.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his 
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a 
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a 
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a 
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment 
later with the Perrier and a file.

JEAN 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that 
outfit again.

JEAN 
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.

BATEMAN 
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a 
dress. A skirt or something.

Jean stands there, then looks down at herself.

JEAN 
(Smiling bravely) 
You don't like this, I take it?

BATEMAN 
Come on, you're prettier than that.

JEAN 
(Sarcastically) 
Thanks, Patrick.

The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.

As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner 
of the room and starts watching Jeopardy!

INT. TAXI - EVENING 

EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's 
fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping 
a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically 
beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with 
herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a 
small child.

EVELYN 
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd 
want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something 
ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots 
of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring 
out the window.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm trying to listen to the new George 
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing 
in my ear.

Evelyn continues to make notes.

EVELYN 
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. 
Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. 
And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.

BATEMAN 
(Removing his Walkman) 
Do...what.

EVELYN 
Get married. Have a wedding.

BATEMAN 
Evelyn?

EVELYN 
Yes, darling?

BATEMAN 
Is your Evian spiked?

EVELYN 
We should do it.

BATEMAN 
No-I can't take the time off work.

EVELYN 
Your father practically owns the company. You can do 
anything you like, silly.

BATEMAN 
I don't want to talk about it.

EVELYN 
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just 
quit? You don't have to work.

BATEMAN 
Because I...want...to...fit...in.

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in 
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed 
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel 
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are 
made of extremely uncomfortable 
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace 
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, 
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are 
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, 
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with 
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus 
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE 
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long 
kiss.

PRICE 
I have to talk to you.

He drags her away, half giggling and protesting.

EVELYN 
(Over her shoulder) 
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden 
and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.

BATEMAN 
(After smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and 
checking his hair) 
Hi. Pat Bateman.

Vanden takes his hand reluctantly, says nothing.

BATEMAN 
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH 
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. 
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from 
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is 
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is 
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a 
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He 
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and 
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, 
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, 
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY 
(Whispering) 
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is 
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching 
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn 
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s 
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight 
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, 
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, 
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is 
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I read that.

PRICE 
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN 
Hey. That affects us.

PRICE 
(Wired on coke) 
Oh ho ho. That affects us? What 
about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that 
affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri 
Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of 
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

BATEMAN 
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important 
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign 
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems 
at hand.

PRICE 
Like what?

BATEMAN 
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow 
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world 
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We 
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We 
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and 
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while 
also promoting equal rights for women but change the 
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still 
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN 
We also have to control the influx of illegal 
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional 
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in 
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have 
to promote general social concern and less materialism in 
young people.

Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and 
mystified.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, how thought-provoking.

INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING 

Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television.

BATEMAN 
Why don t you just go for Price?

EVELYN 
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?

BATEMAN 
He's rich.

EVELYN 
Everybody's rich.

BATEMAN 
He's good-looking.

EVELYN 
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
He has a great body

EVELYN 
Everybody has a great body now.

Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get 
Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the 
Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, 
he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to 
look around him at the TV, then takes notice.

EVELYN 
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?

Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television.

EVELYN 
Are you using minoxidil?

BATEMAN 
No. I'm not. Why should I ?

EVELYN 
Your hairline looks like it's receding.

BATEMAN 
It's not.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 

It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the 
comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. 
Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk 
past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his 
wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up 
to her as she pauses at a red light.

BATEMAN 
Hello.

The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing 
his smile, smiles back.

INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 

Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit 
with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry 
cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait...
you're not giving me valid reasons.

The woman continues to speak to him in another language, 
grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket.

BATEMAN 
What are you trying to say to me?

Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained 
sheets out of the bag and is staring at them.

BATEMAN 
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? 
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.

She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking.

BATEMAN 
(Talking over her) 
Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. 
Two.
(Louder) 
Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very 
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN 
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill 
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN 
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting 
(Checks Rolex) 
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those 
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at 
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need 
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with 
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN 
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA, 
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a 
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA 
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA 
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

BATEMAN 
Hello 
(Mumbles un incomprehensible name)

Awkward pause.

BATEMAN 
Well.

VICTORIA 
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, 
but you
know. They really are the best.

BATEMAN 
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk 
to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

Victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding 
up. She
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking 
again.

VICTORIA 
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.
BATEMAN 
Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.

VICTORiA 
(Skeptically) Really?

BATEMAN 
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You 
know, like...
like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?

VICTORIA 
(As if sharing a secret joke) Oh yeah. Oh I get it. 
Fun with chocolate.

BATEMAN 
Listen, if you could talk to them 
(He yanks the sheet out of the man's hand) 
I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a 
lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.

Bateman turns to leave.

VICTORIA 
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?

BATEMAN 
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank 
you, uh...
Victoria?

VICTORIA 
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You 
know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.

BATEMAN 
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the 
time.

VICTORIA 
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?

BATEMAN 
(Checking his watch) 
Next Saturday?

VICTORIA 
(Shrugging) 
Yeah.

BATEMAN 
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. 
Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call 
you.

VICTORIA 
Okay. Do.

Bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes 
out the door. Victoria stares after him as we hear the sound 
of the bell on the closing door.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video, talking to 
Courtney on a portable phone. He's holding a video box in one 
hand, perusing the title: Inside Lydia's Ass. Offscreen we hear 
the sounds of the porn movie as he talks.

BATEMAN 
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

COURTNEY 
What? Oh, I'm...busy.

BATEMAN 
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, 
and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to 
tonight?

COURTNEY 
Stop it. I'm...

BATEMAN 
On a lot of lithium?

COURTNEY 
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call 
tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
You should come have dinner with me.
COURTNEY 
But-when?

BATEMAN 
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?

COURTNEY 
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I 
need to be
home for that.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin?

COURTNEY 
Yes?

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.

COURTNEY 
Uh huh.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New 
York.

COURTNEY 
I know. Stop it.

BATEMAN 
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling 
dickweed.

COURTNEY 
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.

BATEMAN 
Courtney? Dinner?

COURTNEY 
I can't.

BATEMAN 
I'm thinking Dorsia.

COURTNEY 
Dorsia's nice.

BATEMAN 
Nice?

COURTNEY 
You like it there, don't you?

BATEMAN 
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will 
you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a 
boyfriend to eat there tonight.

COURTNEY 
Okay. Yeah. What time?

BATEMAN 
Eight? 

COURTNEY 
Pick me up? 

BATEMAN 
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear 
something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?

Bateman hangs up, opens up the Zagat's guide and dials the 
number for Dorsia with trembling fingers. It's busy and so 
he puts it on speakerphone, constant redial. He waits with 
his head in his hands, sweating with anxiety, until there 
is finally an answer.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia. Please hold.

He is on hold for a long time, getting very tense.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia.

BATEMAN 
(Both of his eyes are closed) 
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to 
reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?

Long pause. The Maitre D' starts giggling quietly and then 
more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he 
hangs up the phone.

INT. TAXI- NIGHT

Bateman and Courtney are in the back of a cab. Courtney is
heavily medicated.

COURTNEY 
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really 
relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this 
silver muffin dish. 
(She starts to pass out)

BATEMAN 
Is that Donald Trump's car?

COURTNEY 
(Thickly) 
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

BATEMAN 
You know, Courtney, you should take some more 
lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you 
out of this slump.

COURTNEY 
I just want to have a child. Just...two...
perfect...children...
(Her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze)

The cab draws up outside a restaurant. The awning reads 
"Barcadia."

INT. BARCADIA - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Italian restaurant all 
polished natural brick, spotless white tablecloths, 
minimalist flower arrangements, discreet lighting.

A waiter has come to take their drink orders.

BATEMAN
J&B. Straight.

COURTNEY 
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with 
a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman 
leans over and pulls her back up.

COURTNEY 
Are we here?

BATEMAN 
Yes.

COURTNEY 
This is Dorsia?

BATEMAN 
(Examining a menu that says "Barcadia" in large script) 
Yes, dear.

Courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu, and 
starts to slide off of her chair. Bateman grabs her by both 
shoulders and props her up.

BATEMAN 
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter 
soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine 
called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll 
love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and 
pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. 

COURTNEY 
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick. 

She falls asleep at the table.

INT. COURTNEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Bateman and Courtney are in Courtney's bed. Bateman is on 
top of her, reaching for a condom in the ashtray. He tears 
it open with his teeth, puts it on.

COURTNEY 
(Dazed on lithium) 
I want you to fuck me.

Bateman gets on top of her, starts to fuck her.

COURTNEY 
Luis is a despicable twit.

BATEMAN 
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.

He keeps fucking her.

COURTNEY 
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" 
Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? 
Get off me.

BATEMAN 
Is it a what?

COURTNEY 
Pull out.

BATEMAN 
I'm ignoring you.

COURTNEY 
(screaming) 
Pull out, goddamnit!

BATEMAN 
(Slowing down but not stopping)
What do you want, Courtney?

She pushes him away from her.

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end. I think.

COURTNEY 
Turn the light on.

She tries to sit up.

BATEMAN 
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.

COURTNEY 
Patrick. Turn on the Light.
He turns on the light. 

BATEMAN 
It's a plain end, see? So? 

COURTNEY 
Take it off. 

BATEMAN 
Why? 

COURTNEY 
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip  
(She covers herself with her comforter) 
to catch the force of the ejaculate! 
BATEMAN 
I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?

Courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying. 

COURTNEY 
(Screaming) 
Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?

Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face.

BATEMAN 
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, 
Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. 
(He slaps her again lightly) 
Why is it pulled down half an inch? 
So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!

COURTNEY 
(Choking crying) 
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. 
I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom.

BATEMAN 
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?

COURTNEY 
Oh God, just get it over with.

He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and 
falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their 
bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the 
ceiling.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY

Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in 
the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto 
a spectacular view of Manhattan.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a 
reservation there?

BATEMAN 
Lucky, I guess.

CARRUTHERS 
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, 
Valentino Couture?

BATEMAN 
Uh huh.

CARRUTHERS 
(Reaching out to touch it) 
It looks so soft.

BATEMAN 
(Catching Luis hand) 
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.

Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague 
on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal 
under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and 
self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men.

OWEN 
(To Bateman) 
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?

BATEMAN 
I've been great. And you?

Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's 
thoughts.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. 
It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in 
fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a 
penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. 
Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have 
a slightly better haircut.

During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS 
HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the 
opposite corner of the room. He bears a 
superficial resemblance to Bateman.

OWEN 
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?

BATEMAN 
(Nervous) 
It's...it's...all right.

OWEN 
Really? That's interesting. 
(He stares at Bateman, smiling)
Not great?

BATEMAN 
Oh well, you know.

OWEN 
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

BATEMAN 
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.

McDermott and Price enter.

McDERMOTT 
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.

OWEN 
Thank you, Baxter.

PRICE 
Listen, Paul. Squash?

OWEN 
Call me. 
(Hands him a business card)

PRICE 
How about Friday?

OWEN 
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea 
urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away 
and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred.

PRICE
(Whispering) 
Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?

McDERMOTT (Whispering) 
I think he's lying.

Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. 

PRICE 
(Suddenly enthused) 
What's that, a gram? 

BATEMAN 
New card. What do you think?

McDermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully. 

McDERMOTT 
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.

He hands it to Van Patten.

BATEMAN 
Picked them up from the printers yesterday

VAN PATTEN 
Good coloring.

BATEMAN 
That's bone. And the lettering is something called 
Silian Rail.

McDERMOTT 
(Envious) 
Silian Rail?

VAN PATTEN 
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

He pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the 
table. 

VAN PATTEN 
Look at this.

They all lean forward to inspect it. 

PRICE 
That's really nice.

Bateman clenches his fists beneath the table, trying to 
control his anxiety.

VAN PATTEN 
Eggshell with Romalian type. 
(Turning to Bateman)
What do you think?

BATEMAN 
(Barely able to breath, his voice a croak) 
Nice.

PRICE 
(Holding the card up to the light) 
Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so 
tasteful?

Bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at 
McDermott's. 

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.

PRICE 
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

He holds up his own card. 

PRICE 
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN 
(Choking with anxiety) 
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it 
up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE & PIERCE, 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless. 
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint 
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness 
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it 
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING 

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of 
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns 
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open 
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A 
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM 
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies 
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green 
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN 
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN 
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his 
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN 
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
It's cold out, too, isn't it?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

BATEMAN 
(Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) 
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you 
get a job?

HOMELESS MAN 
(Shivering and sobbing) 
I lost my job...

BATEMAN 
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? 
Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on 
the job?

HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off.

BATEMAN 
Gee, uh, that's too bad.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

The dog starts to whimper.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm not...

BATEMAN 
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry

BATEMAN 
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. 
I'm trying to help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm hungry.

BATEMAN 
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who 
do have jobs? From people who do work?

HOMELESS MAN 
What am I gonna do?

BATEMAN 
Listen, what's your name?

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Speak up. Come on.

HOMELESS MAN
Al.

BATEMAN 
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. 
That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. 
I'll help you.

HOMELESS MAN 
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind
man. I can tell.

BATEMAN 
(Petting the dog) 
Shhhh...it's okay.

HOMELESS MAN 
(Grabbing Bateman's wrist) 
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.

BATEMAN 
(Stroking his face, whispering) 
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.

HOMELESS MAN 
I can't...I can't find a shelter

BATEMAN 
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? 
(Shouting)
Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of 
faggot. Al...I'm sorry.

Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet.

BATEMAN 
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common 
with you.

He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with 
a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to 
protect it.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?

HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife.

EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure
is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach.
The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is 
silent.

LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground.

BATEMAN
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.

Bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of Wall Street. 
Cars drift past, their headlights momentarily illuminating the 
body left twitching on the ground.

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY 

CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face and torso. His eyes are closed as a 
woman's hands rub cream into his face.

FACIALIST 
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So 
fine, so smooth...

His eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he 
closes them again.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, 
skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except 
for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside 
me and I don't know why.

CUT TO:

Bateman sitting in a chair, looking down at the 
MANICURIST who is giving him a pedicure. She is cutting his 
nails with tiny sharp scissors. He stares at them longingly.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, 
on the verge of frenzy.

CUT TO:

Bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning 
bed, wearing goggles.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

INT. TEXARKANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

An insanely expensive nouvelle Tex-Mex restaurant, with an 
ironic Southwestern decor: Santa Fe colors, Navajo blankets, 
naive cowboy art, rawhide banquettes.

Bateman bursts in the door, late, and approaches the MAITRE D'.

BATEMAN 
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?

MAITRE D'
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.

Paul Owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of 
ram's horns. He is arguing with the WAITER.

OWEN 
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro 
crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one 
could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the 
way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten 
people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of 
cilantro crawfish gumbo?

WAITER 
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen 
earlier today, and-

BATEMAN 
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.

WAITER 
Would you like to hear-

OWEN 
Double Absolut martini.

WAITER 
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?

BATEMAN 
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

The Waiter leaves.

OWEN 
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam. 

This place is hot, very hot.

BATEMAN 
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous 
here.

OWEN 
Yeah, well, you're late.

BATEMAN 
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break 
(Studying the menu; he's in a surprisingly good mood) 
Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.

OWEN 
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.

BATEMAN 
Nobody goes there anymore.

There is a long disgruntled silence.

BATEMAN 
Is that Ivana Trump over there? (Laughs) Jeez 
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana 
be at Texarkana?

Another pause.

BATEMAN 
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the 
Fisher account? How did you get it?

OWEN 
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have 
to kill you.

He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely.

LATER: 
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.

BATEMAN 
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?

Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another 
drink.

OWEN 
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?

BATEMAN Salon.

OWEN 
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.

Bateman nods, agitated.

OWEN 
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?

BATEMAN 
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think 
she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.

OWEN 
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick 
Bateman. What a dork.

BATEMAN 
Another Martini, Paul?

Owen nods drunkenly.

LATER:

The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the 
table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid 
down.

BATEMAN 
(Talking to Owen like a child) 
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.

BATEMAN 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave 
a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?

OWEN 
No, man. I'm gonna bail.

BATEMAN 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. 
(Helping him into his jacket) 
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a 
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with 
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass 
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN 
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN 
They're okay.
BATEMAN 
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN 
(Said partly from the bathroom) 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN 
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys 
catalogue.

OWEN 
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Owen?

OWEN 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over 
the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?

BATEMAN 
No, Owen.

OWEN 
(Confused) 
Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN 
Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its 
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN 
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the 
ax raised over his head.

BATEMAN 
Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing 
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame. 
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

BATEMAN 
(Raising the ax and screaming) 
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking 
stupid bastard!

LOW ANGLE ON BATEMAN as he beats Owen with the back of the 
ax.

OFFSCREEN, the sound of the ax hitting Owen.

BATEMAN 
(Panting) 
Fucking bastard...

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the 
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly 
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He 
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 

BATEMAN drags a large, blood-soaked sleeping bag through the lobby, 
past the bored doorman, who looks up from the Post for a moment.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

BATEMAN is trying to hail a cab. Owen's body is at his 
feet. Luis Carruthers and a Japanese girl walk up to him.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.

CARRUTHERS 
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good 
friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to 
Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it. 
(Looking down at the body) 
Where did you get your overnight bag?

BATEMAN 
Commes des Garcon.

A cab stops. BATEMAN opens the door and manages to get 
Owen's body into the backseat.

Bateman gets into the cab.

CARRUTHERS 
Call me please, Patrick.

BATEMAN 
Jesus lives, Luis.

INT. BATEMAN'S HELL'S KITCHEN APARTMENT - NIGHT 

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank 
except for a Les Miserables poster. There is one ratty chair.

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in 
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the 
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very 
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls 
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting 
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale 
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN 
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN 
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans 
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

BATEMAN 
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London 
for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. 
Hasta la vista, baby.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING 

Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of 
Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing 
Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes 
the Walkman off.

BATEMAN 
(Faintly irritable) 
What is it?

JEAN 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
(Condescendingly) 
Ye-es, Je-an?

JEAN 
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.

BATEMAN 
Who?

JEAN 
Detective Donald KIMBALL?

Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the 
drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back 
cover of Sports Illustrated.

BATEMAN 
Tell him I'm at lunch.

JEAN 
(whispering) 
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. 
It's only ten-thirty. 

Silence. 

BATEMAN 
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless 
phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.

BATEMAN 
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion 
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good 
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt 
calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD 
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - 
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of 
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a 
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to 
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at 
him curiously, noticing the silence.

BATEMAN 
(Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) 
Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.

Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in 
exasperation. 

KIMBALL nods understandingly.

BATEMAN 
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just 
walked in...
(He laughs inanely) 
Just joking...
(Pause) 
No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, 
right, got it. 
(He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) 
Sorry about that.

KIMBALL 
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. 
(Gesturing toward the phone) 
Was that anything important?

BATEMAN 
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. 
Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors...
Spreading gossip.

They laugh politely.

KIMBALL 
(Holding out his hand) 
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL

BATEMAN 
(Shaking firmly) 
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

KIMBALL 
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed 
to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, 
you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.

KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports 
Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. 
Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines 
into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is 
still running.

BATEMAN 
(Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) 
So, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate 
the disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?

KIMBALL 
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.

BATEMAN 
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.

KIMBALL 
So it's nothing that official. I just have some 
basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-

BATEMAN 
Coffee?

KIMBALL 
No. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
Perrier? San Pellegrino?

KIMBALL 
No, I'm okay.

KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold 
Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes 
Jean.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Can you bring Mr...

KIMBALL 
KIMBALL.

BATEMAN 
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-

KIMBALL 
Oh no, I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
It's no problem

Bateman watches intently as KIMBALL writes something down 
in his notebook, then crosses something out. Jean enters 
and places the bottle of San Pellegrino and a Steuben etched 
glass on the table, shooting a concerned glance at Bateman. 
He glares at her. KIMBALL smiles and nods at Jean as she leaves.

BATEMAN 
Well, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL 
The disappearance of Paul Owen.

BATEMAN 
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the 
disappearance or anything...
(Trying to laugh) 
Not on "Page Six" at least.

KIMBALL 
I think his family wants this kept quiet.

BATEMAN 
Understandable. 
(Staring at the untouched bottle of San Pellegrino) 
Lime?

KIMBALL 
No, really. I'm okay.

BATEMAN 
You sure? I can always get you a lime.

A pause.

KIMBALL
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own 
files, okay?

BATEMAN 
Shoot.

KIMBALL 
How old are you?

BATEMAN 
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.

KIMBALL 
(Scribbling in his notebook) 
Where did you go to school?

BATEMAN 
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

KIMBALL 
Your address?

BATEMAN 
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American
Gardens Building.

KIMBALL 
(Looking up, impressed) 
Nice. Very nice.

BATEMAN 
(Flattered) 
Thanks.

A pause as KIMBALL studies his notebook. Bateman closes his
eyes, as if in pain.

KIMBALL 
Pardon me, but are you okay?

BATEMAN 
Who do you ask?

KIMBALL
You seem...nervous.

Bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a 
bottle of aspirin.

BATEMAN 
Nuprin?

KIMBALL Uh...no, thanks.

Kimball takes out a pack of Marlboro's and lays it on the 
desk.

BATEMAN 
Bad habit.

KIMBALL 
I know. I'm sorry.

A pause, as Bateman stares at the cigarettes.

KIMBALL 
Would you rather I not smoke?

BATEMAN 
No, I guess it's okay.

KIMBALL 
You sure?

BATEMAN 
No problem. 
(Buzzing Jean)

JEAN (O.S.) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please.
She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.

KIMBALL 
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
Well...

He coughs, shakes two Nuprin into his hand and swallows 
them dry.

KIMBALL 
How well did you know him?

BATEMAN 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, 
you know.

KIMBALL 
Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Yeah...Yale thing.

KIMBALL 
What do you mean...Yale thing?

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet 
homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.

A silence during which the sound of the air conditioner 
becomes deafening.

KIMBALL 
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul 
Owen?

BATEMAN 
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He...
ate a balanced diet.

KIMBALL 
What kind of man was he? Besides...
(He hesitates tries to smile) 
the information you've just given.

BATEMAN 
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

KIMBALL 
Do you feel that way?

BATEMAN 
No. Not really.

KIMBALL 
(As he writes without looking up) 
Where did Paul hang out?

BATEMAN 
Hang...out?

KIMBALL 
Yeah. You know...hang out.

BATEMAN 
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine.
Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular 
places.

KIMBALL 
He had a yacht?

BATEMAN 
No, he just hung out there.

KIMBALL 
And where did he go to school?

A slight pause.

BATEMAN 
Don't you know this?

KIMBALL 
I just wanted to know if you know.
BATEMAN 
Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's...
Listen, I just...I just want to help.

KIMBALL 
I understand.

He makes another note.

KIMBALL 
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?

BATEMAN 
We were both seven in 1969.

KIMBALL 
(Smiles) 
So was I.

BATEMAN 
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

KIMBALL 
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he 
went to London.

BATEMAN 
Well, maybe he did, huh?

KIMBALL 
His girlfriend doesn't think so.

BATEMAN 
But...has anyone seen him in London?

KIMBALL 
Actually, yes.

BATEMAN 
Hmmm.

KIMBALL 
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. 
A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but 
I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert 
Ainsworth for Paul, so...

BATEMAN 
Oh.

KIMBALL 
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan
worship?

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I 
know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't 
know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was 
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano 
girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-

BATEMAN 
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced 
diet and-

KIMBALL 
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.

A pause - the longest so far.

BATEMAN 
Have you consulted a psychic?

KIMBALL 
No.

BATEMAN 
Had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL 
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A 
suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.

BATEMAN 
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet 
or anything, right?

KIMBALL 
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But...
basically no one has seen or heard anything.

BATEMAN 
That's so typical, isn't it?

KIMBALL 
It's just strange. 
(He stares out the window, lost in thought) 
One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, 
and then...

BATEMAN 
Nothing.

KIMBALL 
People just...disappear.

BATEMAN 
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
(He checks his Rolex)

KIMBALL 
Eerie. Really eerie.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
(Standing up) 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting 
with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.

KIMBALL 
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I 
mean aren't you going to be late?

BATEMAN 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.

KIMBALL 
Oh really? I didn't know that.

Bateman leads him to the door.

BATEMAN 
Yes. It's very good.

KIMBALL turns to face him.

KIMBALL 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information 
at all...

BATEMAN 
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.

KIMBALL 
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.

Bateman closes the door firmly on KIMBALL. He closes his 
eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 

A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, 
a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect 
green grapes, a few berries.

OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard 
from the living room.

The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal 
crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, 
next to a copy of GQ.

LATER:

Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, 
jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing.

BATEMAN 
You like that, slut?

The person on the other end clearly hangs up.

CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone.

BATEMAN 
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar 
boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white 
cotton T-shirt by 
Commes des Garcons. 
(He snorts like a pig) 
My Rolex cost-

Another hang-up. He dials again.

BATEMAN 
(Whipering) 
I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do 
you think of that? 
(Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) 
Huh, bitch?

GIRL (O.S.)
Dad, is that you?

Bateman hangs up, frustrated.

EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 

Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside 
CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. 
Bateman opens his window to speak to her.

BATEMAN 
I haven't seen you around here.

CHRISTIE 
You just haven't been looking.

BATEMAN 
Would you like to see my apartment?

Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a 
tuxedo.

CHRISTIE 
(looking away to some dark corner) 
I'm not supposed to.

Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now 
notices, then takes.

BATEMAN 
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?

CHRISTIE 
I'm not supposed to. 
(She pockets the bill) 
But I can make an exception.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie is still looking out behind her.

BATEMAN 
Do you take American Express?

Christie looks at him like he's crazy.

BATEMAN 
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He 
reads off a credit card number.

BATEMAN 
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does 
couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the 
American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really 
can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.

He hangs up.

BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? 
You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is 
that clear?

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white 
milky bath oil.

BATEMAN 
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and 
Bateman is casually touching her breast.

BATEMAN 
I want you to clean your vagina.

Christie reaches for a washcloth.

BATEMAN 
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.

The doorman RINGS. Bateman answers.

BATEMAN 
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry 
off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and 
our guest in the living room for drinks.

Bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN 
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. 
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

The escort girl looks somewhat bewildered. Bateman takes 
her coat and inspects her body and face.

BATEMAN 
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm 
going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.

Bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a 
glass of wine. Christie enters, sitting next to Sabrina on the 
couch, and Bateman sits across from them. There is a 
long silence.

BATEMAN 
So, don't you want to know what I do?

The two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles. 
Christie shrugs.

CHRISTIE 
No.

SABRINA 
(Smiling) 
No, not really.

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN 
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce. 
(Long pause) 
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands 
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE 
You have a really nice place here...Paul. 
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN 
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, 
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a 
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN 
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN 
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina 
takes one.

BATEMAN 
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very 
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. 
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN 
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis 
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before 
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too 
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' 
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out 
another one.

BATEMAN 
I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed
masterpiece.

He puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him 
into the bedroom.

BATEMAN 
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the 
same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding 
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.

Bateman puts out a lace teddy. He motions to Christie to 
put it on.

BATEMAN 
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, 
Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance 
of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.

Bateman starts to undress.

BATEMAN 
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer 
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. 
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

Sabrina dances awkwardly. Christie sits on the bed.

BATEMAN 
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this 
song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political 
authority.

Bateman knots a silk scarf around Christie's neck - rather 
menacingly - then helps her into some suede gloves. 

BATEMAN 
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about 
monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. 
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything 
I've heard in rock.

He turns on the video camera. 

BATEMAN 
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your 
asshole.

Bateman looks through the viewfinder.

BATEMAN 
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and 
therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially 
songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against 
All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. 

He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in 
the CD.

BATEMAN 
But I also think that Phill Collins works better 
within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and 
I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, 
great song, a personal favorite.

SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or 
through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA.

CUT TO: 

Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina 
on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his 
wrist. Bateman's eyes open.

BATEMAN 
Don't touch the Rolex.

Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire.

He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, 
a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns 
around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up 
and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger.

BATEMAN 
We're not through yet...

CUT TO:

Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They 
are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a 
deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the 
b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing.

INT. YALE CLUB  DAY
 
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are 
having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and 
gives them the finger.

BATEMAN 
What an asshole.

McDERMOTT 
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a 
fucking drug addict. No self-control.

VAN PATTEN 
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do 
you think, Bateman?

BATEMAN 
I know her. I knew her.

McDERMOTT 
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it 
like that?

VAN PATTEN 
Because he dated her.

BATEMAN 
How did you guess?

VAN PATTEN 
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, 
Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy 
personality.

McDERMOTT 
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a 
babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other 
reason.

VAN PATTEN 
If they have a good personality, then something 
is very wrong.

McDERMOTT 
If they have a good personality and they are not 
great looking-who fucking cares?

BATEMAN 
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if 
they have a good personality? 
(He smiles giving up) 
I know, I know-

ALL IN UNISON
There are no girls with good personalities! 
(They laugh and high-five each other)

VAN PATTEN 
A good personality consists of a chick with a 
little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without 
being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep 
her dumb fucking mouth 
shut.

McDERMOTT 
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are
smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even 
talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly 
chicks.

VAN PATTEN 
Absolutely.

McDERMOTT 
And this is because they have to make up for how 
fucking unattractive they are.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?

VAN PATTEN 
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

BATEMAN 
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was 
an interesting guy.

McDERMOTT 
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN 
He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the 
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her 
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat 
her right."

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT 
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN 
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back 
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS 
(Shyly) 
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you 
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to 
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone 
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear 
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously. 
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with 
himself.

VAN PATTEN 
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN 
(Suddenly angry) 
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about 
fucking dinner?" 

McDERMOTT 
Ah, cheer up, Bateman. 
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) 
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? 

BATEMAN 
(Watching Luis going into the men's room) 
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT 
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN 
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van 
Patten grabs a waiter.

VAN PATTEN 
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring 
me an Evian or something, okay?

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 

Bateman pulls on his gloves as he 
enters the men's room. Carruthers is standing in a stall with his 
back to Bateman. The sound of his urinating is heard until Bateman 
approaches, then abruptly stops. Slowly, Bateman brings his hands 
up over the collar of Carruthers' cashmere jacket, circling his 
neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet. All we can hear 
is the sound of Bateman's heavy breathing. Slowly he starts to 
squeeze. Almost in slow motion, Carruthers turns around.

Carruthers looks down at Bateman's wrists as if lost in 
thought. Then he lowers his head and kisses Bateman's 
wrist. He looks back at Bateman with a shy, love-struck 
expression, then reaches up and tenderly touches the side 
of his face.

CARRUTHERS 
God, Patrick. Why here?

He strokes Bateman's hair.

CARRUTHERS 
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.

Carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but Bateman backs 
away. He drops his hands from Carruthers' neck. Carruthers 
immediately takes them and places them back. Bateman drops 
them again.

CARRUTHERS 
Don't be shy.

Bateman takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and tries to lift 
his hands again, but abandons the attempt.

CARRUTHERS 
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas 
party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that 
red-striped paisley Armani tie.

Bateman looks down and sees that Carruthers' pants are 
still unzipped. He moves past him out of the stall and 
stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he 
realizes he still has his gloves on. Carruthers comes up 
behind him.

CARRUTHERS 
I want you. I want you...too.

Bateman storms out of the men's room, bumping into a waiter 
and several customers and cursing. Noticing the maitre d' 
and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely, 
Bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at 
them. Carruthers walks up behind him.

BATEMAN 
(Hissing) 
What...is...it?

CARRUTHERS 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
(Stumbling away from him) 
I've gotta...I've 
gotta...return some videotapes.

CARRUTHERS 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
What?
CARRUTHERS 
(Silently mouthing the words) 
I'll call you.

Bateman storms out of the restaurant.

INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. 
Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels 
something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, 
a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence.

COURTNEY 
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?

BATEMAN 
Maybe.

Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her 
nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins 
to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches 
the TV at low volume.

COURTNEY 
What are you doing tonight?

BATEMAN 
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

COURTNEY 
That's nice.

BATEMAN 
You and...Luis?

COURTNEY 
(Lighting a cigarette) 
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and 
Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...

BATEMAN 
I never knew you smoked.

COURTNEY 
(Smiling sadly) 
You never noticed.

Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie.

COURTNEY 
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?

BATEMAN 
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're 
going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.

COURTNEY 
(Sarcastically) 
Isn't that special? 
(A pause) 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Courtney?

C0URTNEY 
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?

BATEMAN 
(Flatly) 
You too.

Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its 
head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door.

COURTNEY 
Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Yes?

COURTNEY 
Nothing.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 

A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop 
kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies.

I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and 
tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a 
suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him.

KIMBALL 
Mr. Bateman?

Bateman gasps and recovers.

BATEMAN 
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
KIMBALL 
Kimball. 
(Extending his hand) 
Call me Don.

BATEMAN 
Don.

KIMBALL 
So...you hang out here a lot?

BATEMAN 
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You 
know.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone 
in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks 
in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)

KIMBALL 
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?

BATEMAN 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at his glass) 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much 
more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, 
don't you think?

Bateman is nodding nervously, idiotically.

KIMBALL 
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?

Bateman shakes his head.

KIMBALL 
I mean they want to get caught.

BATEMAN 
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need 
anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean 
Owen was a...complex man.

Bateman wanders away.

He looks back uneasily at KIMBALL, who is watching him from 
the bar. A GUY WITH DREADLOCKS walks by.

BATEMAN 
(Holding up his hand to high-five) Rasta Man!

The man stares at him.

BATEMAN 
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...

The man walks by, shaking his head.

Bateman wanders into the next room, which is filled with a 
more familiar crowd: young men in designer suits, girls in 
black designer dresses. Across the room he spots McDermott 
and Price sitting with three models, all wearing black 
mini-dresses. Price and McDermott are having a whispered 
argument.

PRICE 
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.

McDERMOTT 
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder. 
You went last time. Stay here.

McDermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
Bateman looks at the models. DAISY and CARON are staring 
into space, smoking. LIBBY is trying to work out how to 
unfold her napkin. Price signals to Bateman for help.

PRICE 
(Clapping his hands together) 
Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?

Silence.

LIBBY 
Where did Craig go?

PRICE 
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to 
sign a peace treaty with him between the United States 
and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.

LIBBY 
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.

PRICE 
You're not confused, are you?

LIBBY 
No, not really.

CARON 
Gorbachev's not downstairs.

DAISY 
(Smiling) 
Are you Iying?

PRICE 
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's 
at Tunnel.

BATEMAN 
(To Daisy) 
Ask me a question.

DAISY 
So, what do you do?

BATEMAN 
What do you think I do?

DAISY 
A model? An actor?

BATEMAN 
No. Flattering, but no.

DAISY 
Well...

BATEMAN 
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.

DAISY (Unfazed) 
Do you like it?

BATEMAN 
Welt...it depends, why?

DAISY 
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and 
acquisitions don't really like it.

Silence.

BATEMAN 
So, where do you work out?

MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING: 

The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a 
balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him 
in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over 
the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman 
is reaching for him.

PRICE 
(Shouting)
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

BATEMAN 
Leaving what?

PRICE 
This.

Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his 
drink.

BATEMAN 
Don't, I'll drink it.

PRICE 
(Screaming) 
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.

BATEMAN 
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?

PRICE 
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!

BATEMAN 
Don't tell me...merchant banking?

PRICE 
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm 
disappearing.

BATEMAN 
(laughing) 
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?

Price looks away.

McDermott and Daisy walk up to them.

McDERMOTT 
Hey-don't worry, be happy.

Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is 
shouting something that can't be heard, then

PRICE 
Goodbye! Fuckheads!

He climbs over the railing.

DAISY What is he doing?

BATEMAN 
Price! Come back!

Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment 
then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd.

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT 
Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab.

DAISY 
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays 
in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand 
what I was doing with a yuppie.

BATEMAN 
Oh really?
DAISY 
He said...
(She laughs) 
He said you gave him bad vibes.

BATEMAN 
That's...that's too bad.

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb, don't you?

BATEMAN 
What?

DAISY 
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.

BATEMAN 
(insincerely) No. I really don't.

DAISY 
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.

She takes his hand as they get into a cab.

INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses 
in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the 
case.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 

Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York 
Times crossword puzzle at dusk.

Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with 
a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her.

JEAN 
Doin' the crossword?

Bateman nods without looking up.

JEAN 
Need help?

BATEMAN doesn't respond. We see that every space on the 
puzzle has been filled in with the words MEAT or BONE. Jean 
drops the folder on his desk and then walks out.

BATEMAN 
Jean?

JEAN 
(Re-enters office) 
Yes, Patrick?

BATEMAN 
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?

He erases one of the M's on the crossword puzzle.

BATEMAN 
That is...if you're not doing anything.

JEAN 
Oh no. I have no plans.

BATEMAN 
(Lowering his Wayfarers) 
Well, isn't this a coincidence.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
Listen, where should we go?

He leans back and pulls a Zagat's from the desk drawer.

JEAN 
Anywhere you want?

BATEMAN 
Let's not think about what I want. How about 
anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.

BATEMAN 
No, come on. Anywhere you want.

JEAN 
Oh, I can't. 
(Sighs) 
I don't know.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want.
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

A long pause.

JEAN 
What about...Dorsia?

Bateman stops looking through the Zagat's guide and smiles 
at her.

BATEMAN 
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...

JEAN 
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

BATEMAN 
Dorsia is...fine.

He dials the number.

MAITRE D'
Dorsia, yes?

BATEMAN 
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at 
nine o'clock?

He checks his Rolex and winks at Jean.

MAITRE D'
We are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Oh really? That's great.

MAITRE D' 
I said we are totally booked.

BATEMAN 
Two at nine? Perfect.

MAITRE D' 
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is 
also totally booked.

BATEMAN 
See you then.

He hangs up the phone. He walks over to the coat rack. He 
glances over at Jean, who is still standing in front of the 
desk, confused.

BATEMAN 
Yes? You're dressed...okay.

JEAN 
You didn't give them a name.

BATEMAN 
They know me.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock 
for drinks, okay?

She turns to leave.

BATEMAN 
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 

Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out.

JEAN 
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.

Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady 
visible.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Sorbet?

JEAN 
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in 
his hand and hands her the sorbet.

Jean is eating the sorbet.

JEAN 
Want a bite?

BATEMAN 
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

JEAN 
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? 
You look great. Very fit.

BATEMAN 
(Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) 
You can always he thinner. Look...better.

JEAN 
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't 
want to ruin your willpower.

BATEMAN 
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling 
it anyway.

Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up 
his knife drawer, looking at the knives.

BATEMAN 
So listen, what do you really want to do with your 
life?

Pause.

BATEMAN 
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, 
okay?

JEAN 
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, 
but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life 
where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so...
I don't know...unsure.

Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge 
of the blade.

BATEMAN 
Do you have a boyfriend?

JEAN 
No, not really.

BATEMAN 
Interesting.

JEAN 
(Shyly) 
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

BATEMAN 
Maybe. I don't know Not really.
Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very 
Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly
ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, 
twine and a nail gun.

BATEMAN 
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?

JEAN 
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused 
on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about 
changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.

BATEMAN 
Growing. I'm glad you said that.

Bateman picks up the duct tape.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, 
was named Lassie? Had you heard this?

JEAN 
Who's Ted Bundy?

BATEMAN 
Forget it.

JEAN 
What's that?

BATEMAN 
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for...
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the 
nail gun.

JEAN 
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?

Jean puts her spoon down on the table.

BATEMAN 
(Looking up from loading nails into the gun) 
What...No! Put it in the carton.

JEAN 
Sorry. 
(She puts the spoon in the carton)

BATEMAN 
Jean? What?

JEAN 
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?

From behind, we follow Bateman as he walks across the room and
stands behind the couch.

BATEMAN 
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just 
want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.

JEAN 
Hmmmm. 

He points the nail gun at the back of Jean's head.
The phone RINGS. Startled, Bateman hides the nail gun 
behind his back. The answering machine picks up. As Bateman 
listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch. 
He sits down opposite Jean, enjoying her discomfort as she 
listens to the message.

EVELYN 
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. 
What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope 
you're not out with some little number you picked up because 
you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never 
called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for 
Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with 
Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, 
auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell 
Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! 
You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.

Silence. Jean is obviously embarrassed and upset.

JEAN 
Was that...Evelyn?

Silence.

JEAN 
Are you still seeing her?

Silence.

JEAN 
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.

Silence.

JEAN 
Do you want me to go?

A long pause.

BATEMAN 
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

JEAN 
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get 
involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you 
want me to go?

Another long pause.

BATEMAN 
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I 
think I might hurt you. 
(Almost hopefully) 
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

JEAN 
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. 
You're right, I should go.

She gets up to leave.

JEAN 
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with 
Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.

BATEMAN 
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.

He sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY 

Bateman enters P&P, walks up the corridor and pauses outside 
the door to his office. He sees KIMBALL in conversation with 
Jean, and Jean looking through her date book. He watches for 
a moment, frozen with anxiety. He then bursts in, shutting 
the door behind him.

BATEMAN 
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come 
into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

Jean looks flustered.

Kimball follows Bateman into his office.

KIMBALL 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's 
taken a leave of absence.

BATEMAN 
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. 
(Hopefully) 
Is he a suspect?

KIMBALL 
Not really.

A pause.

KIMBALL 
Do you remember where you were on the night of 
Paul's disappearance? 
(He checks his notebook) 
Which was on the twentieth of December?

BATEMAN 
God...I guess...I was probably returning 
videotapes.

He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his 
diary.

BATEMAN 
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

KIMBALL 
Wait. That's not what I've got.

BATEMAN 
What?

KIMBALL 
That's not the information I've received.

BATEMAN 
Well...I...Wait...What information have 
you received?

KIMBALL 
Let's see...
(He flips through his notebook) 
That you were with-

BATEMAN 
Well, I could he wrong.

KIMBALL 
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?

BATEMAN 
(Clearly nervous and under pressure) 
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It 
was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner 
at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I 
physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't 
remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.

Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens 
his briefcase to put away his notebook.

KIMBALL 
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

BATEMAN 
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long 
day-a bit scattered.

KIMBALL 
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch 
in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?

BATEMAN 
Great, yes, I'd like that.

KIMBALL 
And if you could try and pin down where you were 
the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a 
lot easier.

BATEMAN 
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a 
new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up.

KIMBALL 
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I 
just bought it on my way here.

Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified.

BATEMAN 
Never. I mean...I don't really like...
singers.

KIMBALL 
Not a big music fan, eh?

BATEMAN 
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too...
black sounding. For me.

KIMBALL 
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll 
call your secretary about reservations.

BATEMAN 
I'll be there.

EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. 
The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a 
half-opened window.

CHRISTIE 
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after 
last time...

BATEMAN 
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.

CHRISTIE 
I don't think so.

He hands her a $500 bill.

BATEMAN 
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 

The driver's here, you'll be safe.

Christie gets in hesitantly.

BATEMAN 
Nothing like last time, promise.

CHRISTIE 
Alright.

He pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it.

BATEMAN 
(Chatting as if they were at a cocktail party) 
So, you're looking great, how have you been?

CHRISTIE 
(A little confused) 
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.

BATEMAN 
(Mock shock) 
Really?

CHRISTIE 
My friend told me I should maybe even get a 
lawyer.

BATEMAN 
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.

He writes her a check for $I ,000 to cash and hands it to 
her. She snatches the check out of his hand and gets 
quickly out of the limo, walking hurriedly down the street.

BATEMAN 
Bitch.

He follows alongside her slowly in the limo, waving a huge 
wad of cash at her. She hesitates; he uses the money to 
lure her into the car. As she reluctantly gets into the 
limo, she reaches for the money.

He snatches it away.

BATEMAN 
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.

She takes the money and puts it inside her shirt.

BATEMAN 
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, 
Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. 
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything 
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?

Christie nods.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The living room: ELIZABETH has kicked off her shoes and flopped 
down on the couch underneath the Baselitz. Elizabeth is an 
attractive, dark-haired society girl who models occasionally. 
Christie is sitting on the couch opposite her, pretending to 
examine a CD.

ELIZABETH 
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?

Christie shakes her head.

The kitchen: Bateman is grinding up tabs of Ecstasy and 
putting them in a bottle of wine. In the living room, Elizabeth 
is still staring at Christie as if she came from Mars.

ELIZABETH 
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?

Christie looks blank.

ELIZABETH 
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.

Christie still blank.

ELIZABETH 
You know, Au Bar?

Christie shakes her head.

ELIZABETH 
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth
day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.

Bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses.
Christie, who seems frightened, sips her wine and stares at 
the floor. There is an awkward silence.

CHRISTIE 
This is nicer than your other apartment.

BATEMAN 
(Offended that she prefers Owen's apartment) 
It's not that nice.

Silence.

CHRISTIE 
Where did you two meet?

ELIZABETH 
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, 
'87, and...
(Turning to Patrick) 
You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole. 
(Sarcastically) 
Hot number.

BATEMAN 
What do you mean, she was a hot number.

ELIZABETH 
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. 
(To Christie) 
Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need
I say more?...What do you do?

A long silence. Christie reddens and stares at the floor. 

BATEMAN 
She's my...cousin. 

ELIZABETH 
(Skeptically) 
Uh huh? 

BATEMAN
She's from...France.

A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously. 

ELIZABETH 
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.

Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares 
At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. 

ELIZABETH 
Where do you summer? Southampton?

Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth.

CHRISTIE 
No.

ELIZABETH 
(Listening to the receiver) 
Oh God, it's his machine.

BATEMAN 
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.

ELIZABETH 
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.

BATEMAN 
Don't tell him you're here.

ELIZABETH 
Why would I?

Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the
whole glass, making a face.

ELIZABETH 
This tastes weird. 
(She examines the label and shrugs)
Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway 
you'd like. I'm at-

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
You're at Paul Owen s.

ELIZABETH 
Who?

BATEMAN 
(Whispering) 
Paul Owen.

ELIZABETH 
I want the number, idiot. 
(She waves him away and continues into the reciever) 
Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I 
don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my 
hairdresser on you.

She hangs up.

ELIZABETH 
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce 
& Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?

BATEMAN 
No.

ELIZABETH 
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.

Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her 
another glass of the drugged wine.

BATEMAN 
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. 
What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.

ELIZABETH 
(Laughing) 
Patrick, you re a lunatic.

BATEMAN 
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?

ELIZABETH 
Let's not get lewd. 
(Flirty) 
I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.

BATEMAN 
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.

ELIZABETH 
(To Christie) 
Does he do this all the time?

Christie shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip.

BATEMAN 
(To Elizabeth) 
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?

ELIZABETH 
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?

BATEMAN 
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.

ELIZABETH 
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me 
feel weird.

LATER:

Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making 
out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, 
showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover.

BATEMAN 
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP 
called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles 
on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps 
across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's 
mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album 
on a first listening.

ELIZABETH 
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You 
actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?

She giggles, rolling off the sofa onto the floor.

BATEMAN 
(Ignoring her) 
It's hard to choose a favorite track 
among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" 
is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about 
self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message 
crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope 
that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. 
Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in 
to empathize with others, we can always empathize with 
ourselves.

As he speaks, he opens the case and carefully places the CD 
in the player, admiring its pristine silver surface, and 
watches it slide into the machine.

BATEMAN 
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's 
beautifully stated on the album.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

AN OUT-OF-FOCUS HOME VIDEO SHOT of Elizabeth, Christie and 
Bateman in the throes of sex, in the master bedroom.

CUT BACK TO WIDE SHOT of the bedroom, partially blocked by 
the video camera in the foreground. Their bodies are an 
incoherent tangle of arms and legs. The only sounds are 
moans, heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against 
flesh. CLOSE ON Christie's head and shoulders. Her eyes are 
shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional 
performance, turning her head every so often to check the 
progress of her partners.

OFFSCREEN WE HEAR Elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure, 
moaning loudly. Her voice gets louder and louder and then 
shifts to actual pain.

Bateman rises up off the bed, suddenly appearing behind 
Christie. There is blood on his face.

Christie turns her head and sees him. She screams and leaps 
off the bed, running out of the room. She slams the 
mirrored door behind her, and as it swings shut for a split 
second we see Elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed.

We follow Christie out of the room, panicking, screaming.

Christie runs down a darkened hallway, frantically opening 
doors, looking for an escape.

She hears the SOUND OF A CHAINSAW coming from the bedroom.

She opens a closet. The closet lights up as she opens the 
door and sees two dead, women hanging inside. She screams, 
then claps a hand over her mouth. She stops and listens. THE 
DISTANT SOUND OF THE CHAINSAW.

She backs away slowly, into another dark room, lit only by 
the light from a television set. Through the darkness she 
sees a head on the top of the TV and starts to whimper.

She runs toward the nearest door. Finding herself in the 
main hallway, she begins to jog toward the front door, then 
runs.

Bateman appears from nowhere, holding the chainsaw, 
spattered with blood.

Christie screams and changes direction. Bateman leaps at 
her, bellowing.

They run through the bedroom and into the bathroom. 
Christie trips over Elizabeth's body, which is half in the 
bathtub.

Both are slipping on the floor, which is slick with blood.

Christie falls, tries to get up. Bateman grabs her leg. He 
tries to bite it.

She kicks him in the face and gets up, running toward the 
front door.

He runs after her.

BATEMAN 
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you 
piece of bitch trash!

Christie, screaming, makes it out the front door.

Bateman runs after her.

She runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors.

She moves to the elevator, pounding hysterically on the 
buttons. She sees the stairwell and runs for it.

Bateman sees this and runs after her, revving the chainsaw.

She runs down the stairs, Bateman two flights behind her. 
He stops, leans over the railing to look at her, then aims 
the chainsaw at her and drops it.

Christie SCREAMS OFFSCREEN, then is suddenly silent.

FROM BATEMAN'S POV we see Christie's body sprawled facedown 
at the bottom of the stairwell. The chainsaw sticks out of 
her back like a sword.

INT. CRAYONS - EARLY EVENING 

An insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif: paper 
tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing, lots of primary 
colors, and a goldfish bowl on each table.

Bateman is at a table with Evelyn. They are both drawing on 
the tablecloth. Bateman is drawing Christie with the 
chainsaw in her back.

EVELYN 
I want a firm commitment.

BATEMAN 
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.

Evelyn waves to a couple across the room.

EVELYN 
(Distracted) 
Why? What's wrong?

BATEMAN 
(Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) 
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale 
cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill 
my needs.

The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a
new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly.

BATEMAN 
We need to talk.

EVELYN 
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk 
about?

BATEMAN 
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over

EVELYN 
(Motioning to the waiter for water) 
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just 
avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?

BATEMAN 
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This 
is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

EVELYN 
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your 
friends. I don't think it would work. 
(Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) 
You have a little something on your upper lip.

BATEMAN 
(Brushing her hand away) 
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about 
that. You can have them.

Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a 
realization dawning.

EVELYN 
You're really serious, aren't you?

BATEMAN 
Yes, I am.

EVELYN 
But what about the past? Our past?

BATEMAN 
We never really shared one.

EVELYN 
You're inhuman.

BATEMAN 
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. 
(He pauses, as if searching for the right words) 
You're just not terribly important to me.

Evelyn begins to cry.

EVELYN 
No, no, no.

BATEMAN 
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

She reaches desperately across the table and takes his 
hand. Bateman pulls his hand away.

EVELYN 
(Sobbing) 
What do you want me to do, what is it you want?

The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is
becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed.

BATEMAN 
(Looking uncomfortably around the room) 
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making 
this scene right now.

EVELYN 
Oh God, I can't believe this.

BATEMAN 
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.

Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the 
tears so they will not affect her make-up.

EVELYN 
(Surprisingly calm) 
Where are you going?

BATEMAN 
I'm just leaving.

EVELYN 
But where?

BATEMAN 
I have to return some videotapes.

He rushes out of the room.

EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING 

Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat.

BATEMAN 
Here kitty, kitty.

The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and 
walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in 
the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT.
Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the 
deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He 
takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the 
kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him.

WOMAN 
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?

Bateman wheels around and shoots her. She falls screaming 
to the floor.

Responding to the gunshot, A POLICE CAR SIREN WAILS in the 
distance. Bateman breaks into a run. The police car 
screeches after him.

COP CAR (O.S.)
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.

Bateman ducks down an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 

A COP rushes toward him, seemingly from 
out of nowhere, and tackles him, trying to get the gun away 
from him.

Bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of 
them have their hands on the gun, then shoots him again. He 
reloads the gun. The sound of more COP CARS arriving.

He runs out of the alley.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As he reaches the street, he finds A PHALANX OF POLICE CARS
approaching.

COP CAR 
Halt. Put down your weapon.

The cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air. 
Bateman shoots at them. The police return fire.

Bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues
shooting wildly. A bullet hits the gas tank of one of the 
police cars. It catches fire and explodes. The flames light 
up the scene, illuminating the bodies of policemen both living 
and dead.

NEW ANGLE: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera follows 
him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each 
one, setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS.
THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws near.

NEW ANGLE: He runs, panting, until he ends up in front of a 
tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches, 
the lights in the building are going off floor by floor.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT 

He rushes into the lobby, running for the elevator.

NIGHT WATCHMAN 
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You 
forgot to sign in.

Bateman wheels around and shoots him. He runs toward the 
revolving doors. As he swings around in the doors, he 
notices a JANITOR who has witnessed the shooting. He 
revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor.

NEW ANGLE: 

He runs out of the building and across the 
street to an identical office building, the one that houses 
Pierce & Pierce.

INT. PIERCE & PIERCE LOBBY - NIGHT 

Bateman nods at the Pierce & Pierce NIGHT WATCHMAN and signs 
in. He breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close 
behind him.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 

Bateman stands looking out 
through the floor-length windows at a panoramic night view 
of the city and the river.

Below him he sees a SWAT TEAM swarming over the roof of the 
opposite building. There are ambulances standing by, flares 
everywhere, distant sirens.

Suddenly, THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER draws near. Frightened, 
he drops to the floor behind his desk.

Helicopter searchlights scan the building, illuminating 
Bateman's office for a few moments with a blaze of light.

He is crouched in one corner, half-sobbing, talking into 
the phone, as the searchlight keeps circling.

BATEMAN 
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my 
lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of 
people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some 
homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in 
Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' 
Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail 
gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I 
killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost 
got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I 
can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed 
Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving 
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything 
out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes 
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even...
well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. 
Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not 
sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess 
I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show 
up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.

Bateman hangs up the phone. The helicopter searchlight 
circles back, briefly illuminating the room. The camera rises 
up over Bateman huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the 
sky.

INT. SMITH AND WOLLENSKY RESTAURANT - DAY 

KIMBALL and Bateman are sitting at a corner table.

KIMBALL 
(Very surprised) 
No hash browns? 

BATEMAN 
Not in the mood, I guess.

KIMBALL 
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I 
mean- it's-have you been here before?

BATEMAN 
(Deliberately nonchalant) 
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not...
ordering them.

KIMBALL 
(Looking at him like he's nuts) 
Suit yourself, I guess.

Pause.

KIMBALL 
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on 
what you did?

BATEMAN 
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some 
sorbet?

KIMBALL 
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.

BATEMAN 
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?

KIMBALL 
According to his date book, and this was verified by his 
secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.

BATEMAN 
And?

KIMBALL 
I've questioned him.

BATEMAN 
Marcus?

KIMBALL 
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't 
be sure.

BATEMAN 
But Marcus denied it?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

BATEMAN 
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

KIMBALL 
Yes.

A pause.

BATEMAN 
He does? You're sure?

KIMBALL 
(smiling)
I checked it out. It's clean.

BATEMAN 
Oh.
KIMBALL Now where were you? 
(He laughs) 

BATEMAN 
(Laughing with him) 
Where was Marcus? 

KIMBALL 
He wasn't with Paul 
Owen. 

BATEMAN 
So who was he with? 

KIMBALL 
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, 
Harry Newman, George Butner and  
(He pauses, Then looks up) 
- you.

A moment of stunned silence.

BATEMAN 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen 
to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner 
with Victoria...the following night. 

KIMBALL 
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for 
a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. 
Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or 
later. 
(A pause) 
I mean, to think that one of his friends 
killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too 
ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? 

McDermott stops by the table. 

McDERMOTT 
KIMBALL! How's the investigation? 
Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. 
(Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) 
Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? 

Bateman looks at him in silence, 
panicking. 

McDERMOTT 
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky 
without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a 
raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. 
(He wanders off muttering) 
No fucking hash browns...

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He 
has a surgical mask in one hand.

DOORMAN 
What can I do for you, sir?

BATEMAN 
20B.

DOORMAN 
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.

BATEMAN 
Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN 
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly 
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English 
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There 
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands 
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman 
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops 
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He 
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. 
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE 
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN 
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the 
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE 
Can I help you?

BATEMAN
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

BATEMAN 
Doesn't he live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
No, he doesn't.

BATEMAN 
Are you sure?

MRS. WOLFE 
You saw the ad in the Times?

BATEMAN 
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But...
doesn't Paul Owen still live here?

MRS. WOLFE 
There was no ad in the Times.

Bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other.

MRS. WOLFE 
I think you should go now.

BATEMAN 
But I think...I want to know what happened 
here.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.

Bateman backs away slowly.

MRS. WOLFE 
Don't come back.

BATEMAN 
I won't...don't worry.

Mrs. Wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall, 
rattled, and gets into the elevator.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 

Bateman enters the revolving 
door of an office building, panicking and breathing 
heavily. He is sweating, his hair is wild, and he looks 
deranged. He goes around the revolving door twice and comes 
out onto the street again, where he bumps smack into a GUY 
just like him.

GUY 
Hey, Kinsley.

Bateman looks up at him wild-eyed.

GUY 
See you at Fluties, okay?

The guy walks away, utterly unfazed. Bateman wanders down 
the street, banging his briefcase against walls, garbage 
cans, etc.

EXT. MIDTOWN PHONE BOOTH - DAY 

Bateman searches his pockets 
for pills. He finds three different pills and swallows 
them. He's sweating, and takes his jacket off to wipe his 
face, dialing a number.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick Bateman's office.

BATEMAN 
Jean? Hello? Jean?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? Is that you?

BATEMAN 
Hello? Jean, I need help!

JEAN (O.S.)
Where are you?

BATEMAN 
Jean-I'm not-

JEAN (O.S.) 
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and 
David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.

BATEMAN 
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Patrick? I can't hear you.

BATEMAN 
What are I doing?

JEAN (O.S.) 
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?

BATEMAN 
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.

Pause.

BATEMAN 
...to the office this afternoon.

JEAN (O.S.) 
Why?

BATEMAN 
(Screaming) 
Just...say...no!

JEAN (O.S.) 
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?

BATEMAN 
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!

He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck 
into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his 
jacket.

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY 

Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens 
his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING 

Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the 
previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking 
and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, 
still breathing heavily.

Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations.

McDERMOTT 
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough 
day at the office?

They all laugh.

McDERMOTT 
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking 
Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't 
get a reservation to save his life.

Bateman sits down silently.

McDERMOTT 
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.

BATEMAN 
(On automatic) 
I'm not going anywhere unless we 
have a reservation.

VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, 
faggots-just get a res.

PRICE 
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.

Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. 

BATEMAN 
(He downs his drink) 
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.
He approaches Carnes cautiously. 

CARNES 
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the 
end of the '90s.

Bateman approaches, trying to act casual.

BATEMAN 
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.

Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused.

BATEMAN 
So, Harold, did you get my message?

Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs.

CARNES 
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, 
wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
(Waving smoke out of his face) 
Yes, naturally.

CARNES 
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s 
fabulous. That's rich...

Pause

CARNES 
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?

BATEMAN 
What exactly do you mean?

CARNES 
The message you left.

Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

CARNES 
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still 
seeing her, right?

BATEMAN 
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?

Carnes isn't really listening.

CARNES 
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?

He turns to go.

BATEMAN 
Carnes? Wait.

CARNES 
(Sighing) 
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. 
But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, 
such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully 
appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said 
Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's 
have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

BATEMAN 
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?

CARNES 
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let 
alone...what was it you said he did to her?

Carnes looks around the club, raises his glass to a passing 
couple. He laughs politely.

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...

BATEMAN 
(Desperate, shouting) 
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really 
comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. 
I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. 
I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your 
machine was true.

CARNES 
Excuse me. I really must he going.

BATEMAN 
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm 
Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! 
Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.

Carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance.

BATEMAN 
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed 
Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer

CARNES 
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find 
this funny anymore.

BATEMAN 
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?

CARNES 
(Eyeing Bateman worriedly)
It's just not.

BATEMAN 
Why not, you stupid bastard?

Carnes stares at him.

CARNES 
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in 
London...just ten days ago.

BATEMAN 
No, you...didn't?

CARNES 
Now, if you'll excuse me.

Bateman returns back to his friends' table, in a daze.
They are all looking at the television, where Ronald 
Reagan is giving a speech about Iran Contra. They are 
halfheartedly arguing about whether or not he's 
lying.

PRICE 
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?

VAN PATTEN 
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? 
I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have 
reservations somewhere.

PRICE 
(To Bateman) 
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so...
out of it. So...undangerous.

McDERMOTT 
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless.
Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that 
shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, 
what can I say?

PRICE 
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that 
way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so 
fucking, I don't know, cool about it?

VAN PATTEN 
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

Bateman laughs at this. Price shoots him a look.

PRICE 
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?

BATEMAN 
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'.
VAN PATTEN 
(To Price) Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. 
Working for UNICEF now?

McDERMOTT 
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?

PRICE 
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless 
Old codger. But inside...

Pause.

PRICE 
But inside...

The SOUNDS OF THE BAR FADE AWAY and we hear Bateman's thoughts:

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
But inside doesn't matter...

THE SOUNDS OF THE BAR RETURN.

McDERMOTT 
(Bored)
Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually 
listening to you.

PRICE 
Bateman? Come on, what do you think? 

Bateman looks up and smiles at Price. Then shrugs.

BATEMAN 
Whatever.

The conversation breaks up as Van Patten takes out his phone. 

VAN PATTEN 
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.

The sounds of the bar fade down. The following voiceover runs 
over images of Bateman and his friends ordering drinks, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing - combined with images of 
other very similar young men at other tables drinking, talking 
on portable phones, talking, laughing,

BATEMAN (V.O.)
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with 
the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, 
all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward 
it, I have now surpassed...

INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Jean is alone in Bateman's office, looking through his diary. 
We see the pages that she is looking at. They are filled with 
doodles of mutilated women and their names...Jean looks lost 
and frightened, and begins to cry.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better 
world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on 
others. I want no escape.

INT. HARRY'S BAR - EARLY EVENING 
As the film ends the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is 
leaning back in his leather armchair, drinking a double Scotch, 
his eyes blank.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no 
deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted 
from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any 
of this. This confession has meant nothing...

The camera moves up to a sign on the wall behind him: 
"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT."

CREDITS ROLL
"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John Landis

 



     FADE IN

1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT

     on the moon.

     EXT. MOON

     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.

2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.


                                                  CUT TO:

     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.

     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER

     They've been cramped for hours.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
               Here, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.

                         JACK
               Yes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
                    (as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.

                         DAVID
               Thanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.

     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     As they walk, their breath visible:

                         JACK
               Are you cold?

                         DAVID
               Yes.

                         JACK
               Good.

     They walk on, finally:

                         DAVID
               Jack.

                         JACK
               David.

                         DAVID
               You're not having a good time
               are you?

                         JACK
               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.

                         DAVID
               Well, I like it here.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.

                         DAVID
               Right.

     They walk on.
                         JACK
               Do you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?

                         DAVID
               I think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.

                         JACK
               Debbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.

                         DAVID
               She's a jerk.

                         JACK
               You're talking about the woman
               I love.

                         DAVID
               I'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.

                         JACK
               Well, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.

                         JACK
                    (like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
               The love affair that shocked
               Europe!  See torrid lovemaking
               at its most explicit!  See
               Jack and Debbie expose their
               lust in the sacred halls of
               the Vatican!  Never has the
               screen dared....

                         DAVID
               If you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.

                         JACK
               I have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.

                         DAVID
               It just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.

                         JACK
               It is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.

                         DAVID
               We've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?

                         JACK
               She says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.


                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.

4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".

                         JACK
               The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's a wolf's head.

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.

                         DAVID
               A severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.

                         JACK
               David, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.

                         DAVID
               I assume full responsibility.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         DAVID
               Shall we?

5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Nice to see you.

     FACES

     Silent and staring.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID AND JACK

                         DAVID
                    (smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.

                         JACK
               Do you have any hot soup?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         DAVID
               Well, do you have any coffee?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Hot chocolate?
                         WOMAN
               We've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.

                         JACK
               Then you have some hot tea?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Oh.

                         WOMAN
               But I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.

                         DAVID & JACK
               Yes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.

                         JACK
               Nice looking group.

                         DAVID
               Listen, at least it's warm in
               here.

                         JACK
               Look at that.

                                                  CUT TO:

     JACK'S P.O.V.

     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.

                         DAVID
               What about it?

                         JACK
               It's a five-pointed star.

                         DAVID
               Maybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.

                         JACK
                    (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

                         WOMAN
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               He was joking.  Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               She means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.

                         DAVID
               Oh, yes, of course.

                         JACK
               Right, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Bloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?

                         WOMAN
               No, but we're about to.

     Laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               You be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.

                         WOMAN
                    (heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               All right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.

                         WOMAN
               Oh, come on, tell us.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Right.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.

                         WOMAN
               That's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Go on, ask them.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....

                         DART PLAYERS
               Hear!  Hear!

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...
                         DART PLAYER
               Remember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.

                         JACK
               Excuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               You've made me miss.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.

                         DART PLAYER
               I've never missed the board
               before.

                         DAVID
               Jack, we'd better go.

                         JACK
               What do you mean?  I'm
               starving.

                         DART PLAYER
               There's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.

                         DAVID
               Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

                         JACK
               Apparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.

                         WOMAN
                    (to men)
               You can't let them go.

                         DAVID
                    (worried)
               How much do we owe you?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.

                         DAVID
               Uh, thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Wait!  You just can't let them
               go!

                         DART PLAYER
               Go!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.

                         DAVID
               Yes, well, thanks again.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Beware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.

6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is very cold.

                         JACK
               What the hell was that all
               about?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon?

                         DAVID
               Come on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.

7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is quiet.

                         WOMAN
               You can't let them go.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!

                         CHESS PLAYER
               It's murder then.

                         DART PLAYER
               Then murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

     walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

                         DAVID
               That was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.

                         JACK
               I don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.

                         DAVID
               Well, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.

                         JACK
               What do you think was wrong?

                         DAVID
               I have no idea.

                         JACK
               Maybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.

                         DAVID
               I see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

                         DAVID
               Please don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.

                         DAVID
               Of course.

     They walk getting soaked.

                         JACK
               Say, David....

                         DAVID
               I'm well aware of how pleasant
               the weather is in Rome at the
               present time thank you.

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.

                         JACK
               Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.

                         WOMAN
               Perhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!

                         WOMAN
               You could have told them!

                         DART PLAYER
               Are you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.

                         WOMAN
               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear it?  We must go
               to them.

                         DART PLAYER
               I heard nothing.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.

                         JACK
               Did you hear that?

                         DAVID
               I heard that.

                         JACK
               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

                         DAVID
               Could be a lot of things.

                         JACK
               Yeah?

                         DAVID
               A coyote.

                         JACK
               There aren't any coyotes in
               England.

                         DAVID
               The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                         JACK
               Pecos Bill.

                         DAVID
               Heathcliffe.

                         JACK
               Heathcliffe didn't howl.

                         DAVID
               No, but he was on the moors.

                         JACK
               It's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

                         JACK
               I vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.

                         DAVID
               Yeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.

                         DAVID
               We're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.

                         JACK
               Shit!  David, what is that?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Come on.

                         JACK
               Come on, where?

                         DAVID
               Anywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.

                         DAVID
               It's moving.

                         JACK
               It's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.

                         JACK
               Fuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.

                         DAVID
               What's the plan?

                         JACK
                    (nervously)
               Plan?

                         DAVID
                    (not too relaxed
                     himself)
               Let's just keep walking.

     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

                         DAVID
               That's right, a lovely stroll
               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.

                         DAVID
               It's in front of us.

                         JACK
               Do you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

     BOYS' P.O.V.

     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.

                         JACK
               Oh shit.  What is that?

                         DAVID
               A sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

                         JACK
               Nice doggie.  Good boy.

                         DAVID
               Walk away, Jack.

                         JACK
               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.

                         DAVID
               See anything?

                         JACK
               No.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.

                         DAVID
               It sounds far away.

                         JACK
               Not far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.

                         DAVID
               Jack?

                         JACK
               Yeah.

                         DAVID
               Where are we going?

                         JACK
               I'll tell you when we get
               there.

                         DAVID
               Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.

                         JACK
               You really scared me, you
               shithead.

                         DAVID
               Are you going to help me up?

     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!

     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.

                         JACK
               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please
               help me!  Please!  David!
               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.

                         DAVID
               Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
     mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.

                         DAVID
               Jack....

     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs
     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
     hulking form rolls off of him.

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers
     crowd around, David falls back and faints.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls
     out....

                         DAVID
               Jack?!

     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a
     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS
     GALLAGHER, comes in.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He all right?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think.  He
               called out just now.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He's an American, you know.
               Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
               round one of those Embassy
               fellows to see him.

                         ALEX
               Chart says he's from New York.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I think he's a Jew.

                         ALEX
               Why on earth do you say that?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I looked.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Really, Susan, I don't think
               that was very proper, and
               besides, it's common practice
               now.

     A voice startles the girls.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
               Price is quite right.

     DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the
     customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring
     presence.  The girls are embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
               out a minute ago.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, surely you
               must perform some function
               here at the hospital.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Then get on with it.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

     She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex
     watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Can I be of service, Miss
               Price?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Go about your duties.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

     She starts to exit.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, Miss Price?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What exactly did he call out?

                         ALEX
               He said `Jack'.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               That would be Jack Goodman,
               the boy who was killed.

                         ALEX
               What happened to them?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The police report said an
               escaped lunatic attacked them.
               He must have been a very
               powerful man.  Although I
               really don't see that it is
               any of your concern, Miss
               Price.

                         ALEX
               No, sir.  Of course, sir.
               Good day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
     looking into David's eyes.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the
     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The
     camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
     the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and
     harder, then too loud when we:

                                                  CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing
     beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr.
     Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch
               and this is a countryman of
               yours, Mr. Collins.

                         DAVID
               Where am I?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're in a hospital in
               London.

                         DAVID
               London?  Where's Jack?  I had
               a strange dream.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I should think so after your
               recent traumatic experiences.

                         DAVID
               The guy I was with.  Is he all
               right?  How did I get to
               London?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (quietly)
               Now, David, I want you to
               prepare yourself; your friend
               is dead.
     David jolts up in bed and shouts.

                         DAVID
               What?

     The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

                         DAVID
               Ow, shit!

     He sinks back down.

                         DAVID
               Jack's dead?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins
               of the American Embassy here
               in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.
               Goodman's parents and your
               parents have been notified of
               your injuries and everything's
               in order.

                         DAVID
               Everything's in order?  What
               are you talking about?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Goodman's body has been
               air-freighted back to New York
               for burial and your parents
               have wired funds for your stay
               in the hospital until you are
               well enough to fly home.

                         DAVID
                    (controlled tears)
               You don't crate and ship Jack
               like some side of beef.
                    (approaching hysteria)
               Who the hell are you people?
               What's going on here?  Where
               is Jack?  I demand to see him!

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (holds David down,
                     calls out)
               Miss Price!  Miss Price,
               please!

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Get your fucking hands off me!
               What the hell is going on
               here?

     Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.

                         MR. COLLINS
                    (distraught, clutching
                     his briefcase)
               I realize how upsetting this
               must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
               but please try to refrain from
               hysterics.

     David continues shouting and struggling.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Prepare a hypodermic, please,
               Miss Price.

     The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
     Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
     normal.

                         MR. COLLINS
               Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
               excite yourself.  Everything
               has been arranged.  I shall
               come back to check on your
               progress and send a report to
               your parents.  The police have
               requested to interview you and
               I have given them permission
               to do so.

     Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Thank you very much, Mr.
               Collins.  He'll rest now and
               I'm sure everything will be
               fine once he's adjusted.  He's
               had quite a shock.

                         MR. COLLINS
               These dumb-ass kids never
               appreciate anything you do for
               them.

     Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

                         DAVID
               How long have I been here?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've been unconscious since
               you were brought in two weeks
               ago.

                         DAVID
               Two weeks?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've suffered some rather
               severe cuts and bruises, lost
               a bit of blood, but nothing
               too serious; black and blue
               for a while.  You'll have some
               dueling scars to boast of.
               That lunatic must have been a
               very fierce fellow.  They say
               a mad man has the strength of
               ten.

                         DAVID
                    (softly, as the drugs
                     take hold)
               Lunatic?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now we've just given you a
               pretty strong sedative, so try
               to get some rest now.  Miss
               Price will see to your needs.
               Rest now.

     Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.

                         DAVID
                    (softly)
               It wasn't a lunatic.

                         ALEX
                    (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               It was a wolf.

                         ALEX
                    (bends down close
                     to hear)
               What?

                         DAVID
               A wolf.

     David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did he say a wolf?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
     calendar.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               But Roger is so terribly
               boring.  Yes, dear, but
               couldn't we...I see.
                    (he makes a note)
               Thursday at eight, dinner with
               boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I
               will; if I survived Rommel, I
               suppose I'll survive another
               excruciating evening with
               Roger Mathison.  Be a good
               girl.  Bye.

     He hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
               are here to see you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Send them in.

     He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
     the other rather pudgy.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come in, come in.  Please sit.
               Some tea?

     The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a
     small notebook.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               I'd like some tea, please.

     Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe
               later.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's no problem.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Well, then, what can I do for
               Scotland Yard?

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We understand the Kessler boy
               has regained consciousness.

     Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Sorry.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has Mr. Kessler said anything
               regarding the attack on the
               moors?

     The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Excuse me.  Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Roger Mathison, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What here?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               He's on the telephone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Tell him I'm out.  No, tell
               him I've passed away.  An old
               war wound or something.  Tell
               him I'm dead.  And no more
               calls!

     He turns from the intercom back to the cops.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You were saying?

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has David Kessler anything to
               say concerning the attack on
               the moors?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Why don't we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
     stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry if I conflict with
               your report, but Jack and I
               were not attacked by a man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               So you've said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point,
               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys
               would be able to defend
               themselves against one man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Sgt. McManus, are you
               suggesting that David and Jack
               were, in fact, attacked by
               some animal and that the
               officialdom of East Proctor
               has conspired to keep it a
               secret?  We have an autopsy
               report on the murderer who was
               shot in the act by the local
               police.  We have two witnesses
               to the crime.  You'll forgive
               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
               your testimony as coming from
               someone who has gone through a
               terrible shock.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Lieutenant, the boy seems
               pretty lucid to me and....

                         LT. VILLIERS
               And what, Sergeant?

                         SGT. McMANUS
                    (defeated)
               I don't rightly know, sir.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               That is precisely my point.
               David, as far as we are
               concerned, the matter is
               closed.  We won't trouble you
               any further.  Good day.

     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles
     at David and follows.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Doctor.

     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.

                         DAVID
               There were witnesses?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               So they said.

                         DAVID
               How could there have been
               witnesses?  It was so dark.
               We were running and I fell and
               Jack went to help me up and
               this thing came from
               nowhere...I don't understand
               what they're talking about.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               In time I'm sure it will all
               come back to you.

                         DAVID
               Doctor, my memory is fine.
               It's my sanity I'm beginning
               to worry about.

                                                  CUT TO:

16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs
     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,
     looking about.

     CLOSEUP

     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

     DAVID

     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with
     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We
     see him completely as the animal, study his movement
     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops
     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly
     he pushes some leaves aside.

     CLOSEUP

     of his eyes.

     DAVID'S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The
     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders
     tensing.

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

     CLOSEUP

     of the frightened deer.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     THE FAWN

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame
     as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame,
     his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered
     with blood.  He howls in triumph.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door
     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss
     Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to
     David, turns on the bed light and touches him.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.

                         DAVID
                    (awakened)
               I was having a nightmare.

     Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the
     pills and pouring a glass of water.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, well these should help
               that.  That's right, drink up.

     David takes the pills.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Now go back to sleep so you'll
               be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
               morning.

                         DAVID
               What time is it?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               It's nearly eight.  I'm off
               duty shortly, then I'm off to
               the films with Alex.

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Miss Price, the other nurse
               that attended you.

                         DAVID
               What are you going to see?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               An American film about the
               Mafia called `See You Next
               Wednesday', and I want to see
               it badly, so you give me no
               problems and go to sleep.

                         DAVID
                    (dropping off)
               Do you have bad dreams, too?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Some, everyone does.

                         DAVID
               Yes, but does everyone kill
               Bambi?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Bambi?

     David has fallen asleep.  Miss Gallagher turns off the
     light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Kill Bambi?

     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into
     darkness.

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY

     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys
     about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing
     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'
     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Take these round now, will you
               please?  The American boy in
               twenty-one is only to have
               these after he's eaten.  Will
               you be sure of that?

                         ALEX
               Has he been refusing food?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Nothing quite as dramatic as
               that, Miss Price.  He just
               doesn't eat enough of what is
               put before him.  He suffers
               from nightmares.  I'd think he
               just needs a hand to hold.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
     appearance.  She enters.

19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY

     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

                         ALEX
               Hello, Benjamin.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Well, all right then, be that
               way.  Here, swallow this.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.
     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
     handing Alex back the glass.

                         ALEX
               Feeling better?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               The doctor will be round
               later.  Would you like a
               picture book to look at?  We
               have some lovely funny Beanos.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
     Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
     Benjamin's ward.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

                         ALEX
               Has the patient in twenty-one
               gotten his tray yet?

                         ORDERLY
               The American?  Yes, duck.

                         ALEX
               How did he look?

                         ORDERLY
               What do you mean, `how did he
               look'?

                         ALEX
               You know, did he seem
               depressed?  Do you think he'll
               eat the food?

                         ORDERLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm an orderly, not a bleeding
               psychiatrist!  I push things
               about, but I've little say
               what happens to them.

                         ALEX
               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
     She hesitates, then peeks in.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
     patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is
     apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               Mr. Kessler?

                         DAVID
                    (lifeless)
               Yes?

                         ALEX
               You haven't eaten your lunch.

                         DAVID
               I'm not very hungry, thank
               you.

                         ALEX
               I'm afraid you have to eat
               something.

                         DAVID
               Please, really.  I'm not
               hungry.

                         ALEX
               You put me in an awkward
               position, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
               How is that?

                         ALEX
                    (she shakes the paper cup)
               Well, you're to take these
               after you've eaten.  Now what
               kind of nurse would I be if I
               failed in so simple a task as
               giving out some pills?

                         DAVID
               Leave the pills.  I'll take
               them later.

                         ALEX
               Sorry.

     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Miss Price!

                         ALEX
               Call me Alex.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Alex!

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               Mr. Kessler?

     David is getting interested.

                         DAVID
               Call me David.

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               David?

                         DAVID
               This is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

                         ALEX
               Let's try a little harder,
               shall we?

                         DAVID
               Will you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.

                         ALEX
               Will I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:

                         DAVID
               May I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.

FADE OUT

     FADE IN

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:

                         JACK (O.S.)
               David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
     the....

                                                  CUT TO:

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
     out....

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly, go at once to twenty-
               one and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Gallagher, remain here at
               the desk.  I'll be in twenty-
               one.

     She exits.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
     thoughtfully out the window.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've never had bad dreams
               before?

                         DAVID
                    (upset)
               Sure, as a kid.  But never so
               real.  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did you get a good look at the
               man who attacked you?

                         DAVID
               I've told you, it wasn't a
               man.  It was an animal.  A big
               wolf or something.  A rabid
               dog.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (chewing on his glasses)
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
               been traumatized, but Jack was
               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man
               can't do that to someone with
               his bare hands.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You'd be surprised what
               horrors a man is capable of.

                         DAVID
               Did you see Jack?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               No.  In fact, your wounds were
               cleaned and dressed before you
               arrived here.

                         DAVID
               Did you talk to the police in
               East Proctor?  Did the cops go
               to The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I really don't know.

                         DAVID
               Then why the hell are you so
               quick to disbelieve me?  You
               yourself said it must have
               taken incredible strength to
               tear apart a person like that.
                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (rubs his forehead)
               David, please.  The police are
               satisfied.  I'm certain that
               if a monster were out roaming
               northern England we'd have
               seen it on the telly.

                         DAVID
               You really think I'm crazy,
               don't you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Believe me.  The Hound of the
               Baskervilles was an invention
               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
               And if you'd read the bloody
               book, you'd find that Holmes
               discovered your house of hell
               a fraud, a fake.

     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now really, David.  You're far
               too intelligent to go on this
               way.  When you return to
               America I want you to seek out
               a competent psychiatrist or
               psychologist or something and
               stop this nonsense.  You'll be
               leaving this hospital in three
               or four days, please remain
               sane.  At least until you are
               no longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

                         DAVID
               Dr. Hirsch?
                    (pause)
               I'd rather not be by myself.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Of course not, David.  I'll
               fetch in young Miss Price.

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and
     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex
     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
     feet, fingers and toes stretch.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               You're a very beautiful girl.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               I thought you were asleep.

                         DAVID
               I was.  What are you reading?

                         ALEX
               `A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

                         DAVID
               Do you like it?

                         ALEX
               I've just started it.  My
               friend gave it to me.

     They look at each other.

                         ALEX
               What do you dream about?

                         DAVID
               I dream of death mostly.

                         ALEX
               I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have
               asked you.

                         DAVID
               It's okay.  I want to talk to
               you.

     They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               That's not really a very
               proper question.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               Twenty-eight.

                         DAVID
               I'm twenty-seven.

                         ALEX
               I know.

                         DAVID
               Now what do you want to talk
               about?

                         ALEX
               Was Jack Goodman your good
               friend?

                         DAVID
                    (seriously)
               My best friend.  My very best
               friend.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               Shall I read to you?

                         DAVID
               What?  Oh, yes, please.

                         ALEX

               A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
               Clemens.  This is after the
               preface but before chapter
               one: A Word of Explanation.
               You all right?

                         DAVID
                    (settles back)
               Yes, go on.

                    (clears her throat)
               Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
               It was in Warwick Castle that
               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....

26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.

                         FATHER
               I'll get it.

     The pounding continues.

                         FATHER
               All right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.

                         DAVID
               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.

27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to
     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
     anyway.

                         ALEX
                    (yawns, smiles)
               Hello.  You all right?

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry I woke you up.

                         ALEX
               Don't be silly.  Can I get you
               something?

                         DAVID
               No, thank you.  Just keep me
               company for a while.

                         ALEX
               That's easy enough.

                         DAVID
               I keep having these really
               terrible dreams.  They are
               getting worse and I can't seem
               to stop them.

                         ALEX
               David, your dreams will stop.
               You'll leave England and your
               bad memories; and then this
               will all fade away.

                         DAVID
               Will you come with me?

                         ALEX
                    (taken aback)
               What?

                         DAVID
                    (smiling)
               I'm serious.  You don't know
               me and I know nothing about
               you.  We have a perfect
               relationship.

                         ALEX
               Now, David, I said I would
               keep you company, but I meant
               right here and now.

                         DAVID
               Will you think about it?

                         ALEX
               How did we get from your bad
               dreams to my taking a holiday
               with a patient?

                         DAVID
                    (big grin)
               Not just a patient -- me.

                         ALEX
               You're being awfully forward,
               aren't you?

                         DAVID
               Forgive me, I'm trying to
               cheer myself up and an affair
               with a beautiful nurse seemed
               like just the thing to do it.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               All I am to you is a sex
               fantasy then?

                         DAVID
               Now I'm embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Good.  I thought for a moment
               I was the only embarrassed one
               in the room.

     There is an awkward pause.

                         DAVID
               Where were we in the book?

     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

                         ALEX
                    (looking through
                     the book)
               Let me see here.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

                         ORDERLY
               Ah you're up.  Good morning
               and a good day to you.  We've
               quite a meal for you here this
               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,
               orange juice, and toast with
               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now
               eat it up and I'll be back for
               the dishes when you've
               finished.

     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been
     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
     notices his exit.

                         DAVID
               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a
     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

                         DAVID
                    (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.

                         JACK
                    (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.

                         DAVID
                    (unbelieving)
               Get the fuck out of here,
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Thanks a lot.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               This is too much.  I can't
               handle this.

                         JACK
               I'm aware that I don't look so
               great, but I thought you'd be
               glad to see me.

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat
     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at
     Jack horrified.

                         JACK
               David!  You're hurting my
               feelings.

                         DAVID
                    (astounded)
               Hurting your feelings?  Has it
               occurred to you that it may be
               unsettling to have you rise
               from your grave to visit me?
               Listen to me, I'm talking to a
               hamburger!

                         JACK
               I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
               David, but I had to come.

                         DAVID
                    (aghast)
               Aren't you supposed to be
               buried in New York someplace?

                         JACK
               Yeah.  Your parents came to my
               funeral.  I was surprised at
               how many people came.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Why should you be surprised?
               You were a very well-liked
               person.

                         JACK
               Debbie Klein cried a lot.

                         DAVID
               I can't stand it.

                         JACK
               So you know what she does?
               She's so grief stricken she
               runs to find solace in Rudy
               Levine's bed.

                         DAVID
               Rudy Levine the shmuck?

                         JACK
               Life mocks me even in death.

     Jack takes another bite of toast.

                         DAVID
                    (to himself)
               I'm going completely crazy.

                         JACK
                    (loud)
               David!

                         DAVID
                    (louder)
               What?!

                         JACK
               David, now I know this may be
               hard for you, but I have to
               warn you.

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Warn me?  Will you get out of
               here, you meat loaf?

                         JACK
               I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
               but I love you and that's why
               I'm here.  You've got to know.

                         DAVID
               If you love me so much, Jack,
               you'll realize how
               disconcerting it is to share
               one's breakfast with the
               living dead!

                         JACK
               We were attacked by a
               werewolf.

                         DAVID
                    (covers his ears)
               I'm not listening!

                         JACK
               On the moors, we were attacked
               by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

                         DAVID
               Shut up, you zombie!

                         JACK
               I was murdered, an unnatural
               death, and now I walk the
               earth in limbo until the
               werewolf's curse is lifted.

                         DAVID
                    (incredulous, furious)
               What's wrong with you?  Shut
               up!

                         JACK
               The wolf's bloodline must be
               severed.  The last remaining
               werewolf must be destroyed.

                         DAVID
               Will you be quiet?!

     Jack rises and comes closer to David.

                         JACK
               It's you, David.

                         DAVID
               What?!

                         JACK
               You survived and now you shall
               continue the curse.

                         DAVID
               What are you talking about?  I
               won't accept this!  Get out!
               God damit!

                         JACK
               Remember what that guy at The
               Slaughtered Lamb said?
               `Beware the moon.'

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Stop it, Jack.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon.  The full
               moon, David.  You've got two
               days.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Jack, please go away.  Please
               go away.

                         JACK
               You'll stalk the streets of
               London a creature of the
               night.

                         DAVID
                    (flares up)
               You're talking like Boris
               Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!

                         JACK
               David, please believe me.  You
               will kill people, David.
               You've got to stop the
               bloodshed before it begins.

                         DAVID
                    (yells)
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               Listen to me!  Take your own
               life, David.  It's our only
               chance.

                         DAVID
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               The supernatural!  The powers
               of darkness!  It's all true.
               Take your own life!  Suicide,
               David.  Join me.

                         DAVID
                    (losing it)
               Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!

                         JACK
               It's cold, David, and I'm so
               alone.  The undead surround
               me.  Have you ever talked to a
               corpse?  It's boring!  I'm
               lonely!  Kill yourself, David,
               before you kill others.

               Don't cry, David.

               Beware the moon, David.

     as she bursts into the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
     He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
     on the bed and hugs David.

                         ALEX
               David?  David!

     David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
     until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
     easier.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?

     David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               I'm a werewolf.

                         ALEX
               A werewolf?

     Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
     and backs off a little.  David composes himself.

                         ALEX
               Are you better now?

                         DAVID
               I'll let you know the next
               full moon.

                         ALEX
               You're to be discharged
               tomorrow.  Will you be all
               right?

     David takes Alex's hand.

                         DAVID
               My friend Jack was just here.

                         ALEX
               Your dead friend Jack?

                         DAVID
               Yeah.  He says that I will
               become a monster in two days.
               What do you think?

                         ALEX
               What do I think?  You mean
               about the possibility of your
               becoming a monster in two days
               or about visits from dead
               friends?

                         DAVID
               I was dreaming again?

                         ALEX
               I would think so.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Yeah, I would think so, too.

     Alex considers for a while, finally....

                         ALEX
               Do you have a place to stay in
               London?

                    (makes a face)
               David, perhaps you'd like to
               watch the telly while I take a
               shower.

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
     on his heels.

37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
     of water in the shower.

                         DAVID
               It's nice to see you.

                         ALEX
               It's nice to see you.

     MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY

     A sequence of soap and flesh.  Van Morrison's
     "Moondance" plays.  A montage of soapy hands on
     slippery skin.  Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and
     shoulders.  David and Alex kiss again and again and....

38   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's
     bed.  David pulls out and they lay holding each other.
     After a moment....

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Yes?

                         DAVID
               Will you be here in about
               fifteen minutes?

                         ALEX
               Of course.

                         DAVID
                    (leers)
               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

                         ALEX
               David, you don't honestly
               believe that in reality your
               friend Jack rose from the
               grave to breakfast with you?
               Do you really?

                         DAVID
               I was awake and he was in my
               room.

                         ALEX
               But, David.

                         DAVID
                    (firm)
               I wasn't hallucinating.

     Pause.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

                         DAVID
               That's good, Alex.  Reassure
               me.

     Alex begins kissing David's neck.

                         DAVID
               It's all right, I know I'm
               being insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

                         DAVID
               Okay, okay.  I'm properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
     lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to
     hold onto the headboard of the bed.

                         DAVID
                    (closing his eyes)
               This is very reassuring.  I'm
               feeling very reassured.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

     INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts
     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes
     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.

39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,
     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.

                         DAVID
                    (points a trembling
                     finger)
               You're not real.

                         JACK
               Don't be an asshole, David.
               Come here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
     room.

40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM

     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He
     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
     to wake up Alex.

                         DAVID
               What are you doing here?

                         JACK
               I wanted to see you.

                         DAVID
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now go
               away.

                         JACK
               David, I'm sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must
               understand what is going on.

                         DAVID
               I understand all right.
               You're one of the undead and
               I'm a werewolf.

                         JACK
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Get out of here, Jack!

                         JACK
               David, tomorrow night is the
               full moon.  You'll change,
               you'll become....

                         DAVID
                    (interrupting)
               A monster.  I know, I know.

                         JACK
               You must take your own life
               now, David, before it's too
               late.

                         DAVID
               Jack, are you really dead?

                         JACK
               What do you think?

                         DAVID
               I think I've lost my mind.  I
               think you're not real.  I
               think I'm asleep and you're a
               part of another bad dream.

                         JACK
               You must believe me.

                         DAVID
               What, Jack?  That tomorrow
               night beneath the full moon
               I'll sprout hair and fangs and
               eat people?  Bullshit!

                         JACK
               The canines will be real.
               You'll taste real blood!  God
               damit, David, please believe
               me!  You'll kill and make
               others like me!  I'm not
               having a nice time, David!
               Don't allow this to happen
               again!  You must take your own
               life!

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               I will not accept this!  Now
               go away!

41   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex wakes up from the shouting.

                         ALEX
               David?

42   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                         JACK
                    (quietly)
               This is not pretend, David.

                         DAVID
                    (righteous)
               I will not be threatened by a
               walking meat loaf!

     Alex enters the room.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?  I heard
               voices.

     David turns and sees that Jack is gone.

                         DAVID
                    (triumphant)
               It was just me, Alex.  It was
               just me.


43   EXT. EAST PROCTOR - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red
     M.G.  He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb.

44   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
     The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the
     Chess Player is still at the chessboard.  Dr. Hirsch
     enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his
     gloves:

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A drink for a very cold man?

     The Woman comes in from the back.

                         WOMAN
               Hello, there.  What can I get
               you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Campari and soda would do
               nicely.

                         WOMAN
               Sorry, love.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I suppose Guinness will
               suffice.

     She serves him his beer.  As he lays down his money...

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A thousand thanks.

     After a few sips.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nasty bit of business with
               those two young American boys.

     The Dart Player stops his wiping.

                         DART PLAYER
               I'm afraid I don't know what
               you mean, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, I'm sure that's right.  A
               few weeks ago, the last full
               moon wasn't it?

     The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look
     at Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I mean that escaped lunatic.
               The one that killed the boy.
               Wasn't that near here?

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (concerned)
               And where are you from, sir?

     Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
     table.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               London.  Knight takes pawn.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               What?

     Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, yes, yes.

     Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What's that?

                         WOMAN
                    (nervously)
               Oh, that's been there for two
               hundred years.  We were going
               to paint it out, but it's
               traditional, so we left it.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I see.  You've heard nothing
               about the incident?

                         DART PLAYER
               Incident?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The murder?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Are you a police officer?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (smiles)
               No, no, hardly.  I work in the
               hospital where the Kessler boy
               was brought.

     The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He was talking about
               werewolves and monsters and as
               I was near here I thought....

                         DART PLAYER
               You thought what?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I thought I'd look into the
               boy's story.

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (scoffs)
               A story about werewolves - now
               really, sir.

     Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Would you like a game of
               chess?

45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.
     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.

                         ALEX
               Let me go now, you'll make me
               late.

                         DAVID
               Do me an enormous favor?

                         ALEX
               Anything.

                         DAVID
               Tell me that it's silly of me
               to be apprehensive.

                         ALEX
               It's silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

                         DAVID
               Werewolves simply do not
               exist.

                         ALEX
                    (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay
               here tonight?

                         DAVID
               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND
     DAVID

     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.

                         ALEX
               Listen, if you get too
               anxious, call me at the
               hospital, okay?

                         DAVID
               Okay.

                         ALEX
               I've left those pills for you.

                         DAVID
               A doper werewolf.

     They kiss again.
                         ALEX
               I'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.

                         DAVID
               See you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.

                         DAVID
                    (to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.

                         DAVID
               Thanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.

                         DAVID
               Wonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

                         DAVID
               An American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

                         DAVID
               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.

47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK

     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.

                         DAVID
                    (weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.

50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     He reopens the fridge.

                         DAVID
               I'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.

                         DAVID
                    (singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.

                         DAVID
               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.

52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

                         ALEX
               How are we feeling tonight?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No!

                         ALEX
                    (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face
               and neck?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.

                         ALEX
               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

                         BENJAMIN & ALEX
               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.

53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT

     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

                         DAVID
               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.

                         DAVID
               I'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

                         DAVID
               Help me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.

                         DAVID
                    (pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.


54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An
     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver
     and the cab drives off.

                         WOMAN
               Which one, Harry?

                         MAN
               Number thirty-nine, but let's
               go `round the back.

                         WOMAN
               Why?

                         MAN
               Come on, we'll give Sean a
               scare.

                         WOMAN
               You're crazy, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the
     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and
     quiet.

55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear something?

                         HARRY
               Just now?

                         WOMAN
               Yes.

                         HARRY
               No.  Here we are, Sean's is
               the one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the
     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.

56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT

     Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out
     onto the park - a middle-aged couple.

                         WIFE
               Sean, those hooligans are in
               the park again.

                         SEAN
               Aren't you ready yet?  They'll
               be here any minute.

                         WIFE
               Something's going on out
               there.

57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense
     medication into paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches.
     He is still wearing his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is Miss Price on duty this
               evening?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Yes, Doctor.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, do you know if
               Miss Price has seen the
               Kessler boy since his release?

     Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Uh, I don't know if....

     Alex has walked up and overheard the last.

                         ALEX
               It's all right, Susan.  Yes,
               Doctor, I have.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come to my office, Miss Price.

     Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently
     follows Dr. Hirsch down the hallway.

58   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
     wife's complaints.  She hangs by the door.  He walks
     deeper into the park.

                         SEAN
                    (calls out)
               Is anyone there?

59   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Sit down, Alex.

     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I was in East Proctor today.

     Alex looks confused.  Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of
     her concern.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh dear girl, your
               extracurricular activities are
               of no consequence to me.  I
               don't give a damn who you
               sleep with.  I'm concerned
               about David.

                         ALEX
               Yes, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's a full moon.  Where is
               he?

                         ALEX
               At my flat.  I'm off at
               midnight and....

     Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The number, Alex.  Your
               number!

60   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean carefully approaches something near the trees.  He
     steps on something and looks down to see what it is.
     It is an arm.

61   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE
     TELEPHONE

     rings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring
     unanswered.

62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He's not there.

     Alex grows worried.

                         ALEX
               He's not?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, has David persisted in
               his werewolf fantasies?

                         ALEX
               Well, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Has his friend appeared to him
               again?

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What did he say?

                         ALEX
               David says Jack comes to warn
               him.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Warn him?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               They were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.

                         ALEX
               And what else?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?

                         ALEX
               No.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.

                         ALEX
               Surely you're not
               suggesting....

                         DR. HIRSCH
               David has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?

                         ALEX
                    (bewildered)
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, I don't mean running about
               on all fours and howling at
               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.

                         ALEX
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Let's call the police and see
               if they can help us find our
               wandering boy.


63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old
     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its
     ears perk up and he growls in warning.

                         DERELICT #1
               Old Winston smells something.

                         DERELICT #2
                    (calls out)
               Who's there?

     The dog begins to whine.

                         DERELICT #2
               Let `im go.

     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in
     terror.

                         DERELICT #3
               Brave dog that.

                         DERELICT #1
                    (worried)
               Here - who's there?

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.  We've heard this
     sound on the moors.

                         DERELICT #2
               That's not Winston.

                         DERELICT #3
               Look there.

     He points out into the night.  They strain their eyes -
     something is approaching them.  They can just make out
     its size.

                         DERELICT #1
               Mother Mary of God.

64   INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the
     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the
     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his
     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - LONG SHOT

     as the Passenger puts his coin in the vending machine.
     The camera is on ground level and as we watch the
     Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us.

                                                  CUT TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar.  He turns
     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned
     about his imagination.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,
     then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving
     stairway.

     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S SNOUT

     In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and
     black tongue.  It waits, panting, drool falls from its
     mouth.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
     down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
     Level".  He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear
     it.  He stops, frightened.

                         PASSENGER
               Hello?

     THE PASSENGER

                         PASSENGER
               Is there someone there?

     We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing.  The Passenger is
     beginning to panic.

                         PASSENGER
               I can assure you that this is
               not in the least bit amusing!

     He looks around wildly.

                         PASSENGER
               I shall report this!

     PASSENGER'S P.O.V.

     We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the
     tunnel towards us.

                         PASSENGER
               Good Lord.

     THE PASSENGER

     turns to flee, his jog becoming a run.  He is
     terrified.

     WOLF - CLOSEUP

     of the Wolf's running steps.

     THE PASSENGER

     frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying
     his nose.  He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.
     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving
     stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and
     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.

     (A scare.)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars
     again.  We are at:

     EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
     We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
     panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
     where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
     by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is
     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his
     eyes.

                         DAVID
               Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
     He stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his
     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a
     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
     himself on a thorn.

                         DAVID
               Ouch!

66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying
     to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The
     phone rings and she runs for it.

                         ALEX
                    (excited, then
                     disappointed)
               Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he
               hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I
               will, doctor, but I just feel
               so helpless sitting here doing
               nothing.  Thank you, yes,
               goodbye.

     She hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is
     now more worried than ever.

67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if
     the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the
     bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

     He returns to the bushes.

     CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING

     A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is
     staring intently at the gorilla.  The Little Boy leaves
     the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at
     several other animals.  Eventually he comes to the Wolf
     cage.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Pssst!

     The Little Boy looks around.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Hey, kid!  Pssst.  Little boy
               with the balloons.

     The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"

     David cannot be seen.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Come over here.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush replies:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               If you come over here, I'll
               give you a pound.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Two pounds?

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Listen, two pounds is a lot of
               money.  It's almost five
               dollars.

                         LITTLE BOY
                    (very English)
               I don't know who you are.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               I'm the famous balloon thief.

                         LITTLE BOY
               Why would a thief want to give
               me two pounds?

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (losing patience)
               Come here and I'll show you.

     The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery,
     but stops a few feet away.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (pleading)
               Come on!

     The Little Boy edges forward.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               A little closer.

     When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
     balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.

                         DAVID
               Thank you.

     David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his
     balloons, startling several animal lovers.

68   EXT. PARK - DAY

     An ELDERLY COUPLE sits feeding birds, their coats
     folded nearly over the park bench.  A naked blur darts
     by, grabbing the top coat as it passes, scaring off the
     birds.

               A naked, American man stole my
               balloons.

                         MOTHER
               What?

               A naked, American man -- the
               famous balloon thief.

70   EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     The signs they always have on London newsstands
     proclaim "Man or Monster?"  Dr. Hirsch picks up a
     newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims
     Found Partially Devoured".

     He pays for the papers.  The second one's headline,
     "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?"

     in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of
     fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the
     bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to
     floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the
     crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and
     the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high
     heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a
     conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David
     clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar
     trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks
     at him oddly.

                         DAVID
                    (cheerfully)
               A lot of weather we've been
               having lately.

     The man studies David carefully.

72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading.
     There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to
     open it and David enters quickly, closing the door
     behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat.

                         ALEX
               David!  Where on earth have
               you been!?!

                         DAVID
               I'm freezing.

     He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and
     gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is
     excited, even euphoric.

                         DAVID
               Alex, I've lost my mind.  I
               woke up at the zoo!  But you
               know what?  I feel terrific!

                         ALEX
               The zoo?

                         DAVID
               Waking up at the zoo, that's
               not so insane.  Having no
               clothes on?  That's insane.
               What did I do last night,
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Don't you remember?

                         DAVID
               I said goodbye to you.  I was
               locked out of the flat.  I
               climbed the wall and came in
               through the bathroom window.
               I started to read and then I
               was naked at the zoo!
                    (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
     shoulders.

                         ALEX
               I worried about you.  We
               didn't know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back
     with equal passion.

                         ALEX
               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and
     Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
                         ALEX
               He's here.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (excited)
               Is he all right?  Why didn't
               you call me?  Where was he?

                         ALEX
               He doesn't remember.  He woke
               up at the zoo.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The zoo?  Is he rational?

                         ALEX
               Yes, he is.  He's very excited
               and confused, but he's not
               crazy, if that's what you
               mean.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Have you read the papers
               today?  Have you listened to
               the radio or television?

                         ALEX
               No, why?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is David acting strangely?

                         ALEX
               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think so.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Right.  Now listen carefully.
               I want you to bring David
               here.  I want him in my care.
               I'll notify the police that
               we've found him.  It is
               imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital.  Do
               you understand?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're certain he's lucid?
               You won't need any help?

                         ALEX
               He's fine.  We'll come right
               over.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Shall I send a car?

                         ALEX
               No, a cab will be faster.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
     dials again.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Scotland Yard?

                    (grins)
               I should be committed.

               I don't know why I feel so
               good.  I haven't felt this
               good in a long time.

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

                         DAVID
               My body feels alive, alert.  I
               feel like an athlete.

               What murders?

                         DRIVER
               Last night.  Haven't you
               heard?  Six people in
               different parts of the city
               mutilated.  A real maniac this
               one.

                         DAVID
               Pull over.

                         DAVID
               Pay the man.

     David gets out of the cab.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
     after David.

                         ALEX
               David, what are you doing?

                         DAVID
               Six people mutilated?  It had
               to be me, Alex.

                         ALEX
               David, stop!

     He turns and faces her.

                         DAVID
               I am going to the cops.
               There's a full moon tonight.
               Jack was right.  I....

                         ALEX
                    (angry)
               Jack is dead!

                         DAVID
               Jack is dead.  Look, six
               people have been killed.  I'm
               going to the police.

     David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex
     has to jog to keep up with him.

                         ALEX
               David, please be rational.
               Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

                         DAVID
               Rational!?!  I'm a fucking
               werewolf, for Christ's sake!

     He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.

                         DAVID
               Officer, I killed those people
               last night.

                         BOBBIE
                    (interested)
               You did, did you?

     Alex runs up.

                         ALEX
               He's playing a stupid joke,
               sir.

                         DAVID
                    (dumbfounded)
               What?

                         ALEX
               We had an argument.  He's
               being silly.

                         DAVID
                    (desperate)
               I swear, I don't know this
               girl.

                         BOBBIE
               All right, you two, move
               along.

                         DAVID
               Hey, you asshole!  I want you
               to arrest me!

                         BOBBIE
               There's no call for that kind
               of language.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               Queen Elizabeth is a man!
               Prince Charles is a faggot!
               Winston Churchill was full of
               shit!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing patience)
               Now see here young man.

                         DAVID
               Shakespeare was French!  The
               Queen Mother sucks cocks in
               hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!

     The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians
     start to gather.

                         BOBBIE
               That's quite enough!

                         ALEX
                    (pleading)
               David, please!

                         DAVID
               Who is this girl?

                         BOBBIE
               You're going to have to stop
               this disturbance or I shall
               arrest you.

                         DAVID
                    (frustrated, yelling)
               That's what I want you to do,
               you moron!

                         ALEX
                    (to Bobbie)
               Sir, he's very upset.  His
               friend was killed and....

                         DAVID
               Will you shut up!?!!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing his temper)
               That's enough!  Now go about
               your business.

                         ALEX
               Yes, David, let's go.

                         DAVID
                    (disbelief)
               You're not going to arrest me?

     David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.

                         DAVID
               Don't you think he should
               arrest me?
                         ONLOOKER
               Well, I'm not sure.  How does
               he know this isn't a prank?

                         DAVID
                    (despair)
               A prank?

                         ALEX
                    (urgently)
               David....

     The Bobbie has lost all patience.

                         BOBBIE
               I've no time for this
               foolishness.
                    (to onlookers)
               Nothing to look at.  Move
               along.

     The Bobbie walks away.  David is beside himself.

                         DAVID
               Hopeless.  It's hopeless.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               David, let's go now.

     David turns in a rage.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone, dammit!  You
               people are crazy!  I've got to
               get away from here!  I've got
               to do something!

                         ALEX
                    (worried)
               David, don't lose control.

                         DAVID
                    (approaching, hysteria)
               Control!?!  What control!?!
               Get away from me!

     He begins to cry.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their
     brakes, just missing him.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     It's too late.  He's lost in traffic.  Alex stands for
     a moment not knowing which way to turn.

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     David is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in
     an alley.  He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.
     Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               The forensic lads seem to feel
               that some sort of animal was
               involved, that's true, but I
               hardly think....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               Regardless of what you think,
               Lieutenant, the fact remains
               that David is missing and that
               we must find him.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Before nightfall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Precisely.

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (harried)
               Gentlemen, please.  We shall
               find Mr. Kessler as quickly as
               we're able.

                         ALEX
               He tried to have himself
               arrested.  He....

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (interrupts)
               Getting arrested isn't all
               that difficult, Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               He wants help.  He....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               What can we do to assist you?

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (rising)
               Stay here.  If we need you,
               we'll know where to reach you.

     He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               I cannot accept a connection
               between David Kessler and last
               night's murders.  We will find
               him, however.  I can assure
               you of that.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We'll find him, not to worry.

     The two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.

                         ALEX
                    (distraught)
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (comforting)
               Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

     David is in a telephone booth.

                         DAVID
               Yes, operator.  I'd like to
               call the United States and
               reverse the charges.  David
               Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll
               wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code
               315/472-3402.  Thank you.
                    (pause)
               Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,
               you'll accept the charges.
               Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom
               or Dad home?  Where are they?
               Where's Max?  You're all
               alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't
               leave me alone when I was ten.
               No, not ten and a half either.
               I'm still in London.  I'm all
               better.  Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them?
               I don't care, Rachel, just do
               it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,
               Rachel, don't fight with Max.
               Well, try.  Look, kid, please
               don't forget to tell Mom and
               Dad I love them.  I love Max
               and you, too.  Well, I do.
               No, I'm not being weird, you
               little creep.  You promise?
               Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love
               you.  Bye.

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.

81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.

                         TICKET LADY
               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.

                         DAVID
               Will you take a traveler's
               check?

                         TICKET LADY
               No, sorry.

     David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.

                         DAVID
               Keep the change.

                         TICKET LADY
               Well, thank you, sir!

     She gives him a ticket.  David goes in.

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.

                         DAVID
               Hi, Jack.

                         JACK
               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

                         DAVID
               What can I say, Jack?

                         JACK
               You don't have to say
               anything.

                         DAVID
               Aren't you going to say, `I
               told you so'?

                         JACK
               If I was still alive, I
               probably would.

                         DAVID
               You look awful.

                         JACK
               Thank you.

                         DAVID
                    (apologizes quickly)
               I didn't mean it.  I don't
               know what I'm saying.  I'm not
               even sure it was me who killed
               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.

                         JACK
               What about the zoo?

                         DAVID
               Well, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to
               do something like that.  I
               mean, here I sit in Leicester
               Square talking to a corpse.
               I'm glad to see you, Jack.

                         JACK
               I want you to meet some
               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.

                         JACK
               David Kessler, this is Gerald
               Bringsly.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Gerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it
               best you didn't see him as
               he's a fresh kill and still
               pretty messy.

                         BRINGSLY
                    (in shadow; very English)
               Yes, I do look most
               unpleasant.

     The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
     the seat to a puddle on the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               Why are you doing this to me,
               Jack?

                         BRINGSLY
               This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
               He is your good friend,
               whereas I am a victim of your
               carnivorous lunar activities.

                         DAVID
                    (appalled)
               Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I
               have absolutely no idea what
               to say to you.

                         BRINGSLY
               You've left my wife a widow
               and my children fatherless.
               And I understand that I am to
               walk the earth one of the
               living dead until the wolf's
               bloodline is severed and the
               curse lifted.

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.

                         BRINGSLY
               You must die, David Kessler.

                         JACK
               David, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.

                         JACK
               And these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All
     are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
     illuminating their gore.

                         DERELICT #2
               Can't say we're pleased to
               meet you, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
                    (defeated)
               What shall I do?

                         JACK
               Suicide.

                         HARRY
                    (adamantly)
               You must take your own life!

                         DAVID
               That's easy for you to say -
               you're already dead.

                         BRINGSLY
               No, David.  Harry and I and
               everyone you murder are not
               dead.  The undead.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Why are you doing this to me?

                         JACK
               Because this must be stopped.

                         DAVID
               How shall I do it?

                         JUDITH
               Sleeping pills?

                         DERELICT #1
               Not sure enough.

                         DAVID
               I could hang myself.

                         JACK
               If you did it wrong, it would
               be painful.  You'd choke to
               death.

                         DERELICT #3
               So what?  Let `im choke.

                         JACK
               Do you mind?  The man's a
               friend of mine.

                         DERELICT #3
               Well he ain't no friend of
               mine.

                         BRINGSLY
               Gentlemen, please.

                         HARRY
               A gun.

                         DERELICT #1
               I know where he can get a gun.

                         DAVID
               Don't I need a silver bullet
               or something?

                         JACK
               Be serious, would you?

     David puts his head in his hands.

                         DAVID
               Madness.  I've gone totally
               mad.

                         HARRY
               A gun is good.

                         JUDITH
               You just put the gun to your
               forehead and pull the trigger.

                         BRINGSLY
               If you put it in your mouth,
               then you'd be sure not to
               miss.

                         DAVID
               Thank you, you're all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.


                                                  CUT TO:

83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT

     The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.

84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three
     small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle
     staring at him.

                         DAVID
                    (gasps out in anguish)
               Go away!  Please!  Go away!

     The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow
     more severe.

                         DAVID
                    (his face contorting)
               Run!  Please...run.

     His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick
     hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in
     fascination.

85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The
     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:
                         TICKET TAKER
               I'll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.

86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!

                                                  CUT TO:

87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

     From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and
     single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema
     through the busy traffic.

88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

                         TICKET LADY
               It's horrible, horrible!
               There's a beast!  A mad dog!
               It's killing people in there!

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

90   EXT. CINEMA

     As the cop bolts the door shut.

                         COP #1
               For God's sake, Tom, there's a
               monster in there!
     The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them
     down.  The cops strain to keep them shut.

                         COP #1
               Call for assistance and tell
               them to bring guns.

     Pedestrians start milling around.  The door is bulging.
     The Wolf's roars continue.

                         COP #2
               Keep moving!  Will you people
               get out of the way!

91   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep.  Dr. Hirsch wakes her.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nurse Hobbs said there's a
               disturbance in Leicester
               Square involving some sort of
               mad dog.

                         ALEX
               David?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I doubt it.  But it's
               something to do.

92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are
     distributed to uniformed men.

93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are
     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
     closed against the Wolf's battering.

     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers
     and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               What the hell is going on
               here?

                         COP
               It's some kind of animal, sir.
               We....
     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.

94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.

                         ALEX
               David!  It's David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.


95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley.  Alex runs to them.

                         ALEX
               Let me through!

                         COP
               Stand clear, miss!

                         ALEX
               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The
     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the
     police line.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

                         ALEX
               David?  Is it you?  Is it
               true, David?

     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.

                         ALEX
               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex
     realizes it will kill her.

                         OFFICER
               Fire!

     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on
     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and
     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.

     on the moon.

     EXT. MOON

     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.

2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.


                                                  CUT TO:

     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.

     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER

     They've been cramped for hours.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
               Here, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.

                         JACK
               Yes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
                    (as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.

                         DAVID
               Thanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.

     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     As they walk, their breath visible:

                         JACK
               Are you cold?

                         DAVID
               Yes.

                         JACK
               Good.

     They walk on, finally:

                         DAVID
               Jack.

                         JACK
               David.

                         DAVID
               You're not having a good time
               are you?

                         JACK
               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.

                         DAVID
               Well, I like it here.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.

                         DAVID
               Right.

     They walk on.
                         JACK
               Do you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?

                         DAVID
               I think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.

                         JACK
               Debbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.

                         DAVID
               She's a jerk.

                         JACK
               You're talking about the woman
               I love.

                         DAVID
               I'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.

                         JACK
               Well, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.

                         JACK
                    (like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
               The love affair that shocked
               Europe!  See torrid lovemaking
               at its most explicit!  See
               Jack and Debbie expose their
               lust in the sacred halls of
               the Vatican!  Never has the
               screen dared....

                         DAVID
               If you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.

                         JACK
               I have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.

                         DAVID
               It just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.

                         JACK
               It is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.

                         DAVID
               We've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?

                         JACK
               She says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.

     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.

4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".

                         JACK
               The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's a wolf's head.

                         DAVID
               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?

                         JACK
               That's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.

                         DAVID
               A severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.

                         JACK
               David, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.

                         DAVID
               I assume full responsibility.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         DAVID
               Shall we?

5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Nice to see you.

     FACES

     Silent and staring.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID AND JACK

                         DAVID
                    (smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.

                         JACK
               Do you have any hot soup?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         DAVID
               Well, do you have any coffee?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Hot chocolate?
                         WOMAN
               We've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.

                         JACK
               Then you have some hot tea?

                         WOMAN
               No.

                         JACK
               Oh.

                         WOMAN
               But I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.

                         DAVID & JACK
               Yes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.

                         JACK
               Nice looking group.

                         DAVID
               Listen, at least it's warm in
               here.

                         JACK
               Look at that.

                                                  CUT TO:

     JACK'S P.O.V.

     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.

                         DAVID
               What about it?

                         JACK
               It's a five-pointed star.

                         DAVID
               Maybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.

                         JACK
                    (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

                         WOMAN
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               He was joking.  Thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               She means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.

                         DAVID
               Oh, yes, of course.

                         JACK
               Right, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Bloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?

                         WOMAN
               No, but we're about to.

     Laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               You be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.

                         WOMAN
                    (heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               All right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.

                         WOMAN
               Oh, come on, tell us.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Right.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.

                         WOMAN
               That's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.

                         JACK
                    (to David)
               Go on, ask them.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Here now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....

                         DART PLAYERS
               Hear!  Hear!

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...
                         DART PLAYER
               Remember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.

                         JACK
               Excuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               You've made me miss.

                         JACK
               I'm sorry.

                         DART PLAYER
               I've never missed the board
               before.

                         DAVID
               Jack, we'd better go.

                         JACK
               What do you mean?  I'm
               starving.

                         DART PLAYER
               There's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.

                         DAVID
               Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

                         JACK
               Apparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.

                         WOMAN
                    (to men)
               You can't let them go.

                         DAVID
                    (worried)
               How much do we owe you?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.

                         DAVID
               Uh, thank you.

                         WOMAN
               Wait!  You just can't let them
               go!

                         DART PLAYER
               Go!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.

                         DAVID
               Yes, well, thanks again.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Beware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.

6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is very cold.

                         JACK
               What the hell was that all
               about?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon?

                         DAVID
               Come on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.

7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     It is quiet.

                         WOMAN
               You can't let them go.

                         DART PLAYER
                    (angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!

                         CHESS PLAYER
               It's murder then.

                         DART PLAYER
               Then murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

     walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

                         DAVID
               That was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.

                         JACK
               I don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.

                         DAVID
               Well, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.

                         JACK
               What do you think was wrong?

                         DAVID
               I have no idea.

                         JACK
               Maybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.

                         DAVID
               I see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

                         DAVID
               Please don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.

                         DAVID
               Of course.

     They walk getting soaked.

                         JACK
               Say, David....

                         DAVID
               I'm well aware of how pleasant
               the weather is in Rome at the
               present time thank you.

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.

                         JACK
               Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.

9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

     The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.

                         WOMAN
               Perhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:

                         CHESS PLAYER
               No one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!

                         WOMAN
               You could have told them!

                         DART PLAYER
               Are you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.

                         WOMAN
               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear it?  We must go
               to them.

                         DART PLAYER
               I heard nothing.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.

10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.

                         JACK
               Did you hear that?

                         DAVID
               I heard that.

                         JACK
               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

                         DAVID
               Could be a lot of things.

                         JACK
               Yeah?

                         DAVID
               A coyote.

                         JACK
               There aren't any coyotes in
               England.

                         DAVID
               The Hound of the Baskervilles.

                         JACK
               Pecos Bill.

                         DAVID
               Heathcliffe.

                         JACK
               Heathcliffe didn't howl.

                         DAVID
               No, but he was on the moors.

                         JACK
               It's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

                         JACK
               I vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.

                         DAVID
               Yeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.

                         DAVID
               We're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.

                         JACK
               Shit!  David, what is that?

                         DAVID
               I don't know.  Come on.

                         JACK
               Come on, where?

                         DAVID
               Anywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.

                         DAVID
               It's moving.

                         JACK
               It's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.

                         JACK
               Fuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.

                         DAVID
               What's the plan?

                         JACK
                    (nervously)
               Plan?

                         DAVID
                    (not too relaxed
                     himself)
               Let's just keep walking.

     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

                         DAVID
               That's right, a lovely stroll
               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.

                         DAVID
               It's in front of us.

                         JACK
               Do you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

     BOYS' P.O.V.

     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.

                         JACK
               Oh shit.  What is that?

                         DAVID
               A sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

                         JACK
               Nice doggie.  Good boy.

                         DAVID
               Walk away, Jack.

                         JACK
               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.

                         DAVID
               See anything?

                         JACK
               No.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.

                         DAVID
               It sounds far away.

                         JACK
               Not far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.

                         DAVID
               Jack?

                         JACK
               Yeah.

                         DAVID
               Where are we going?

                         JACK
               I'll tell you when we get
               there.

                         DAVID
               Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.

                         JACK
               You really scared me, you
               shithead.

                         DAVID
               Are you going to help me up?

     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!

     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.

                         JACK
               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please
               help me!  Please!  David!
               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.

                         DAVID
               Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
     mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.

                         DAVID
               Jack....

     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs
     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
     hulking form rolls off of him.

     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers
     crowd around, David falls back and faints.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls
     out....

                         DAVID
               Jack?!

     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a
     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

                         ALEX
               Mr. Kessler?

     David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS
     GALLAGHER, comes in.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He all right?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think.  He
               called out just now.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               He's an American, you know.
               Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
               round one of those Embassy
               fellows to see him.

                         ALEX
               Chart says he's from New York.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I think he's a Jew.

                         ALEX
               Why on earth do you say that?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               I looked.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Really, Susan, I don't think
               that was very proper, and
               besides, it's common practice
               now.

     A voice startles the girls.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
               Price is quite right.

     DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the
     customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring
     presence.  The girls are embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
               out a minute ago.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, surely you
               must perform some function
               here at the hospital.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Then get on with it.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, Doctor.

     She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex
     watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Can I be of service, Miss
               Price?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Go about your duties.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

     She starts to exit.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, Miss Price?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What exactly did he call out?

                         ALEX
               He said `Jack'.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               That would be Jack Goodman,
               the boy who was killed.

                         ALEX
               What happened to them?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The police report said an
               escaped lunatic attacked them.
               He must have been a very
               powerful man.  Although I
               really don't see that it is
               any of your concern, Miss
               Price.

                         ALEX
               No, sir.  Of course, sir.
               Good day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
     looking into David's eyes.

12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the
     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The
     camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
     the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and
     harder, then too loud when we:

                                                  CUT TO:

13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing
     beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr.
     Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch
               and this is a countryman of
               yours, Mr. Collins.

                         DAVID
               Where am I?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're in a hospital in
               London.

                         DAVID
               London?  Where's Jack?  I had
               a strange dream.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I should think so after your
               recent traumatic experiences.

                         DAVID
               The guy I was with.  Is he all
               right?  How did I get to
               London?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (quietly)
               Now, David, I want you to
               prepare yourself; your friend
               is dead.
     David jolts up in bed and shouts.

                         DAVID
               What?

     The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

                         DAVID
               Ow, shit!

     He sinks back down.

                         DAVID
               Jack's dead?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Kessler, I am Mr. Collins
               of the American Embassy here
               in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.
               Goodman's parents and your
               parents have been notified of
               your injuries and everything's
               in order.

                         DAVID
               Everything's in order?  What
               are you talking about?

                         MR. COLLINS
               Mr. Goodman's body has been
               air-freighted back to New York
               for burial and your parents
               have wired funds for your stay
               in the hospital until you are
               well enough to fly home.

                         DAVID
                    (controlled tears)
               You don't crate and ship Jack
               like some side of beef.
                    (approaching hysteria)
               Who the hell are you people?
               What's going on here?  Where
               is Jack?  I demand to see him!

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (holds David down,
                     calls out)
               Miss Price!  Miss Price,
               please!

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Get your fucking hands off me!
               What the hell is going on
               here?

     Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.

                         MR. COLLINS
                    (distraught, clutching
                     his briefcase)
               I realize how upsetting this
               must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
               but please try to refrain from
               hysterics.

     David continues shouting and struggling.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Prepare a hypodermic, please,
               Miss Price.

     The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
     Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
     normal.

                         MR. COLLINS
               Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
               excite yourself.  Everything
               has been arranged.  I shall
               come back to check on your
               progress and send a report to
               your parents.  The police have
               requested to interview you and
               I have given them permission
               to do so.

     Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Thank you very much, Mr.
               Collins.  He'll rest now and
               I'm sure everything will be
               fine once he's adjusted.  He's
               had quite a shock.

                         MR. COLLINS
               These dumb-ass kids never
               appreciate anything you do for
               them.

     Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

                         DAVID
               How long have I been here?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've been unconscious since
               you were brought in two weeks
               ago.

                         DAVID
               Two weeks?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've suffered some rather
               severe cuts and bruises, lost
               a bit of blood, but nothing
               too serious; black and blue
               for a while.  You'll have some
               dueling scars to boast of.
               That lunatic must have been a
               very fierce fellow.  They say
               a mad man has the strength of
               ten.

                         DAVID
                    (softly, as the drugs
                     take hold)
               Lunatic?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now we've just given you a
               pretty strong sedative, so try
               to get some rest now.  Miss
               Price will see to your needs.
               Rest now.

     Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.

                         DAVID
                    (softly)
               It wasn't a lunatic.

                         ALEX
                    (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

                         DAVID
               It was a wolf.

                         ALEX
                    (bends down close
                     to hear)
               What?

                         DAVID
               A wolf.

     David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did he say a wolf?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

14   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is on the phone, he is referring to a desk
     calendar.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               But Roger is so terribly
               boring.  Yes, dear, but
               couldn't we...I see.
                    (he makes a note)
               Thursday at eight, dinner with
               boring Roger.  Yes, I'm sure I
               will; if I survived Rommel, I
               suppose I'll survive another
               excruciating evening with
               Roger Mathison.  Be a good
               girl.  Bye.

     He hangs up very disgruntled.  The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
               are here to see you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Send them in.

     He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
     the other rather pudgy.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come in, come in.  Please sit.
               Some tea?

     The cops sit down, Lt. Villiers immediately produces a
     small notebook.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               I'd like some tea, please.

     Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe
               later.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's no problem.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               No, thank you, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Well, then, what can I do for
               Scotland Yard?

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We understand the Kessler boy
               has regained consciousness.

     Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Sorry.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has Mr. Kessler said anything
               regarding the attack on the
               moors?

     The intercom buzzes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Excuse me.  Yes?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               Roger Mathison, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What here?

                         SECRETARY (V.O.)
               He's on the telephone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Tell him I'm out.  No, tell
               him I've passed away.  An old
               war wound or something.  Tell
               him I'm dead.  And no more
               calls!

     He turns from the intercom back to the cops.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You were saying?

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Has David Kessler anything to
               say concerning the attack on
               the moors?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Why don't we ask him?

15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
     stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry if I conflict with
               your report, but Jack and I
               were not attacked by a man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               So you've said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point,
               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys
               would be able to defend
               themselves against one man.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Sgt. McManus, are you
               suggesting that David and Jack
               were, in fact, attacked by
               some animal and that the
               officialdom of East Proctor
               has conspired to keep it a
               secret?  We have an autopsy
               report on the murderer who was
               shot in the act by the local
               police.  We have two witnesses
               to the crime.  You'll forgive
               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
               your testimony as coming from
               someone who has gone through a
               terrible shock.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Lieutenant, the boy seems
               pretty lucid to me and....

                         LT. VILLIERS
               And what, Sergeant?

                         SGT. McMANUS
                    (defeated)
               I don't rightly know, sir.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               That is precisely my point.
               David, as far as we are
               concerned, the matter is
               closed.  We won't trouble you
               any further.  Good day.

     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles
     at David and follows.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               Doctor.

     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.

                         DAVID
               There were witnesses?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               So they said.

                         DAVID
               How could there have been
               witnesses?  It was so dark.
               We were running and I fell and
               Jack went to help me up and
               this thing came from
               nowhere...I don't understand
               what they're talking about.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               In time I'm sure it will all
               come back to you.

                         DAVID
               Doctor, my memory is fine.
               It's my sanity I'm beginning
               to worry about.

                                                  CUT TO:

16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs
     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,
     looking about.

     CLOSEUP

     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

     DAVID

     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with
     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We
     see him completely as the animal, study his movement
     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops
     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly
     he pushes some leaves aside.

     CLOSEUP

     of his eyes.

     DAVID'S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The
     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders
     tensing.

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

     CLOSEUP

     of the frightened deer.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     CLOSEUP

     of David's eyes.

                                                  CUT BACK
                                                  TO:

     THE FAWN

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame
     as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame,
     his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered
     with blood.  He howls in triumph.

17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door
     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss
     Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to
     David, turns on the bed light and touches him.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.

                         DAVID
                    (awakened)
               I was having a nightmare.

     Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the
     pills and pouring a glass of water.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Yes, well these should help
               that.  That's right, drink up.

     David takes the pills.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Now go back to sleep so you'll
               be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the
               morning.

                         DAVID
               What time is it?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               It's nearly eight.  I'm off
               duty shortly, then I'm off to
               the films with Alex.

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Miss Price, the other nurse
               that attended you.

                         DAVID
               What are you going to see?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               An American film about the
               Mafia called `See You Next
               Wednesday', and I want to see
               it badly, so you give me no
               problems and go to sleep.

                         DAVID
                    (dropping off)
               Do you have bad dreams, too?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Some, everyone does.

                         DAVID
               Yes, but does everyone kill
               Bambi?

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Bambi?

     David has fallen asleep.  Miss Gallagher turns off the
     light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Kill Bambi?

     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into
     darkness.

18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY

     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys
     about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing
     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'
     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Take these round now, will you
               please?  The American boy in
               twenty-one is only to have
               these after he's eaten.  Will
               you be sure of that?

                         ALEX
               Has he been refusing food?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Nothing quite as dramatic as
               that, Miss Price.  He just
               doesn't eat enough of what is
               put before him.  He suffers
               from nightmares.  I'd think he
               just needs a hand to hold.

                         ALEX
               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
     appearance.  She enters.

19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY

     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

                         ALEX
               Hello, Benjamin.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Well, all right then, be that
               way.  Here, swallow this.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.
     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
     handing Alex back the glass.

                         ALEX
               Feeling better?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               The doctor will be round
               later.  Would you like a
               picture book to look at?  We
               have some lovely funny Beanos.

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
     Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
     Benjamin's ward.

20   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

                         ALEX
               Has the patient in twenty-one
               gotten his tray yet?

                         ORDERLY
               The American?  Yes, duck.

                         ALEX
               How did he look?

                         ORDERLY
               What do you mean, `how did he
               look'?

                         ALEX
               You know, did he seem
               depressed?  Do you think he'll
               eat the food?

                         ORDERLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm an orderly, not a bleeding
               psychiatrist!  I push things
               about, but I've little say
               what happens to them.

                         ALEX
               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
     She hesitates, then peeks in.

21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
     patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is
     apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               Mr. Kessler?

                         DAVID
                    (lifeless)
               Yes?

                         ALEX
               You haven't eaten your lunch.

                         DAVID
               I'm not very hungry, thank
               you.

                         ALEX
               I'm afraid you have to eat
               something.

                         DAVID
               Please, really.  I'm not
               hungry.

                         ALEX
               You put me in an awkward
               position, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
               How is that?

                         ALEX
                    (she shakes the paper cup)
               Well, you're to take these
               after you've eaten.  Now what
               kind of nurse would I be if I
               failed in so simple a task as
               giving out some pills?

                         DAVID
               Leave the pills.  I'll take
               them later.

                         ALEX
               Sorry.

     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Miss Price!

                         ALEX
               Call me Alex.

                         DAVID
               Aw come on, Alex!

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               Mr. Kessler?

     David is getting interested.

                         DAVID
               Call me David.

                         ALEX
               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               David?

                         DAVID
               This is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.

                         ALEX
               Right.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

                         ALEX
               Let's try a little harder,
               shall we?

                         DAVID
               Will you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.

                         ALEX
               Will I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:

                         DAVID
               May I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.

FADE OUT

     FADE IN

22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY

     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:

                         JACK (O.S.)
               David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
     the....

                                                  CUT TO:

23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
     out....

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Orderly, go at once to twenty-
               one and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Miss Gallagher, remain here at
               the desk.  I'll be in twenty-
               one.

     She exits.

24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
     thoughtfully out the window.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've never had bad dreams
               before?

                         DAVID
                    (upset)
               Sure, as a kid.  But never so
               real.  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Did you get a good look at the
               man who attacked you?

                         DAVID
               I've told you, it wasn't a
               man.  It was an animal.  A big
               wolf or something.  A rabid
               dog.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (chewing on his glasses)
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
               been traumatized, but Jack was
               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man
               can't do that to someone with
               his bare hands.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You'd be surprised what
               horrors a man is capable of.

                         DAVID
               Did you see Jack?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               No.  In fact, your wounds were
               cleaned and dressed before you
               arrived here.

                         DAVID
               Did you talk to the police in
               East Proctor?  Did the cops go
               to The Slaughtered Lamb?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I really don't know.

                         DAVID
               Then why the hell are you so
               quick to disbelieve me?  You
               yourself said it must have
               taken incredible strength to
               tear apart a person like that.
                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (rubs his forehead)
               David, please.  The police are
               satisfied.  I'm certain that
               if a monster were out roaming
               northern England we'd have
               seen it on the telly.

                         DAVID
               You really think I'm crazy,
               don't you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Believe me.  The Hound of the
               Baskervilles was an invention
               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
               And if you'd read the bloody
               book, you'd find that Holmes
               discovered your house of hell
               a fraud, a fake.

     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Now really, David.  You're far
               too intelligent to go on this
               way.  When you return to
               America I want you to seek out
               a competent psychiatrist or
               psychologist or something and
               stop this nonsense.  You'll be
               leaving this hospital in three
               or four days, please remain
               sane.  At least until you are
               no longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

                         DAVID
               Dr. Hirsch?
                    (pause)
               I'd rather not be by myself.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Of course not, David.  I'll
               fetch in young Miss Price.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and
     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex
     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
     feet, fingers and toes stretch.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               You're a very beautiful girl.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               I thought you were asleep.

                         DAVID
               I was.  What are you reading?

                         ALEX
               `A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.

                         DAVID
               Do you like it?

                         ALEX
               I've just started it.  My
               friend gave it to me.

     They look at each other.

                         ALEX
               What do you dream about?

                         DAVID
               I dream of death mostly.

                         ALEX
               I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have
               asked you.

                         DAVID
               It's okay.  I want to talk to
               you.

     They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               That's not really a very
               proper question.

                         DAVID
               How old are you?

                         ALEX
               Twenty-eight.

                         DAVID
               I'm twenty-seven.

                         ALEX
               I know.

                         DAVID
               Now what do you want to talk
               about?

                         ALEX
               Was Jack Goodman your good
               friend?

                         DAVID
                    (seriously)
               My best friend.  My very best
               friend.

                         ALEX
                    (embarrassed)
               Shall I read to you?

                         DAVID
               What?  Oh, yes, please.

                         ALEX
                    (opens book)
               A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
               Clemens.  This is after the
               preface but before chapter
               one: A Word of Explanation.
               You all right?

                         DAVID
                    (settles back)
               Yes, go on.

                         ALEX
                    (clears her throat)
               Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
               It was in Warwick Castle that
               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.

                         FATHER
               I'll get it.

     The pounding continues.

                         FATHER
               All right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.

                         DAVID
               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.

                                                  CUT TO:

27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to
     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
     anyway.

                         ALEX
                    (yawns, smiles)
               Hello.  You all right?

                         DAVID
               I'm sorry I woke you up.

                         ALEX
               Don't be silly.  Can I get you
               something?

                         DAVID
               No, thank you.  Just keep me
               company for a while.

                         ALEX
               That's easy enough.

                         DAVID
               I keep having these really
               terrible dreams.  They are
               getting worse and I can't seem
               to stop them.

                         ALEX
               David, your dreams will stop.
               You'll leave England and your
               bad memories; and then this
               will all fade away.

                         DAVID
               Will you come with me?

                         ALEX
                    (taken aback)
               What?

                         DAVID
                    (smiling)
               I'm serious.  You don't know
               me and I know nothing about
               you.  We have a perfect
               relationship.

                         ALEX
               Now, David, I said I would
               keep you company, but I meant
               right here and now.

                         DAVID
               Will you think about it?

                         ALEX
               How did we get from your bad
               dreams to my taking a holiday
               with a patient?

                         DAVID
                    (big grin)
               Not just a patient -- me.

                         ALEX
               You're being awfully forward,
               aren't you?

                         DAVID
               Forgive me, I'm trying to
               cheer myself up and an affair
               with a beautiful nurse seemed
               like just the thing to do it.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               All I am to you is a sex
               fantasy then?

                         DAVID
               Now I'm embarrassed.

                         ALEX
               Good.  I thought for a moment
               I was the only embarrassed one
               in the room.

     There is an awkward pause.

                         DAVID
               Where were we in the book?

     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

                         ALEX
                    (looking through
                     the book)
               Let me see here.

                                                  FADE OUT


     FADE IN

28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

                         ORDERLY
               Ah you're up.  Good morning
               and a good day to you.  We've
               quite a meal for you here this
               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,
               orange juice, and toast with
               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now
               eat it up and I'll be back for
               the dishes when you've
               finished.

     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been
     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
     notices his exit.

                         DAVID
               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a
     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

                         DAVID
                    (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.

                         JACK (O.S.)
               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.

                         JACK
                    (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.

                         DAVID
                    (unbelieving)
               Get the fuck out of here,
               Jack.

                         JACK
               Thanks a lot.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               This is too much.  I can't
               handle this.

                         JACK
               I'm aware that I don't look so
               great, but I thought you'd be
               glad to see me.

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat
     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at
     Jack horrified.

                         JACK
               David!  You're hurting my
               feelings.

                         DAVID
                    (astounded)
               Hurting your feelings?  Has it
               occurred to you that it may be
               unsettling to have you rise
               from your grave to visit me?
               Listen to me, I'm talking to a
               hamburger!

                         JACK
               I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
               David, but I had to come.

                         DAVID
                    (aghast)
               Aren't you supposed to be
               buried in New York someplace?

                         JACK
               Yeah.  Your parents came to my
               funeral.  I was surprised at
               how many people came.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Why should you be surprised?
               You were a very well-liked
               person.

                         JACK
               Debbie Klein cried a lot.

                         DAVID
               I can't stand it.

                         JACK
               So you know what she does?
               She's so grief stricken she
               runs to find solace in Rudy
               Levine's bed.

                         DAVID
               Rudy Levine the shmuck?

                         JACK
               Life mocks me even in death.

     Jack takes another bite of toast.

                         DAVID
                    (to himself)
               I'm going completely crazy.

                         JACK
                    (loud)
               David!

                         DAVID
                    (louder)
               What?!

                         JACK
               David, now I know this may be
               hard for you, but I have to
               warn you.

                         DAVID
                    (shouting)
               Warn me?  Will you get out of
               here, you meat loaf?

                         JACK
               I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
               but I love you and that's why
               I'm here.  You've got to know.

                         DAVID
               If you love me so much, Jack,
               you'll realize how
               disconcerting it is to share
               one's breakfast with the
               living dead!

                         JACK
               We were attacked by a
               werewolf.

                         DAVID
                    (covers his ears)
               I'm not listening!

                         JACK
               On the moors, we were attacked
               by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

                         DAVID
               Shut up, you zombie!

                         JACK
               I was murdered, an unnatural
               death, and now I walk the
               earth in limbo until the
               werewolf's curse is lifted.

                         DAVID
                    (incredulous, furious)
               What's wrong with you?  Shut
               up!

                         JACK
               The wolf's bloodline must be
               severed.  The last remaining
               werewolf must be destroyed.

                         DAVID
               Will you be quiet?!

     Jack rises and comes closer to David.

                         JACK
               It's you, David.

                         DAVID
               What?!

                         JACK
               You survived and now you shall
               continue the curse.

                         DAVID
               What are you talking about?  I
               won't accept this!  Get out!
               God damit!

                         JACK
               Remember what that guy at The
               Slaughtered Lamb said?
               `Beware the moon.'

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Stop it, Jack.

                         JACK
               Beware the moon.  The full
               moon, David.  You've got two
               days.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               Jack, please go away.  Please
               go away.

                         JACK
               You'll stalk the streets of
               London a creature of the
               night.

                         DAVID
                    (flares up)
               You're talking like Boris
               Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!

                         JACK
               David, please believe me.  You
               will kill people, David.
               You've got to stop the
               bloodshed before it begins.

                         DAVID
                    (yells)
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               Listen to me!  Take your own
               life, David.  It's our only
               chance.

                         DAVID
               Nurse!

                         JACK
               The supernatural!  The powers
               of darkness!  It's all true.
               Take your own life!  Suicide,
               David.  Join me.

                         DAVID
                    (losing it)
               Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!

                         JACK
               It's cold, David, and I'm so
               alone.  The undead surround
               me.  Have you ever talked to a
               corpse?  It's boring!  I'm
               lonely!  Kill yourself, David,
               before you kill others.

29   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - DAY

     Alex rushing down the hospital corridor.

30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     David rocking back and forth weeping.

                         JACK
               Don't cry, David.

31   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing down hospital corridor.

32   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

                         JACK
               Please don't cry.

33   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Alex rushing to the door.

34   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - CLOSEUP

                         JACK
                    (softly in looming
                     closeup)
               Beware the moon, David.

                                                  CUT TO:

     ALEX

     as she bursts into the room.

                                                  CUT TO:

     DAVID

     laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
     He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
     on the bed and hugs David.

                         ALEX
               David?  David!

     David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
     until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
     easier.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?

     David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

                         DAVID
                    (quietly)
               I'm a werewolf.

                         ALEX
               A werewolf?

     Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
     and backs off a little.  David composes himself.

                         ALEX
               Are you better now?

                         DAVID
               I'll let you know the next
               full moon.

                         ALEX
               You're to be discharged
               tomorrow.  Will you be all
               right?

     David takes Alex's hand.

                         DAVID
               My friend Jack was just here.

                         ALEX
               Your dead friend Jack?

                         DAVID
               Yeah.  He says that I will
               become a monster in two days.
               What do you think?

                         ALEX
               What do I think?  You mean
               about the possibility of your
               becoming a monster in two days
               or about visits from dead
               friends?

                         DAVID
               I was dreaming again?

                         ALEX
               I would think so.

                         DAVID
                    (resigned)
               Yeah, I would think so, too.

     Alex considers for a while, finally....

                         ALEX
               Do you have a place to stay in
               London?


                                                  CUT TO:

35   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     David and Alex walking down the street.  Alex points
     out her flat and leads David up the front steps.  She
     gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.

36   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex enters and David follows.  A small, utilitarian
     apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light.  David puts
     his backpack on the floor.
                         ALEX
               The kitchen.

                         DAVID
               Very nice.

     She proceeds to give the tour.

                         ALEX
               Closet.

                         DAVID
               Charming.

                         ALEX
               Bathroom.

                         DAVID
               Lovely.

                         ALEX
               The bedroom.

                         DAVID
               There is only one bed.

                         ALEX
                    (makes a face)
               David, perhaps you'd like to
               watch the telly while I take a
               shower.

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
     on his heels.

37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
     of water in the shower.

                         DAVID
               It's nice to see you.

                         ALEX
               It's nice to see you.

     MONTAGE IN SHOWER - DAY

     A sequence of soap and flesh.  Van Morrison's
     "Moondance" plays.  A montage of soapy hands on
     slippery skin.  Thighs rubbing thighs, arms and
     shoulders.  David and Alex kiss again and again and....

38   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's
     bed.  David pulls out and they lay holding each other.
     After a moment....

                         DAVID
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Yes?

                         DAVID
               Will you be here in about
               fifteen minutes?

                         ALEX
               Of course.

                         DAVID
                    (leers)
               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

                         ALEX
               David, you don't honestly
               believe that in reality your
               friend Jack rose from the
               grave to breakfast with you?
               Do you really?

                         DAVID
               I was awake and he was in my
               room.

                         ALEX
               But, David.

                         DAVID
                    (firm)
               I wasn't hallucinating.

     Pause.

                         ALEX
                    (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

                         DAVID
               That's good, Alex.  Reassure
               me.

     Alex begins kissing David's neck.

                         DAVID
               It's all right, I know I'm
               being insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

                         DAVID
               Okay, okay.  I'm properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
     lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to
     hold onto the headboard of the bed.

                         DAVID
                    (closing his eyes)
               This is very reassuring.  I'm
               feeling very reassured.

                                                  DISSOLVE
                                                  TO:

     INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts
     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes
     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.

39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,
     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.

                         DAVID
                    (points a trembling
                     finger)
               You're not real.

                         JACK
               Don't be an asshole, David.
               Come here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
     room.

40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM

     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He
     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
     to wake up Alex.

                         DAVID
               What are you doing here?

                         JACK
               I wanted to see you.

                         DAVID
               Okay, you've seen me.  Now go
               away.

                         JACK
               David, I'm sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must
               understand what is going on.

                         DAVID
               I understand all right.
               You're one of the undead and
               I'm a werewolf.

                         JACK
               Yes.

                         DAVID
               Get out of here, Jack!

                         JACK
               David, tomorrow night is the
               full moon.  You'll change,
               you'll become....

                         DAVID
                    (interrupting)
               A monster.  I know, I know.

                         JACK
               You must take your own life
               now, David, before it's too
               late.

                         DAVID
               Jack, are you really dead?

                         JACK
               What do you think?

                         DAVID
               I think I've lost my mind.  I
               think you're not real.  I
               think I'm asleep and you're a
               part of another bad dream.

                         JACK
               You must believe me.

                         DAVID
               What, Jack?  That tomorrow
               night beneath the full moon
               I'll sprout hair and fangs and
               eat people?  Bullshit!

                         JACK
               The canines will be real.
               You'll taste real blood!  God
               damit, David, please believe
               me!  You'll kill and make
               others like me!  I'm not
               having a nice time, David!
               Don't allow this to happen
               again!  You must take your own
               life!

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               I will not accept this!  Now
               go away!

41   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Alex wakes up from the shouting.

                         ALEX
               David?

42   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                         JACK
                    (quietly)
               This is not pretend, David.

                         DAVID
                    (righteous)
               I will not be threatened by a
               walking meat loaf!

     Alex enters the room.

                         ALEX
               David, what's wrong?  I heard
               voices.

     David turns and sees that Jack is gone.

                         DAVID
                    (triumphant)
               It was just me, Alex.  It was
               just me.


43   EXT. EAST PROCTOR - DAY

     Dr. Hirsch is driving down the main street in his red
     M.G.  He parks in front of The Slaughtered Lamb.

44   INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - DAY

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
     The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the
     Chess Player is still at the chessboard.  Dr. Hirsch
     enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his
     gloves:

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A drink for a very cold man?

     The Woman comes in from the back.

                         WOMAN
               Hello, there.  What can I get
               you?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Campari and soda would do
               nicely.

                         WOMAN
               Sorry, love.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I suppose Guinness will
               suffice.

     She serves him his beer.  As he lays down his money...

                         DR. HIRSCH
               A thousand thanks.

     After a few sips.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nasty bit of business with
               those two young American boys.

     The Dart Player stops his wiping.

                         DART PLAYER
               I'm afraid I don't know what
               you mean, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, I'm sure that's right.  A
               few weeks ago, the last full
               moon wasn't it?

     The Chess Player turns in his chair to get a good look
     at Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I mean that escaped lunatic.
               The one that killed the boy.
               Wasn't that near here?

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (concerned)
               And where are you from, sir?

     Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
     table.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               London.  Knight takes pawn.

                         CHESS PLAYER
               What?

     Sees that Dr. Hirsch was talking about his game....

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Oh, yes, yes.

     Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What's that?

                         WOMAN
                    (nervously)
               Oh, that's been there for two
               hundred years.  We were going
               to paint it out, but it's
               traditional, so we left it.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I see.  You've heard nothing
               about the incident?

                         DART PLAYER
               Incident?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The murder?

                         CHESS PLAYER
               Are you a police officer?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (smiles)
               No, no, hardly.  I work in the
               hospital where the Kessler boy
               was brought.

     The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He was talking about
               werewolves and monsters and as
               I was near here I thought....

                         DART PLAYER
               You thought what?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I thought I'd look into the
               boy's story.

                         CHESS PLAYER
                    (scoffs)
               A story about werewolves - now
               really, sir.

     Dr. Hirsch eyes the Chess Player.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Would you like a game of
               chess?

45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.
     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.

                         ALEX
               Let me go now, you'll make me
               late.

                         DAVID
               Do me an enormous favor?

                         ALEX
               Anything.

                         DAVID
               Tell me that it's silly of me
               to be apprehensive.

                         ALEX
               It's silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

                         DAVID
               Werewolves simply do not
               exist.

                         ALEX
                    (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay
               here tonight?

                         DAVID
               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND
     DAVID

     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.

                         ALEX
               Listen, if you get too
               anxious, call me at the
               hospital, okay?

                         DAVID
               Okay.

                         ALEX
               I've left those pills for you.

                         DAVID
               A doper werewolf.

     They kiss again.
                         ALEX
               I'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.

                         DAVID
               See you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.

                         DAVID
                    (to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.

                         DAVID
               Thanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.

                         DAVID
               Wonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

                         DAVID
               An American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

                         DAVID
               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.

47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK

     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.

                         DAVID
                    (weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.

50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK

     He reopens the fridge.

                         DAVID
               I'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK

     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.

                         DAVID
                    (singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.

                         DAVID
               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.

52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

                         ALEX
               How are we feeling tonight?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               No what?

                         BENJAMIN
               No!

                         ALEX
                    (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face
               and neck?

                         BENJAMIN
               No.

                         ALEX
               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.

                         ALEX
               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

                         BENJAMIN & ALEX
               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.

53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT

     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

                         DAVID
               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.

                         DAVID
               I'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

                         DAVID
               Help me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.

                         DAVID
                    (pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.


54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An
     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver
     and the cab drives off.

                         WOMAN
               Which one, Harry?

                         MAN
               Number thirty-nine, but let's
               go `round the back.

                         WOMAN
               Why?

                         MAN
               Come on, we'll give Sean a
               scare.

                         WOMAN
               You're crazy, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the
     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and
     quiet.

55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

                         WOMAN
               Did you hear something?

                         HARRY
               Just now?

                         WOMAN
               Yes.

                         HARRY
               No.  Here we are, Sean's is
               the one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the
     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.

56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT

     Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out
     onto the park - a middle-aged couple.

                         WIFE
               Sean, those hooligans are in
               the park again.

                         SEAN
               Aren't you ready yet?  They'll
               be here any minute.

                         WIFE
               Something's going on out
               there.

57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense
     medication into paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches.
     He is still wearing his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is Miss Price on duty this
               evening?

                         MRS. HOBBS
               Yes, Doctor.
                         DR. HIRSCH
               Miss Gallagher, do you know if
               Miss Price has seen the
               Kessler boy since his release?

     Miss Gallagher is not sure how to answer.

                         MISS GALLAGHER
               Uh, I don't know if....

     Alex has walked up and overheard the last.

                         ALEX
               It's all right, Susan.  Yes,
               Doctor, I have.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Come to my office, Miss Price.

     Alex and Susan exchange glances as she obediently
     follows Dr. Hirsch down the hallway.

58   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his
     wife's complaints.  She hangs by the door.  He walks
     deeper into the park.

                         SEAN
                    (calls out)
               Is anyone there?

59   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Sit down, Alex.

     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I was in East Proctor today.

     Alex looks confused.  Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of
     her concern.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh dear girl, your
               extracurricular activities are
               of no consequence to me.  I
               don't give a damn who you
               sleep with.  I'm concerned
               about David.

                         ALEX
               Yes, sir.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               It's a full moon.  Where is
               he?

                         ALEX
               At my flat.  I'm off at
               midnight and....

     Dr. Hirsch picks up the phone.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The number, Alex.  Your
               number!

60   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

     Sean carefully approaches something near the trees.  He
     steps on something and looks down to see what it is.
     It is an arm.

61   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - THE
     TELEPHONE

     rings loudly.  (This is a scare.)  It continues to ring
     unanswered.

62   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               He's not there.

     Alex grows worried.

                         ALEX
               He's not?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, has David persisted in
               his werewolf fantasies?

                         ALEX
               Well, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Has his friend appeared to him
               again?

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               What did he say?

                         ALEX
               David says Jack comes to warn
               him.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Warn him?

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.

                         ALEX
               Yes.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               They were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.

                         ALEX
               And what else?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?

                         ALEX
               No.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.

                         ALEX
               Surely you're not
               suggesting....

                         DR. HIRSCH
               David has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?

                         ALEX
                    (bewildered)
               Dr. Hirsch?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Oh, I don't mean running about
               on all fours and howling at
               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.

                         ALEX
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Let's call the police and see
               if they can help us find our
               wandering boy.


63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old
     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its
     ears perk up and he growls in warning.

                         DERELICT #1
               Old Winston smells something.

                         DERELICT #2
                    (calls out)
               Who's there?

     The dog begins to whine.

                         DERELICT #2
               Let `im go.

     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in
     terror.

                         DERELICT #3
               Brave dog that.

                         DERELICT #1
                    (worried)
               Here - who's there?

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.  We've heard this
     sound on the moors.

                         DERELICT #2
               That's not Winston.

                         DERELICT #3
               Look there.

     He points out into the night.  They strain their eyes -
     something is approaching them.  They can just make out
     its size.

                         DERELICT #1
               Mother Mary of God.

64   INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the
     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the
     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his
     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

     as the Passenger puts his coin in the vending machine.
     The camera is on ground level and as we watch the
     Passenger, the Wolf's legs flash by us.

     CLOSEUP

     of the Passenger eating his chocolate bar.  He turns
     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned
     about his imagination.

     Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,
     then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving
     stairway.

     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S SNOUT

     In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and
     black tongue.  It waits, panting, drool falls from its
     mouth.

     BACK TO SCENE

     The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
     down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
     Level".  He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear
     it.  He stops, frightened.

                         PASSENGER
               Hello?

     THE PASSENGER

                         PASSENGER
               Is there someone there?

     We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing.  The Passenger is
     beginning to panic.

                         PASSENGER
               I can assure you that this is
               not in the least bit amusing!

     He looks around wildly.

                         PASSENGER
               I shall report this!

     PASSENGER'S P.O.V.

     We see the Wolf at a great distance trotting down the
     tunnel towards us.

                         PASSENGER
               Good Lord.

     THE PASSENGER

     turns to flee, his jog becoming a run.  He is
     terrified.

     WOLF - CLOSEUP

     of the Wolf's running steps.

     THE PASSENGER

     frantically running, falls to the ground hard bloodying
     his nose.  He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.
     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving
     stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and
     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.

     (A scare.)  The tiger paces in its cage and roars
     again.  We are at:

     EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
     We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
     panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
     where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
     by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is
     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his
     eyes.

                         DAVID
               Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
     He stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his
     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a
     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
     himself on a thorn.

                         DAVID
               Ouch!

66   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying
     to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The
     phone rings and she runs for it.

                         ALEX
                    (excited, then
                     disappointed)
               Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he
               hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I
               will, doctor, but I just feel
               so helpless sitting here doing
               nothing.  Thank you, yes,
               goodbye.

     She hangs up and looks around the empty flat.  She is
     now more worried than ever.

67   EXT. LONDON ZOO - DAY

     David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if
     the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the
     bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

     Dumbfounded.

     CLOSEUP - A GORILLA EATING

     A LITTLE BOY with four helium balloons on a string is
     staring intently at the gorilla.  The Little Boy leaves
     the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at
     several other animals.  Eventually he comes to the Wolf
     cage.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Pssst!

     The Little Boy looks around.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Hey, kid!  Pssst.  Little boy
               with the balloons.

     The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"

     David cannot be seen.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Come over here.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush replies:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               If you come over here, I'll
               give you a pound.

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Two pounds?

     The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons:

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               Listen, two pounds is a lot of
               money.  It's almost five
               dollars.

                         LITTLE BOY
                    (very English)
               I don't know who you are.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               I'm the famous balloon thief.

                         LITTLE BOY
               Why would a thief want to give
               me two pounds?

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (losing patience)
               Come here and I'll show you.

     The Little Boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery,
     but stops a few feet away.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
                    (pleading)
               Come on!

     The Little Boy edges forward.

                         DAVID (O.S.)
               A little closer.

     When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his
     balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.

                         DAVID
               Thank you.

     David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his
     balloons, startling several animal lovers.

68   EXT. PARK - DAY

     An ELDERLY COUPLE sits feeding birds, their coats
     folded nearly over the park bench.  A naked blur darts
     by, grabbing the top coat as it passes, scaring off the
     birds.

               A naked, American man stole my
               balloons.

                         MOTHER
               What?

                         LITTLE BOY
               A naked, American man -- the
               famous balloon thief.

70   EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     The signs they always have on London newsstands
     proclaim "Man or Monster?"  Dr. Hirsch picks up a
     newspaper with its headline, "London Murder Victims
     Found Partially Devoured".

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I'll have one of those, too.

     He pays for the papers.  The second one's headline,
     "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?"

71   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY - BUS STOP

     in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of
     fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the
     bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to
     floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the
     crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and
     the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high
     heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a
     conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David
     clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar
     trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks
     at him oddly.

                         DAVID
                    (cheerfully)
               A lot of weather we've been
               having lately.

     The man studies David carefully.

72   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY

     Alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading.
     There is loud knocking on the door.  Alex rushes to
     open it and David enters quickly, closing the door
     behind him.  He is still wearing the woman's coat.

                         ALEX
               David!  Where on earth have
               you been!?!

                         DAVID
               I'm freezing.

     He goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and
     gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is
     excited, even euphoric.

                         DAVID
               Alex, I've lost my mind.  I
               woke up at the zoo!  But you
               know what?  I feel terrific!

                         ALEX
               The zoo?

                         DAVID
               Waking up at the zoo, that's
               not so insane.  Having no
               clothes on?  That's insane.
               What did I do last night,
               Alex?

                         ALEX
               Don't you remember?

                         DAVID
               I said goodbye to you.  I was
               locked out of the flat.  I
               climbed the wall and came in
               through the bathroom window.
               I started to read and then I
               was naked at the zoo!
                    (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
     shoulders.

                         ALEX
               I worried about you.  We
               didn't know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back
     with equal passion.

                         ALEX
               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE

     Dr. Hirsch is dialing the phone.

74   INT. ALEX'S FLAT

     The phone rings.

                         ALEX
               I'll get it.

     Alex goes to the phone.

                         ALEX
               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and
     Dr. Hirsch.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
                         ALEX
               He's here.

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (excited)
               Is he all right?  Why didn't
               you call me?  Where was he?

                         ALEX
               He doesn't remember.  He woke
               up at the zoo.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               The zoo?  Is he rational?

                         ALEX
               Yes, he is.  He's very excited
               and confused, but he's not
               crazy, if that's what you
               mean.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Have you read the papers
               today?  Have you listened to
               the radio or television?

                         ALEX
               No, why?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Is David acting strangely?

                         ALEX
               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

                         ALEX
               Yes, I should think so.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Right.  Now listen carefully.
               I want you to bring David
               here.  I want him in my care.
               I'll notify the police that
               we've found him.  It is
               imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital.  Do
               you understand?

                         ALEX
               Yes, Doctor.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               You're certain he's lucid?
               You won't need any help?

                         ALEX
               He's fine.  We'll come right
               over.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Shall I send a car?

                         ALEX
               No, a cab will be faster.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
     dials again.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Yes, Scotland Yard?


75   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     Alex and David are walking.

                         ALEX
               The next corner we can get a
               cab.

                         DAVID
                    (grins)
               I should be committed.

                         ALEX
               Dr. Hirsch will know what to
               do.

                         DAVID
                    (stretches)
               I don't know why I feel so
               good.  I haven't felt this
               good in a long time.

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

                         DAVID
               My body feels alive, alert.  I
               feel like an athlete.

     A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.

                         ALEX
               Get in.

76   INT. TAXI - DAY

                         ALEX
               Saint Martin's Hospital.

                         DRIVER
               Right.

     As they drive.

                         DRIVER
               It's like the days of the Mad
               Barber of Fleet Street, isn't
               it?

                         ALEX
               I beg your pardon?

                         DRIVER
               The murders.

                         DAVID
                    (concerned)
               What murders?

                         DRIVER
               Last night.  Haven't you
               heard?  Six people in
               different parts of the city
               mutilated.  A real maniac this
               one.

                         DAVID
               Pull over.

                         ALEX
               But....

                         DAVID
                    (adamant)
               Pull over.

77   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

     The cab pulls to the sidewalk.

                         DAVID
               Pay the man.

     David gets out of the cab.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
     after David.

                         ALEX
               David, what are you doing?

                         DAVID
               Six people mutilated?  It had
               to be me, Alex.

                         ALEX
               David, stop!

     He turns and faces her.

                         DAVID
               I am going to the cops.
               There's a full moon tonight.
               Jack was right.  I....

                         ALEX
                    (angry)
               Jack is dead!

                         DAVID
               Jack is dead.  Look, six
               people have been killed.  I'm
               going to the police.

     David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex
     has to jog to keep up with him.

                         ALEX
               David, please be rational.
               Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.

                         DAVID
               Rational!?!  I'm a fucking
               werewolf, for Christ's sake!

     He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.

                         DAVID
               Officer, I killed those people
               last night.

                         BOBBIE
                    (interested)
               You did, did you?

     Alex runs up.

                         ALEX
               He's playing a stupid joke,
               sir.

                         DAVID
                    (dumbfounded)
               What?

                         ALEX
               We had an argument.  He's
               being silly.

                         DAVID
                    (desperate)
               I swear, I don't know this
               girl.

                         BOBBIE
               All right, you two, move
               along.

                         DAVID
               Hey, you asshole!  I want you
               to arrest me!

                         BOBBIE
               There's no call for that kind
               of language.

                         DAVID
                    (shouts)
               Queen Elizabeth is a man!
               Prince Charles is a faggot!
               Winston Churchill was full of
               shit!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing patience)
               Now see here young man.

                         DAVID
               Shakespeare was French!  The
               Queen Mother sucks cocks in
               hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!

     The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians
     start to gather.

                         BOBBIE
               That's quite enough!

                         ALEX
                    (pleading)
               David, please!

                         DAVID
               Who is this girl?

                         BOBBIE
               You're going to have to stop
               this disturbance or I shall
               arrest you.

                         DAVID
                    (frustrated, yelling)
               That's what I want you to do,
               you moron!

                         ALEX
                    (to Bobbie)
               Sir, he's very upset.  His
               friend was killed and....

                         DAVID
               Will you shut up!?!!

                         BOBBIE
                    (losing his temper)
               That's enough!  Now go about
               your business.

                         ALEX
               Yes, David, let's go.

                         DAVID
                    (disbelief)
               You're not going to arrest me?

     David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.

                         DAVID
               Don't you think he should
               arrest me?
                         ONLOOKER
               Well, I'm not sure.  How does
               he know this isn't a prank?

                         DAVID
                    (despair)
               A prank?

                         ALEX
                    (urgently)
               David....

     The Bobbie has lost all patience.

                         BOBBIE
               I've no time for this
               foolishness.
                    (to onlookers)
               Nothing to look at.  Move
               along.

     The Bobbie walks away.  David is beside himself.

                         DAVID
               Hopeless.  It's hopeless.

                         ALEX
                    (softly)
               David, let's go now.

     David turns in a rage.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone, dammit!  You
               people are crazy!  I've got to
               get away from here!  I've got
               to do something!

                         ALEX
                    (worried)
               David, don't lose control.

                         DAVID
                    (approaching, hysteria)
               Control!?!  What control!?!
               Get away from me!

     He begins to cry.

                         DAVID
               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their
     brakes, just missing him.

                         ALEX
               David, wait!

     It's too late.  He's lost in traffic.  Alex stands for
     a moment not knowing which way to turn.

78   EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     David is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in
     an alley.  He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.

79   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk.
     Dr. Hirsch is talking to Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               The forensic lads seem to feel
               that some sort of animal was
               involved, that's true, but I
               hardly think....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               Regardless of what you think,
               Lieutenant, the fact remains
               that David is missing and that
               we must find him.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Before nightfall.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Precisely.

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (harried)
               Gentlemen, please.  We shall
               find Mr. Kessler as quickly as
               we're able.

                         ALEX
               He tried to have himself
               arrested.  He....

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (interrupts)
               Getting arrested isn't all
               that difficult, Miss Price.

                         ALEX
               He wants help.  He....

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (interrupts)
               What can we do to assist you?

                         LT. VILLIERS
                    (rising)
               Stay here.  If we need you,
               we'll know where to reach you.

     He and Sgt. McManus pause by the door.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               I cannot accept a connection
               between David Kessler and last
               night's murders.  We will find
               him, however.  I can assure
               you of that.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               We'll find him, not to worry.

     The two policemen exit.  Dr. Hirsch looks at Alex.

                         ALEX
                    (distraught)
               What shall we do?

                         DR. HIRSCH
                    (comforting)
               Tea would be nice.

80   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - DAY

     David is in a telephone booth.

                         DAVID
               Yes, operator.  I'd like to
               call the United States and
               reverse the charges.  David
               Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll
               wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code
               315/472-3402.  Thank you.
                    (pause)
               Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,
               you'll accept the charges.
               Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom
               or Dad home?  Where are they?
               Where's Max?  You're all
               alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't
               leave me alone when I was ten.
               No, not ten and a half either.
               I'm still in London.  I'm all
               better.  Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them?
               I don't care, Rachel, just do
               it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,
               Rachel, don't fight with Max.
               Well, try.  Look, kid, please
               don't forget to tell Mom and
               Dad I love them.  I love Max
               and you, too.  Well, I do.
               No, I'm not being weird, you
               little creep.  You promise?
               Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love
               you.  Bye.

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.

81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.

                         TICKET LADY
               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.

                         DAVID
               Will you take a traveler's
               check?

                         TICKET LADY
               No, sorry.

     David signs a $100 check and hands it to her.

                         DAVID
               Keep the change.

                         TICKET LADY
               Well, thank you, sir!

     She gives him a ticket.  David goes in.

82   INT. CINEMA - DAY

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.

                         DAVID
               Hi, Jack.

                         JACK
               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

                         DAVID
               What can I say, Jack?

                         JACK
               You don't have to say
               anything.

                         DAVID
               Aren't you going to say, `I
               told you so'?

                         JACK
               If I was still alive, I
               probably would.

                         DAVID
               You look awful.

                         JACK
               Thank you.

                         DAVID
                    (apologizes quickly)
               I didn't mean it.  I don't
               know what I'm saying.  I'm not
               even sure it was me who killed
               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.

                         JACK
               What about the zoo?

                         DAVID
               Well, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to
               do something like that.  I
               mean, here I sit in Leicester
               Square talking to a corpse.
               I'm glad to see you, Jack.

                         JACK
               I want you to meet some
               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.

                         JACK
               David Kessler, this is Gerald
               Bringsly.

                         DAVID
               Hello.

                         JACK
               Gerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it
               best you didn't see him as
               he's a fresh kill and still
               pretty messy.

                         BRINGSLY
                    (in shadow; very English)
               Yes, I do look most
               unpleasant.

     The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
     the seat to a puddle on the floor.

                         DAVID
                    (horrified)
               Why are you doing this to me,
               Jack?

                         BRINGSLY
               This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
               He is your good friend,
               whereas I am a victim of your
               carnivorous lunar activities.

                         DAVID
                    (appalled)
               Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I
               have absolutely no idea what
               to say to you.

                         BRINGSLY
               You've left my wife a widow
               and my children fatherless.
               And I understand that I am to
               walk the earth one of the
               living dead until the wolf's
               bloodline is severed and the
               curse lifted.

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.

                         BRINGSLY
               You must die, David Kessler.

                         JACK
               David, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.

                         JACK
               And these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All
     are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
     illuminating their gore.

                         DERELICT #2
               Can't say we're pleased to
               meet you, Mr. Kessler.

                         DAVID
                    (defeated)
               What shall I do?

                         JACK
               Suicide.

                         HARRY
                    (adamantly)
               You must take your own life!

                         DAVID
               That's easy for you to say -
               you're already dead.

                         BRINGSLY
               No, David.  Harry and I and
               everyone you murder are not
               dead.  The undead.

                         DAVID
                    (to Jack)
               Why are you doing this to me?

                         JACK
               Because this must be stopped.

                         DAVID
               How shall I do it?

                         JUDITH
               Sleeping pills?

                         DERELICT #1
               Not sure enough.

                         DAVID
               I could hang myself.

                         JACK
               If you did it wrong, it would
               be painful.  You'd choke to
               death.

                         DERELICT #3
               So what?  Let `im choke.

                         JACK
               Do you mind?  The man's a
               friend of mine.

                         DERELICT #3
               Well he ain't no friend of
               mine.

                         BRINGSLY
               Gentlemen, please.

                         HARRY
               A gun.

                         DERELICT #1
               I know where he can get a gun.

                         DAVID
               Don't I need a silver bullet
               or something?

                         JACK
               Be serious, would you?

     David puts his head in his hands.

                         DAVID
               Madness.  I've gone totally
               mad.

                         HARRY
               A gun is good.

                         JUDITH
               You just put the gun to your
               forehead and pull the trigger.

                         BRINGSLY
               If you put it in your mouth,
               then you'd be sure not to
               miss.

                         DAVID
               Thank you, you're all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.


                                                  CUT TO:

83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT

     The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.

84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three
     small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle
     staring at him.

                         DAVID
                    (gasps out in anguish)
               Go away!  Please!  Go away!

     The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow
     more severe.

                         DAVID
                    (his face contorting)
               Run!  Please...run.

     His hands clutch the arms of his chair.  Coarse thick
     hair splits his skin.  The children's eyes widen in
     fascination.

85   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The
     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:
                         TICKET TAKER
               I'll check on the house.

     He goes inside the theater.

86   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!

                                                  CUT TO:

87   EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

     From way up high we look down on the sidewalks and
     single out TWO BOBBIES running furiously to the cinema
     through the busy traffic.

88   EXT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The two cops run up, the Ticket Lady is hysterical.

                         TICKET LADY
               It's horrible, horrible!
               There's a beast!  A mad dog!
               It's killing people in there!

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

90   EXT. CINEMA

     As the cop bolts the door shut.

                         COP #1
               For God's sake, Tom, there's a
               monster in there!
     The doors shudder as the Wolf begins to batter them
     down.  The cops strain to keep them shut.

                         COP #1
               Call for assistance and tell
               them to bring guns.

     Pedestrians start milling around.  The door is bulging.
     The Wolf's roars continue.

                         COP #2
               Keep moving!  Will you people
               get out of the way!

91   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Alex is asleep.  Dr. Hirsch wakes her.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Nurse Hobbs said there's a
               disturbance in Leicester
               Square involving some sort of
               mad dog.

                         ALEX
               David?

                         DR. HIRSCH
               I doubt it.  But it's
               something to do.

92   INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     An officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are
     distributed to uniformed men.

93   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are
     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
     closed against the Wolf's battering.

     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers
     and Sgt. McManus.

                         LT. VILLIERS
               What the hell is going on
               here?

                         COP
               It's some kind of animal, sir.
               We....
     Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the
     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.

94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.

                         ALEX
               David!  It's David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.


95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley.  Alex runs to them.

                         ALEX
               Let me through!

                         COP
               Stand clear, miss!

                         ALEX
               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The
     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the
     police line.

                         DR. HIRSCH
               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

                         ALEX
               David?  Is it you?  Is it
               true, David?

     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.

                         ALEX
               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex
     realizes it will kill her.

                         OFFICER
               Fire!

     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on
     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and
     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.

          We slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on
          the south shore of Long Island. The still shroud of night
          blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning
          hours.

          Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and
          neighbours slumber. We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch
          Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana,
          two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on
          the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the
          top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at
          us.
                         
          A signpost in the front yard reads "HIGH HOPES", a testament
          to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.

          2.INT. BASEMENT ­ 112 OCEAN AVENUE ­ CONTINUOUS
                         
          We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed
          beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we
          reach a bearded man in his early twenties. RONALD DEFEO
          JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on
          a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television
          that displays white static.
                         
          There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the
          sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time
          changes to 3:15am. We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his
           3.
                         
                         
          lips as cold air sweeps through the room. His eyes snap
          open.
          A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the
          shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action
          Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the
          mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A
          voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be
                         INHUMAN:
                         
                          FIGURE
           Kill them. Kill them all.
                         
          Butch stands and takes the rifle. The figure retreats back
          into the shadows.

          The house is silent. Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the
          rifle grasped tightly in his hands.

          4.INT. MASTER BEDROOM ­ CONTINUOUS
                         
          Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents
          as they sleep. RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a
          heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is
          a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.
          Both are lying flat on their stomachs. Without hesitation,
          Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the
          trigger. The BLAST is deafening. The first shot rips into
          his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting
          through his chest. Butch fires another round, again hitting
          his father in the back. This shot pierces the base of Ronald
          Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck.Louise DeFeo's eyes
          open, but she barely has a few seconds to react. Butch aims
          the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and
          fires two shots in quick succession. The bullets shatter her
          rib cage and collapse her right lung. Both bodies now lay
          silently in fresh pools of their own blood.

          Butch, in an almost trance like state, walks down the hall
          and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom.

          Butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers MARK, aged
          twelve, and JOHN, aged nine, share. He walks between their
          two beds as they lie on their stomachs, sleeping soundly.
          Standing directly above his two helpless brothers, Butch
          fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping.
                         
          The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their
          internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of
          them. Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord
          has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches
          spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting.

          Stangely, the loud shots have not roused the remaining
          members of the DeFeo family, and Butch skulks unchallenged
          to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters
          DAWN, eighteen years old, and ALLISON, aged thirteen.

          As Butch enters the room, Allison stirs. She looks up just
          as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger.
          Butch then aims his weapon at Dawn's head and squeezes the
          trigger again, literally blowing the left side of her face
          off. Both girls die instantly. The white sheets and walls
          are splattered with blood and brain matter. Butch is unmoved
          and expressionless. He surveys the carnage for a moment,
          then calmly walks out of the room.

          Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red
          frame. It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a
          group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces. The
          sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around a
          Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes through the house.
          We push in on the photograph and:

          A young girl in her mid twenties is driving the car. She is
          attractive yet she dresses very conservatively in a thick
          sweater and baggy combat trousers. This is LISA TEMPLETON.
          She consults a crumpled piece of paper. Directions are
          scribbled on it.

          Lisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor. She has a
          file in her hand and taps her fingers on it nervously. A
          door opens and a middle aged man dressed in a crisp white
          shirt and tie steps out. He is well groomed and his eyes are
          warm and inviting. This is DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER.

           Lisa Templeton?
                         
          Lisa stands abruptly, dropping her file in the process.

          Lisa manages to retrieve the file and papers from the floor
          and compose herself. Mixter holds the door open and Lisa
          enters the office.

          Mixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk. He
          glances over it.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Very good. I see you've had lots of
           experience cleaning private homes.
                         
                          LISA
           Yes, I uh... I've done a lot of

           Well an institution such as this
           one is a very different
           proposition.
                         
                          LISA
           Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've
           also worked cleaning a school, so I
           am used to big areas.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Yes I've seen that. When I say this
           is a different proposition I mean
           in terms of the sensitivity
           required due to the nature of what
           we do here.
                         
                          LISA
           Oh yes, yes of course.
                         
                          MIXTER
           You would mainly be working night
           shifts at a time when patients are
           on lock down. But many of our
           patients here have psychological
           disturbances so there may be
           situations where you have to clean
           up things you may not be used to
           cleaning up. If you know what I'm
           saying.
                         
                          LISA
           I know what you mean, yes.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Would that bother you?
                         
                          LISA
           It may be strange at first but I
           actually have some experience in

          when she lost control of her bodily
          functions during her illness. It's
          something I got used to very
          quickly. It became routine.
                         
                          MIXTER
          I see. How is your mother now?
                         
                          LISA
          Well... she passed away.
                         
                          MIXTER
          I'm sorry to hear that. So... it's
          important to me that every employee
          here, whether they are a
          psychiatrist, an orderly or a
          cleaner, needs to fully understand
          what our mission statement at this
          hospital is.
                         
                          LISA
          Okay.
                         
                          MIXTER
          High Hopes was only built two years
          ago and as an institution we have
          only been running for just over a
          year now. So we're still building
          our reputation. But I am very clear
          on what I want that reputation to
          be. I intend to make this
          institution one of the foremost
          centres for mental health treatment
          in the country. If you look into my
          history you'll know that I have a
          stellar reputation in the field of
          psychiatry and I want to use that
          to help others. That is why I have
          put my own money into the creation
          of this institution. We are only
          just starting out but we have a
          long term ambition to be considered
          the best. So what I require is that
          every person who works at this
          institution, in any capacity, must
          be professional and sensitive to
          the needs of the patients. Unlike
          other institutions, the welfare and
          care of our patients comes first
          here.

                          LISA
           I really admire that and I promise
           I would not let you down if I was
           given this job.
                         
                          MIXTER
           I'm sure you wouldn't.
                         
          Lisa's face quickly contorts. Mixter looks puzzled. Suddenly
          Lisa sneezes. It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to
          cover her mouth and nose. She sneezes all over Mixter. Lisa
          looks horrified.
                         
                          LISA
           Oh my God, I'm so sorry!!
                         
          Lisa rushes to Mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a
          Kleenex box on his desk. She frantically wipes the saliva
          and snot from his face.
                         
                          MIXTER
           It's quite alright, please sit
           down, I can take care of it.
                         
          Lisa, completely mortified, sits back down. An unimpressed
          Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. When
          he's done he stares at Lisa.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Okay... well thanks for coming in.
           I'll let you know.
                         
                          LISA
           Look I'm so sorry, I really am!
                         
                          MIXTER
           It's fine. We'll be in touch.
                         
          Such is her embarrassment, Lisa can't get out of the office
          fast enough.

          Lisa is lying on her bed watching TV, flicking endlessly
          through the channels. The phone on the bedside table rings.
          Lisa picks up the receiver.

           Hey Nancy.
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
           How did it go today?
                         
                          LISA
           It was a total fucking disaster!
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
           Oh I'm sure you're just being silly
           hun! Whenever I've gone for an
           interview I always come out
           thinking it's gone really badly.
           But I bet it went better than you
           think.
                         
                          LISA
           I sneezed on the head of the
           institution.
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
           You what??
                         
                          LISA
           I sneezed on him! It was one of
           those sneezes that just sneaks up
           on you, I didn't have time to cover
           my face. Before you know it he's
           covered in my snot!
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
           Oh God I'm sorry hun.
                         
          Long silence on the line.
                         
                          LISA
           Go on, go ahead. You know you want
           to!

           Laugh it up, it's gonna be your
           last chance because I'm not going
           for any more job interviews! I'm
           done, I'm always so damn nervous
           and I just don't make a good first
           impression.
           11.
                         
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
          You should take my advice and show
          a little cleavage at these
          interviews! Trust me, you'd get the
          job then!
                         
                          LISA
          That's just not me Nance. I
          wouldn't know where to start with
          flirting or any of that. Christ, if
          I wore high heels to one of these
          interviews I'd probably trip over!
          I'm a clumsy dork!
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
          So what are you thinking of doing?
                         
                          LISA
          I dunno. Thanks for not disputing
          that dork remark by the way.

          I guess I'll have to sign on
          welfare to make the rent. Long
          term, maybe I should go back to
          school. Get better qualified for
          something.
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
          How come you don't do something
          with your writing? You could try
          and get something published. Or
          write a book or something?
                         
                          LISA
          I dunno, I just... it's like I just
          haven't been able to bring myself
          to write since ... you know...
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
          I know. It's a cliché, but time
          really is a healer. I'm sure the
          passion you had for it will come
          back.
                         
                          LISA
          Maybe.
                         
           NANCY (O.S)

           Not really. I just think I'm gonna
           get myself a nice big tub of ice
           cream from the freezer and watch
           some TV.
                         
           NANCY (O.S)
           Comfort eating!

           a good time for ice cream it's
           today!
                         
           NANCY (O.S)

           call tomorrow, let's go for coffee
           soon yeah?

          pulls out a tub and tosses it on the counter. She opens the

          Lisa enters the hospital. A man in his thirties dressed in a
          boiler suit is stood on a step ladder. He is attempting to
          change a light bulb in the hallway but seems to be making
          hard work of it. The bulb drops from his hand and smashes to
          the ground. Lisa looks up at him.

           We work nights so today we'll just
           show you around, okay?
                         
                          LISA
           Okay, thank you.
                         
                          DELANEY
           I'll clean this up and we'll get to
           it.

          19.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD ­ LATER
          Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa
          are silhouetted in the doorway. Delaney pulls a string
          hanging near the door and a light comes on. The cupboard is
          packed with various cleaning products.
                          DELANEY
           This is the storage cupboard.
           Everything you will need for each
           15.
                         
                         
          task is here, each shelf is
          labelled.
                         
                          LISA
          Okay.
                         
                          DELANEY
          The most obvious task is hoovering.
          This is our hoover here, it's
          straight forward. You'll be
          surprised that although it's
          powerful it's very quiet, because
          we are working when everyone's in
          bed so obviously we don't want to
          wake them up! It has a Telescopic
          suction tube and six stage filter
          system. So a lot more powerful than
          you may be used to.
                         
                          LISA
          Okay.
                         
                          DELANEY
          The mop and bucket is here, we
          usually use standard bleach to mix
          with the water so that's straight
          forward. But there is this
          specialist stain remover that you
          must use if there are any stains on
          the floor or carpet. It needs to be
          sprayed and left to set for twenty
          minutes before scrubbing or
          mopping. It's a special formula for
          tea, coffee, water marks and other
          yellow and brown discolourations on
          the carpets or floors. It's pretty
          strong so wash your hands after you
          use it!
                         
                          LISA
                         OKAY
                         
                          DELANEY
          One of the worst parts of the job
          is we have to remove chewing gum
          from lots of surfaces. They don't
          just stick it underneath the
          tables, it ends up everywhere!
                         
                          LISA
          Gross!
                          16
                         
                         
                          DELANEY
           Yes! I think a lot of the time it's
           the staff doing it, not the
           patients! But we have this GumCart,
           which is a bit complicated but it's
           easier than just scraping the gum.
           The steam is super heated to one
           hundred eighty degrees and
           delivered at seven point zero bar
           pressure. It can produce a hundred
           and fifteen litres of superheated
           steam per minute.
                         
                          LISA
           Is it okay if I watch you use it a
           few times first so I know exactly
           what I'm doing? I don't want to end
           up burning myself or any furniture!
                         
          Delaney smiles.
                         
                          DELANEY
           No problem. Now here we come to the
           most dangerous chemical we have.
           This is a concrete cleaner, very
           toxic stuff, so you have to wear
           the face mask and gloves we have
           here, okay?
                         
                          LISA
           Okay.
                         
                          DELANEY
           This is for cleaning and descaling
           brick, stone and concrete and for
           metal de-rusting. For concrete you
           must mix it one part to four parts
           water. Brush or spray it on with
           the equipment here then leave it
           five to ten minutes to set, then
           rinse it off. But for those
           stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use
           it neat!
                         
                          LISA
           Okay.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Don't worry if anything seems
           complicated, you'll get used to it.
           But you'll mostly be mopping and
           hoovering in your first few weeks.
           17.

          20.INT. WARD B ­ LATER
                         
          Lisa follows Delaney into the communal area of Ward B. The
          walls are white and clinical. Various patients are scattered
          across the room, each with a look of resignation in their
          eyes. Many stare blankly out of the window.
                         
                          DELANEY
           This is Ward B, one of two wards
           you'll be responsible for cleaning
           each evening. Essentially the main
           duties will be emptying the bins,
           hoovering the carpeted areas and
           mopping the hallways. The patients
           in here are Category B. They're
           mainly people who have had nervous
           breakdowns and those who are
           catatonic. They're harmless. Like
           Missus Hardesty here.
                         
          Delaney and Lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still
          in the chair. Her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Hello Missus Hardesty.
                         
          No response or acknowledgement of other people's presence.
                         
                          DELANEY
           She hasn't spoken a word in all her
           time here. The orderlies just lift
           her from the bedroom to the day
           room and back again every day.
                         
                          LISA
           Why did you just talk to her?
                         
                          DELANEY
           We've still got to treat them like
           human beings. Otherwise they just
           become like furniture and we all
           lose our humanity. I like to think
           she can hear me, even if she won't
           talk to me. See you later Missus
           Hardesty.
                          18
                         
                         
                         
          Missus Hardesty continues to stare into nothingness. Delaney
          and Lisa exit.

          Delaney and Lisa stroll down the long corridors.
                         
                          DELANEY
           The patients are locked in their
           rooms on our night shift, but now
           and again they might have an
           accident we gotta clean up.
                         
                          LISA
           Okay.
                         
                          DELANEY
           In the day time there are nurses
           who often clean up but in the night
           we may be called to provide fresh
           linen or mop up. Not the most
           pleasant of jobs but it happens
           from time to time.
                         
                          LISA
           Yeah I understand.
                         
          Delaney and Lisa arrive at a doorway.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Now here we come to the most
           difficult part of the job.
                         
                          LISA
           Cleaning crap up isn't the most
           difficult part?!
                         
          Delaney smiles.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Oh no, that's very easy compared to
           what's behind this door.
                         
                          LISA
           What's behind it?
                         
                          DELANEY
           This leads down to Ward X.
           19.
                         
                         
                          LISA
           Sounds ominous.
                         
                          DELANEY
           You could say that. It's where
           Category A patients are held. The
           criminally insane.
                         
                          LISA
           Really? Doctor Mixter didn't
           mention that.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Yes, well, these patients are
           beyond help so they've become athe
           hospital's secret. Many of them
           were transferred from prisons and
           other institutions. Doctor Mixter
           probably thought he could help
           them. He can't. The staff call this
           place Blood Row.
                         
          Delaney opens the door.

          Lisa follows Delaney down a winding staircase. As they
          descend down the steps, the light fades.

          Delaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of
          thick metal doors either side. Two light bulbs hang from the
          ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal
          illumination. Lisa's nose twitches.
                         
                          LISA
           What's that smell?
                         
                          DELANEY
           It always hangs in the air. No
           matter how much we bleach the floor
           there is always that smell of
           death.
                          20
                         
                         
          Lisa looks concerned.
                         
                          LISA
           These patients are dangerous?
                         
                          DELANEY
           Yes. But don't worry, we never have
           to interact directly or anything
           like that. You will just be mopping
           the corridor and dusting.
                         
          Delaney walks over to the first door on the right. There is
          a hatch on the door. Delaney slowly slides it open and
          beckons Lisa over. She peers inside. The cell is very basic,
          white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable
          looking bed and a toilet without a seat. There are thick
          iron bars on one small window. A skinny man in his thirties
          sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth.
          He has wild hair and a scraggly beard.
                         
                          DELANEY
           That's Jerry Kimble. He was
           convicted of stabbing a young
           mother forty-nine times in front of
           her two year-old son, then killing
           and sexually assaulting a woman
           before smothering her four-year-old
           daughter. They call him the Green
           Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing
           but was certified insane and his
           lawyer got him transferred here. He
           doesn't make any noise or fuss, but
           he is a dangerous man. Especially
           towards women. This next inmate is
           even worse.
          Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next
          door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.
          Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man
          stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his
          back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes
          that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch
          shut.
                          DELANEY
           That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as
           The Long Island Cannibal. He was
           abused as a child so his targets
           were always paedophiles and
           rapists. He'd track them down and
           torture them. He would eat parts of
           their body while they were still
           alive.
           21.
                         
                         
                          LISA
           That's horrible.
                         
                          DELANEY
           The most horrible thing is that a
           lot of the public thought he was a
           hero.
                         
          Delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the
          hallway. He slides open the hatch.

           Sadie Krenwinkel.
                         
          Lisa looks inside. Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross
          legged on her bed. She has long flowing black hair, intense
          eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. She looks up
          and smiles at Lisa. Delaney slides the hatch shut.
                         
                          LISA
           What's her deal?
                         
                          DELANEY
           She was a member of a Witchcraft
           cult. They kidnapped six people for
           a demonic ritual. Five were killed
           but one got away and led police to
           the cult. She turned her trial into
           a circus, talking about lots of
           crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it
           but she got certified insane by the
           court. She's been around a few
           institutions since. Now she's here.
                         
                          LISA
           Some strange stories here.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Well those aren't the strangest.
                         
                          LISA
           Really?
                          DELANEY
           This last patient is the strangest
           case.
          Delaney walks over to the last door on the left. He slides
          open the hatch. A singular shaft of light coming from a tiny
          barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell.
          Lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows.
                          DELANEY
           This is our resident John Doe.
           Sometimes we have people with
                          22
                         
                         
           amnesia. Often we find out who they
           are. Not so with this man.
                         
                          LISA
           Why is he down here?
                         
                          DELANEY
           They first brought him in about six
           months ago. No one knows where he
           came from, he literally just turned
           up late one night. An orderly found
           him wandering the grounds. First of
           all he was like Missus Hardesty
           upstairs-catatonic. Then a few
           weeks later he started to respond
           to Doctor Mixter and the nurses
           through facial expressions and
           gestures. But soon, he got violent.
           Very violent. He'd have bursts of
           rage and beat other patients. One
           day he appeared to have a seizure
           and collapsed. A young doctor tried
           to take his vital signs. Patient X
           here throttled him so hard he
           crushed his larynx. It took six
           orderlies to restrain him. Now they
           won't even let him out for the
           obligatory hour a day exercise. We
           still don't know who he is.
                         
                          LISA
           Oh God.
                         
          Delaney stares at Lisa.
                         
                          DELANEY
           God has nothing to do with this
           man.
          Delaney slams the hatch shut. Lisa looks disturbed.
                         
                          DELANEY
           I haven't put you off have I?
                         
                          LISA
           I guess not... it's just a lot to
           take in. I've obviously never been
           around stuff like this before.
                         
                          DELANEY
           This is the reality of this place.
           We don't deal with these people
           directly but we may have to clean
           up their mess. If you can't handle
           23.
                         
                         
           that then I understand. You know
           that it's not too late to back out?
                         
          Lisa considers for a moment.
                         
                          LISA
           I'm not a quitter.

          Lisa hoovers the carpet in the empty communal room. She then
          empties the bins. A Clock on the wall ticks towards 3:15am.

          26.INT. HALLWAY ­ A LITTLE LATER
                         
          Lisa is mopping. As she reaches the end of the hallway a
          young girl walks around the corner carrying a teddy bear.
          Lisa is STARTLED.
                          LISA
           Ooh, you made me jump! Should you
           be out of bed this late?
                         
                          GIRL
           I don't know.
                         
          The girl has flowing blonde hair and an angelic face, yet
          there is a haunting sadness in her eyes.
                         
                          LISA
           I don't think you should be.
                         
                          GIRL
           Do you want to play with me?
                         
                          LISA
           I'd love to sweetheart, but it's
           very late now. I think you better
           go back to bed.

                          GIRL
           Okay.
                         
                         
          The girl walks away.

          Lisa is returning the mop and bucket to the storage
          cupboard. She knocks a bottle off the shelf and leans over
          to pick it up.
                         
          POV SHOT: Someone is approaching Lisa, edging closer and
          closer. A hand stretches out and touches her shoulder. Lisa
          JUMPS and SMACKS her head on the underside of the bottom
          shelf.
                         
                          LISA
           Fuck!!
                         
          Lisa turns around to see Delaney standing there.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Sorry, I didn't mean to startle
           you.
                         
                          LISA
           It's okay.
                         
          Lisa rubs her head.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          LISA
           Yeah, just hurt that's all!
                         
                          DELANEY
           Sorry.

           Do you want to grab a coffee?

           Sure.

          Delaney and Lisa are sat on a bench in the hallway sipping
          coffee from plastic cups.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Did you change the bins in the Day
           Room?
                         
                          LISA
           Yeah.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Good. I've got a light bulb to
           change in Room Twelve upstairs
           soon. We're making good time.
                         
                          LISA
           Cool. It's funny, I never thought
           I'd get this job. The interview
           didn't go well!
                         
                          DELANEY
           Doctor Mixter told me you were the
           only person he interviewed for the
           job.
                         
                          LISA
           Really?
                         
                          DELANEY
           Yeah. I'm sure he felt you were
           right for the job and didn't need
           to interview anyone else.
                         
                          LISA
           Cool.
                         
          Lisa looks down at a distinctive tattoo on Delaney's wrist.
                         
                          LISA
           Nice tattoo.
                         
                         
          Delaney pulls his sleeve down to cover it up.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Oh yeah. I forget I have it
           sometimes.

           What does it mean?
                         
                          DELANEY
           Well... it represents a lot of
           wrong turns in my younger years.
                         
                          LISA
           Like what?
                         
          Delaney doesn't answer and takes a long sip of coffee.
                         
                          LISA
           Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
                         
                          DELANEY
           It's okay. Let's just say the past
           is better left there.
                         
                          LISA
           Fair enough.
                         
                          DELANEY
           So how is the first night going for
           you?
                         
                          LISA
           Not bad. I ran into a young girl in
           the hallway earlier. Sweet little
           girl, she was only about twelve or
           thirteen. I told her to go back to
           bed. I guess they don't lock the
           kids in at night huh?
                         
          Delaney appears confused.
                         
                          DELANEY
           You sure it was a young girl of
           that age?
                         
                          LISA
           Yeah definitely. She was carrying a
           teddy bear. She was about thirteen
           at the most.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Umm... okay.
                         
                          LISA
           What?
                         
                          DELANEY
           Well... there are no children of
           that age here.
           27.
                         
                         
          Now it's Lisa who is confused.
                         
                          LISA
           What?
                         
                          DELANEY
           In fact, there are no children of
           any age in this place. I think our
           youngest patient is about twenty.
                         
                          LISA
           You're kidding right?
                         
                          DELANEY
           No, I'm serious.
                         
                          LISA
           Then who was that girl in the
           hallway?
                         
                         
          Delaney contemplates for a moment.

           I'm positive.

           I better tell the orderlies. This
           is no place for a little girl to
           be.

          Lisa is polishing a table. Delaney walks in with
          HARDCASTLE,a well built man with a skinhead and visible
          tattoos on his arms.
                          LISA
           Did you find her?
                         
                          DELANEY
           No.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           So you're the one who saw the
           little girl huh?

           Of course.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Well I've had to pull staff off
           other wards to search this goddamn
           place top to bottom. We found
           nothing.
                         
                          LISA
           That's strange.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           A big fucking inconvenience is what
           it is! Do me a favour, the next
           time you think you see something be
           absolutely sure before you go
           running to Jumpsuit here! I ain't
           got time to be running around this
           place looking for shit that isn't
           there! You understand??

           Yes.
                         
          Hardcastle exits. Lisa looks embarrassed.

          Lisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and
          bucket. A clock on the wall reads 3:15am.

          Lisa walks into Ward X. She looks down the dimly lit hallway
          and pauses for a moment. Overcoming her nerves, she places
          the bucket on the floor and starts mopping.
                         
          As she edges through the hallway Lisa notices a light
          flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. She walks
          over and slowly reaches for the hatch. Sliding it open Lisa
          peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle,
          a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six
          lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the
          cell.
                         
          Suddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa
          FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She
          stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch
          shut and rushes towards the exit.

          Delaney is sifting through a tool box. Lisa stands in the
          doorway.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Hey, can you do me a favour?

           What?
                         
                          DELANEY
           Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor
           Mixter's office? I've got to check
           the boiler, there's been complaints
           about the heating not working.
                         
                          LISA
           No problem.
                         
                         
          Lisa grabs a roll of bin bags from the shelf.

          She knocks again. No answer. Lisa tentatively turns the
          handle. The door slowly creaks open. The office is empty.
          Lisa walks in.

          She looks around for the bin, finally locating it by the
          side of the desk. Lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up
          before replacing it with a new bag. With her task complete,
          Lisa's curiosity gets the better of her. She looks around
          the office. There is a shelf full of psychology books and a
          filing cabinet. Lisa touches the top drawer of the filing
          cabinet and it opens.
                         
          Lisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one
          marked 'Patient X'. She reaches for it and suddenly a HAND
          grabs her shoulder! A startled Lisa turns around. An orderly
          in his thirties is stood in front of her. He is thin but
          muscular, with slicked back hair. This is PEMBERTON.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           What the hell are you doing in

           Mixter keeping the garbage in the
           filing cabinet.
                         
                          LISA

           I dunno.
                         
                          PEMBERTON

           to report this kind of thing.
                         
                          LISA
           But I've only just got this job and
           I really need it.
                         
          Pemberton looks her up and down.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           Perhaps we can come to some
           arrangement.

           Well, I'd be doing you a big favour
           if I kept this to myself. So
           perhaps you can do me a favour.
                         
                          LISA
           What kind of favour?
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           A blow job.
                         
          Lisa's face contorts with disgust.
                         
                          LISA

          way.

                          LISA
           Look, you better get out of my way
           or I'm going to report you for
           sexual harassment.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           You've been working here for five
           minutes. You really think Doctor
           Mixter is gonna believe a fucking
           cleaner over a medical
           professional?

          A grateful Lisa brushes past Pemberton and exits the room.

           of-a-bitch Hardcastle. They like to
           throw their weight around. You'll

           You're going to die in here.
                         
          Lisa stops in her tracks. She slowly turns to face Mrs
          Hardesty, who stares blankly into space.
                         
                          LISA
           What did you say?
                         
          Lisa stares at her but there is no response.
                         
                          LISA

          Lisa walks down the hallway. At the other end of the
          corridor HARDCASTLE and PEMBERTON are leaning against the
          wall having a conversation. Lisa approaches them.
                         
                          LISA
           Hi.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           Well look who it is, Miss Sexual
           Harassment.
                         
                          LISA

          Hardcastle laughs.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           What are you laughing at?
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           This one's got a big mouth! First
           ordering a search of the hospital
           for a little girl, now she's
           busting your balls!

           Look, I don't want any trouble. I
           just came to tell you there's a
           patient whose out of their room in
           Ward B.

           useless bag of bones.

          Hardcastle walks down the hallways with Lisa. He looks back
          at Pemberton with a shit eating grin.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE

          Lisa and Hardcastle walk into the day room. The room is
          empty.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Where is this patient huh?
                         
                          LISA
           She was right there, in that chair.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE

                          LISA
           Yeah. She even spoke to me!
                         
          Hardcastle bursts out laughing.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Missus Hardesty was here and she
           spoke to you?
                         
                          LISA
           Yes!

           Just a second...
                         
          Hardcastle steps out into the hallway. A few moments later
          Hardcastle re-enters the day room with Pemberton.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           The new girl here says that Missus
           Hardesty was just sat in that
           chair. Says she even spoke to her.
                         
          Pemberton chuckles.
                         
                          LISA
           Look I know she's supposed to be

           get on with the cleaning and stay
           off the crack pipe. Okay, honey

          Pemberton and Hardcastle both laugh and leave the room.

          Lisa is sweeping in the hallway. She looks up and just
          catches a glimpse of someone turn the corner up ahead.
                         
                          LISA
           Hello?
                         
          Lisa looks around. The hallway is empty. She walks forward
          and turns the corner just in time to see the young girl,
          carrying a teddy bear, push open the door. She enters the
          staircase that leads down to Ward X.
                         
                          LISA

          Lisa drops her brush and rushes forward. She throws open the
          door.

          Lisa rushes down the stairs after her.

          Lisa pushes open the door to Ward X. She peers down the dark
          hallway. The girl is nowhere to be seen.
                         
                          LISA
           Little girl?
          Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors.
          She can hear whispering. Lisa is drawn to the last door on
          the left. She approaches with caution. Stood in front of the
          door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside. John
          Doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow. Lisa peers down
          and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single
          shaft of light from the small window, is a TEDDY BEAR. Lisa
          slides the hatch shut and walks backwards. She is seriously
          unnerved. As she steps back from the door she hears a
          whispering from Kimble's cell. She edges closer to his cell
          door and listens.
           KIMBLE (O.S)
           Palmer... Hey Palmer...
                         
          Palmer can be heard from the next cell. His voice is calm,
          in stark comparison to Kimble's which sounds extremely
          agitated.
                         
           PALMER (O.S)
           Yes?
                         
           KIMBLE (O.S)
           My cock is so hard Palmer. It's so
           hard that I can't contain it any
           more. I'm going to break through
           this wall and do bad things to you.
           Very, very bad.
                         
           PALMER (O.S)
           I must advise you Mister Kimble-
           threats will not be well received.
                         
           KIMBLE (O.S)
           I'm touching myself Palmer. You
           wanna watch? You fucking faggot!
                          38
                         
                         
           PALMER (O.S)
           Stay out of my psyche Mister Kimble
           and I'll stay out of yours.
                         
          Kimble starts to chuckle. Then he stops suddenly. Lisa leans
          closer to the cell door and she hears Kimble sniffing. THUD!
          Lisa jumps back as Kimble kicks the cell door.
                         
           KIMBLE (O.S)
           I know you're out there girlie. I
           can smell your pussy. How about you
           join me in here. Come on!
                         
          Kimble bangs the door continuously. The racket echoes
          through the corridor. Sadie soon joins in, her and Kimble
          laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors. A horrified
          Lisa rushes towards the exit.

          An exhausted Lisa changes out of her work clothes and into a
          large t-shirt. The morning sun bursts through the window,
          filling the room with an orange hue. Lisa shuts the curtains
          and slides under the duvet cover into the welcome sanctuary
          of her bed. Lisa drifts to sleep.

          Lisa is sleeping fast as night falls outside. All we can
          hear is the rhythm of her breathing and the gentle ticking
          of the clock by her bedside table.
                         
          Suddenly her EYES snap open. We pull back and see that Lisa
          is now stood in front of LARGE WOODEN DOORS. The doors open
          and she steps inside.
                         
          45.INT. CHURCH ­ NIGHT
                         
          Lisa enters a Church full of powerful religious imagery. On
          the right side of the entrance she notices a Font. A drop of
          blood pierces the blessed water. As Lisa walks down the
          aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and
          she is moving in slow motion. White feathers cover the
          aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. An open Bible rests on
          the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong
          breeze blowing them. Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the
           39.
                         
                         
          wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares
          at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down
          Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a
          female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer. The
          figure turns. It's LISA'S MOTHER.
                          LISA'S MOTHER
           Don't you grieve for me?
                         
                          LISA
           Of course I do.
          Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks.
          Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out
          to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it
          seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand.
          Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She
          turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness,
          standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church:
                         
                          FIGURE
           Kill them. Kill them all.

          Lisa's eyes OPEN and she sits bolt upright. She is pale and
          soaked with sweat. It takes her a few moments to compose
          herself and realise that it was just a nightmare.

           A little.
                         
                          DELANEY
           That's normal, it frightens me
           sometimes. But I've got to go up to
           a patient's room in Ward A.
           Apparently they've had a little
           accident. Surely you wouldn't
           prefer to clean that up?

           you'll get used to it.
                         
                          LISA
           I can hear them talking. It's kinda
           unnerving.
                         
                          DELANEY
           I know, I hear that too when I'm
           down there. But trust me, once you
           get used to it things will get
           easier.

          The door creaks open. Lisa looks nervous. She walks in with
          her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor. She
          begins mopping the floor. As she mops past Sadie's cell she
          hears a knock on the inside of the cell door.
                         
                          SADIE
           I can hear you out there.

          Lisa is creeped out but she makes an effort to ignore it.
          She continues to mop the floor and starts moving past
          Sadie's cell.
                         
                          SADIE
           I've been talking to your mother
           Lisa.
                         
          Lisa stops dead in her tracks. She looks back at the cell
          door.
                         
                          SADIE
           She's here with me Lisa. She's told
           me all about you.
                         
          Lisa walks over to the cell door.
                         
                          SADIE
           I know you're out there Lisa. Talk
           to me.
                         
                          LISA
           What... what do you expect me to
           say?
                         
                          SADIE
           Perhaps you can tell me all about
           the summer trips to Key West with
           your mother? Those were your
           favourite memories of your mother
           weren't they? Or perhaps you'd
           prefer to tell me about when you
           sat at your mother's bed side for
           six months, watching on helplessly
           as the cancer ravaged her body and
           sucked the life out of her?
                         
          Lisa is horrified. She is shaking.
                         
                          LISA
           How... how do you know all this?
                         
                          SADIE

           me from the flames of hell!

                          SADIE
           She has a message for you Lisa.
           Want to hear it?

          Lisa wipes away the tears and tries to compose herself.
                         
                          SADIE

           What is it?
                         
          There is a pause for a moment before an unnaturally deep
          inhuman voice emerges from Sadie's throat on the other side
          of the cell door:
                         
                          SADIE
           GET OUT!!
          A distraught Lisa rushes towards the exit.

          Lisa rushes into the bathroom. A wave of emotion rises to
          the surface and she sobs into her hands. After a few moments
          the tears subside and she takes a deep inhalation of breath,
          desperately trying to compose herself. Lisa walks over to
          one of the sinks. She looks at her tear stained face in the
          mirror above it. Lisa turns the tap on and water rushes out.
          She leans down and splashes the water on her face.
          Lisa looks up and is STARTLED to see her face reflected in
          the mirror as an OLD HAG! Lisa clutches her decrepit face in
          horror! She closes her eyes and opens them again. Her
          reflection has returned to normal. Lisa hears Sadie's
          maniacal chuckle echo around the bathroom. She rushes out.

          Delaney puts his hand on Lisa's shoulder in a comforting
          manner.

          Continual thumping on one of the cell doors echoes around
          Ward X. Pemberton enters and walks over to Palmer' cell. He
          slides open the hatch.
                         
                          PEMBERTON

           Sorry to bother you Mister

           would be possible to get some
           medical attention?
                         
          Palmer holds up his arm and it's been slashed open. Blood
          pours from the wound.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           Now how the hell did that happen?
                         
          Palmer holds up a makeshift knife.
                         
                          PALMER
           I believe it was this rather crude
           weapon that did the damage.

           Jesus Christ Palmer! Now put the
           weapon on the floor and back away.
                         
          Palmer obliges with a smile on his face. Pemberton unhooks a
          truncheon from his waist belt.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           Put your hands on your fucking head
           and face the wall! Now!!
          Palmer willingly follows the instructions. Pemberton takes a
          set of keys from his belt and unlocks the cell.
                          PEMBERTON

          A nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a
          pair of handcuffs. Palmer slowly starts to back into him.
                         
                          PEMBERTON
           I said don't fucking move!
                         
          Palmer moves faster. Pemberton swings for him but Palmer
          ducks it and spins around, pushing Pemberton into the wall
          knocking him to the floor. Palmer aims a swift and savage
          stamp at Pemberton's head. His skull crushes against the
          cold hard floor. Blood spatters all over the white cell.

          Hardcastle strolls down the hallway.

          57.INT. STAIRCASE ­ CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hardcastle looks down to the base of the staircase.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Pemberton? Pemberton, what's taking
           you so long man??
          No response. Hardcastle rushes down the steps.
                         
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          58.INT. WARD X ­ CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hardcastle enters. He sees the door of Palmer' cell open and
          slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance.
          Hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches
          Palmer' cell. Looking inside he sees Pemberton crumpled on
          the floor in a pool of his own blood.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Shit!
                         
          A SCREAM emerges from the next cell. Hardcastle rushes over
          to Kimble's cell door. Five orderlies rush onto the Ward.
                          HARDCASTLE
           We got a major code six over here!
          The orderlies rush to Hardcastle's side, truncheons at the
          ready. Hardcastle puts a key in the lock and prepares to
          open Kimble's cell.
           47.
                         
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Stay alert!
                         
          Hardcastle turns the key and kicks open the door. They are
          met by the sight of KIMBLE's corpse positioned upright on
          the toilet. There is a hole in his head with part of his
          BRAIN seeping out. Palmer stands next to him, with blood on
          his lips and a plastic spoon in his hand. He smiles, blood
          covering his teeth.
                         
                          PALMER
           Good evening gentleman. I believe
           we will be one short at roll call
           tomorrow morning.
          Hardcastle and the orderlies charge Palmer. He doesn't
          resist as they viscously tackle him to the ground.

          Lisa is walking down the hallway. She hears a SCREAM emerge
          from one of the rooms. She puts her ear to the door and
          hears the SCREAM again. Lisa kneels down and peers through
          the keyhole. In a clinical white room Palmer is strapped
          down on a table. His face is severely cut and bruised but he
          is conscious. Four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a
          fifth smears conductor on Palmer temples.
                         
                          ORDERLY #1
           Do we need to put the bit in his
           mouth?
                         
                          ORDERLY #2
           No. We're not giving him the
           methohexital either.
                         
          The orderly places electrodes either side of Palmer' head.
          He then turns the dial on the ECT device up to full power.
          Palmer SCREAMS as he violently convulses, salivating heavily
          from his mouth. Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he
          bites his own tongue off. Lisa is horrified as she watches
          the orderlies laugh as Palmer experiences a severe seizure.
                         
          POV Shot: Someone is approaching Lisa as she crouches in
          front of the door. A hand reaches out and GRABS her by the
          hair,YANKING her to her feet. Lisa SCREAMS. She turns to see
          Hardcastle standing in front of her. He invades her personal
          space in an intimidating manner.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE

           I just heard something so I ... I was

           What are you seeing in there?
                         
                          LISA
           Oh nothing, I didn't see anything.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           You make sure it stays that way.
           That guy is a fucking menace and he
           deserves everything he gets. So you
           don't talk to Mixter or anyone else
           about anything you've seen in
           there. You understand?
                         
                          LISA
           I won't say anything.
                         
                          HARDCASTLE
           Good. Now don't you got some

           Of course.
                         
          Lisa walks down the hallway. Hardcastle's eyes burn into the
          back of her head.

          shop and there's an attractive young blonde girl waving at
          her. NANCY. Lisa rushes to the table.

          A lot of things. The way they run
          things for starters, the orderlies
          are complete bastards.

          It was a famous house. Or should I
          say infamous. Some guy shot his
          whole family there back in the
          seventies. Parents, brothers,
          sisters. Wiped out his entire
          family with a shotgun. Then the
          next owners of the house only
          lasted there about a month. They
          said they were driven from the
          house by evil spirits. The house
          became known around the world.
          That's why the recent owners sold
          the land, they had enough of all
          the media interest and constant
          tourists. Have you seriously never
          heard of the Amityville horror
          house?

          I vaguely remember hearing some

          really took it in. I honestly
          didn't realise that the hospital
          was on the same land.
                         
                          NANCY
          Yup, right on the spot where the
          house was demolished. You really
          think the place is haunted?
                         
                          LISA

                          NANCY
          Well you're not crazy, hun. Perhaps
          the stories about hauntings at the
          house were true. Maybe the house is
          gone but the spirits stuck around.

           seen too much to be able to just
           walk away and forget the place.

          Ronald Senior stands there, axe in hand, eye-balling his

          Butch storms back towards the house. Ronald Senior brings
          the axe forcefully down on a piece of wood, splitting it
          cleanly in half.

          way holding a brown paper bag.

          Butch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin. On his
          right arm is a belt. He then loads the heroin into a
          syringe. Butch tightens the belt and taps his arm. He sinks
          the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into
          his blood stream. His eyes sink and he lies back onto the
          crusty carpet of the apartment, staring up at the ceiling.
          From a bird's eye view we slowly move down towards Butch.
          Suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears.

          Butch swipes the hand away and spins around to see his

          dig into her husband's neck and draw blood. An enraged
          Ronald Senior grabs his wife's arms as she starts to slap
          him. Butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the
          hallway. Ronald Senior remonstrates with Louise who is still
          trying to slap him.

          eyes bloodshot and his face emotionless, aiming a MARLIN

          There's not much history. We've
          only been open a couple of years.

          No, I mean the history of the land.

          Well I don't know that it was
          haunted. Lots of people think
          that's lies. I know about the kid

          Serious questions tonight.
                         
                          LISA
          I'm just curious.
                         
                          DELANEY
          Why do you ask?
                         
                          LISA
          It's something I've been thinking
          about. How can evil exist in a
           61.
                         
                         
           world that many people believe was
           created by a loving God?
                         
                          DELANEY
           I don't believe that God is a
           bearded man who lives in the sky.
           Or that the Devil is a red demon
           with horns. I believe God and Satan
           are within all of us. God is our
           human side. Satan is our animal
           side. Whether we become good or
           evil depends which side of us we
           feed.
                         
                          LISA
           It's a frightening thing to believe
           that if God exists he is not
           powerful enough to stop evil.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Free will in the hands of a person
           who feeds the Evil inside them.
           That's what frightens me.

           Doctor Mixter must have known what
           stood on this land before the
           hospital.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Of course he did. He bought the
           land and organised the demolition
           of the house himself.

           He's not superstitious. He's a
           doctor, they don't usually believe
           in those things. Amityville is full
           of local legends, going back even
           before the DeFeos.

                          DELANEY
           There's stories about the Native
           Americans being slaughtered on this
           land many years ago. Some people
                          62

           possessed that kid who killed his
           family.
                         
                          LISA

                          DELANEY
           I don't think that's true. If I've
           learnt anything from the patients
           on Ward X, it's that some people
           have a mind that works in a
           different way to other people.
           Those people who do bad things have
           fed the evil within them more than
           the good. It's not possession, it's
           sickness. Sickness of the soul.
                         
                          LISA
           I don't know what to think.
                         
                          DELANEY
           Just don't let your imagination run
           away with you Lisa. You're a person
           who feeds that good within you.
           Don't let this place feed the evil.

                          GLORIA
           Ah yes, here it is. (Reading) In
           the 18th Century there existed a
           group of Native Americans in
           Amityville known as "The Satchem
           Tribe" led by Satchem Takapausha,
           the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem
           in Massachusetts to escape
           persecution by the Christians who
           were persecuting members of the
           tribe because of their Witchcraft
           practices. These practices included
           a ritualistic human sacrifice of
           six people (The significance of Six
           being related to the biblical
           number of man and creation) in
           order to induce the spirit of their
           God, The Dark Master, who they
           believed manifested his powers
           through his devoted followers,
           giving them immortality. The
           hundred strong tribe settled in
           Amityville but were later chased
           off the land by local Christians.
           Satchem accused the Christians of
           not properly compensating his tribe
           for the land. A war started and the
           Christians hired a hunter called
           John Underhill from Salem. At the
           site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue
           was later built in Amityville,
           Underhill killed all of the tribe.
           The Indians were buried in a mass
           grave on the site. Before he died
           Satchem vowed revenge. According to
           local legend, Chief Satchem is
           believed to have subsequently
           haunted the land. Various
           parapsychologists and mediums have
           65.
                         
                         
           claimed that Satchem's vengeful
           spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo
           murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue
           and the haunting of the subsequent
           owners. Although such assertions
           are widely disputed.

           You told me the other night that
           you think evil is within us all.
           But do you think that people can be
           influenced by an evil that comes
           from outside of themselves?
                         
                          DELANEY
           Are you still thinking about this?
                         
                          LISA
           I guess I am yeah.
                         
                          DELANEY
           I worry that you're thinking too
           much. This place is getting to you.
                          LISA
           There's something going on in this
           place. Something sinister. And I
           don't just mean the patients on
           Ward X. Have you not noticed that?
                         
                          DELANEY
           I've noticed some things.
                         
                          LISA
           Why haven't you said anything? Or
           done anything?

          Delaney contemplates for a moment.
                         
                          DELANEY
           It's like the honey bee.
                         
                          LISA
           What do you mean?
                         
                          DELANEY
           The honey bee is fine when it's
           just flying from flower to flower.
           Then they think that a person is a
           threat and they sting them. They
           might leave a sting but the person
           will recover. The bee dies. So I
           ask myself... is it worth it?
                         
          Delaney returns his attention to the cup of coffee in his
          hands as Lisa disappears into her own thoughts.

          Lisa is sat in an armchair with a laptop resting on her
          thighs. On screen she is reading a Wikipedia entry:
                         
          "The Satchem Tribe was a tribe of Native American origin
          that existed in the 18th Century. They fled Massachusetts and
          settled in Amityville where they were ultimately murdered
          over a land dispute. The Tribe was renowned for practices in
          line with Witchcraft and worshipped a God called The Dark
          Master. In 2009, it emerged that a modern cult incarnation
          of the tribe existed. They have adopted the traditional
          beliefs of the Satchem tribe but the modern followers are
          not required to be of Native American origin."
                         
          Lisa scrolls down to the References section. She clicks on a
          link. A Blog appears on screen entitled The Dark Master: An
          Ancient Vision for A Modern World. She reads the latest Blog
                         POST:
                         
          "Our time is at hand. On November 13th 2013, 6 souls will be
          sacrificed so that The Dark Master's devoted followers may
          be blessed with immortality. As non-believers perish on
          doomsday the Master's loyal subjects shall live on and be
          bestowed with great power and responsibility for the
          direction of the New World."Lisa opens up the Calendar on
          her computer. November 13th is the day after tomorrow. Lisa
          refers back to the blog and notices the author of the last
          blog post: "SisterSadie".
           67.
                         
                         
          Lisa's mind is racing. Lisa types 'Sadie Krenwinkel' into a
          Search Engine. The first result is a Wikipedia entry. Lisa
          clicks on it. She reads:
                         
          "Sadie Krenwinkel is a convicted murderer and former member
          of The Satchem Cult, a modern incarnation of a Native
          American tribe who practiced Witchcraft in the 18th Century.
          In 2009, Krenwinkel led ten members of the cult to 1005
          Dennison Drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered
          five individuals. One potential victim managed to escape and
          lead police to Krenwinkel. At her trial in 2010, Krenwinkel
          outlined the beliefs of the Satchem Cult, claiming the human
          sacrifice of six individuals would have given them
          immortality. As a result her lawyer submitted a plea of
          insanity and Krenwinkel was subsequently sentenced to
          indefinite incarceration in a mental institution."
          Lisa reads further down the page and notices that the name
          of the Doctor who testified to her insanity at her trial:
          DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER.

          Lisa slides open the hatch and looks inside. The cell is
          covered in lit candles with Sadie sat cross legged in the
          centre of the room.

          Lisa slides the hatch shut. She walks over to the last door
          on the left. Lisa slides the hatch open and peers in. The
          resident John Doe sits in the shadows. Suddenly he sits
          forward and a bright shaft of daylight illuminates his face.
          Lisa is shocked to see a face she recognises from the
          internet article staring at her. The face of RONALD "BUTCH"
          DEFEO JUNIOUR. Lisa slams the hatch shut and backs down the
          hallway, her mind racing as fast as her pulse rate.

           I am aware of the DeFeo murders
           yes. The hauntings... well I think
           it's common perception now that a
           lot of that was exaggerated by the
           media.
                         
                          LISA
           Maybe. Are you aware of the history

           There were a group of Native
           Americans in Amityville known as
           "The Satchem Tribe". They were

           Yes. Sadie Krenwinkel down on Ward
           X. She shares the beliefs of the
           Satchem Tribe. I have reason to
           believe that somehow she has access
           to the internet and Witchcraft
           paraphernalia and she's planning on
           a human sacrifice tonight to try
           and raise the God she believes in,
           The Dark Master, and become
           immortal.

          Then someone is helping her get
          access to this stuff! Someone who
          works here! Please Doctor Mixter.
          Just check out her cell and speak
          to her. If I'm wrong about this and
          it's all just her delusions then
          fine. I'll accept that. But I had
          to tell you. You testified at her
          trial didn't you?
                         
                          MIXTER
          Yes I did. What are you implying?
                         
                          LISA
          Nothing. I just meant you know how
          dangerous she is.
                         
                          MIXTER
          Yes, I understand how dangerous she
          is and I appreciate you coming to
          express your concerns. One thing
          you need to bear in mind Lisa is
          that there are some very sick
          patients at this institution. We do
          our best to help those who can be
          helped but unfortunately the
          patients on Ward X are beyond help.
          Their personality disorders are too
          advanced, their delusions are too
          grandiose. I worry that perhaps you
          have been rather taken in by one of
          those delusions.
                         
                          LISA
          I know that it might sound like
          that. But can you check her cell

          on the internet, see if you can
          connect the IP number of the writer
          with a computer here at the

          Okay look. That does take time and
          resources I don't necessarily have.
          But as you've come to me with a
          concern of patient infraction and
          potential threat of violence, I am
          duty bound to investigate.

           In fact, I'll order a cell search
           immediately. Stay here for a
           moment, I'll be right back.
                         
          Mixter exits. Lisa leans forward and a file on the desk
          catches her eye. She stands up and reaches over for it. Her
          NAME is on it. Lisa opens it up. Inside is a form Committing
          her to the hospital as a PATIENT. Lisa looks down and the
          reason stated is PARANOID DELUSION. The date on the form is
          November 13th. Today. Lisa slams the file shut and the office
          door opens. She turns to see Mixter stood there with
          Hardcastle and another orderly.

           This is for your own good Lisa. You
           need treatment.
                         
          The orderlies approach her. Lisa lashes out but the two men
          overpower her, grabbing her arms and then tripping her. She
          hits the floor with a thud. Mixter produces a syringe from
          behind his back.

          Lisa awakens, sat in the corner of a cold white cell. She
          tries to get up before realising she's strapped into a
          straight jacket. Lisa SCREAMS. The hatch opens and Mixter
          peers in. The hatch then closes and the door opens. Mixter
          enters.

           will be sedated again.
                         
          Mixter walks over and sits on the edge of the bed.
                         
                          LISA
           Why are you doing this?
                         
                          MIXTER
           You're having paranoid delusions.
           I'm also aware that you've been
           having disturbing visions.
                         
                          LISA
           I'm not having delusions, I know
           what I've seen!
                         
                          MIXTER
           Well you think you know. The human
           brain is a powerful thing and I'm
           sure you do believe what you've
           seen. But it's all in your mind
           Lisa, it's not reality. You're a
           very sick girl and you need
           treatment.
                         
                          LISA
           You do this to all your staff huh?
           The minute we speak out we get
           fucking committed??
                         
                          MIXTER
           Staff? You were never staff here
           Lisa. You're a patient here. You've
           always been a patient here.
                         
          Lisa appears confused.
                         
                          LISA
           No, no. You're lying to me, I know
           who I am! I KNOW WHO I AM!!
                          MIXTER
           I'm afraid not my dear. You've
           always been with us here. Initially
           as an out patient but now the
           delusions have progressed I feel
           it's time for you to become a full
           time resident.

          Lisa becomes upset. Tears stream down her face.

           Look, I understand it's a lot to
           process now. I'll leave you to
           think about it and then we'll begin
           counselling sessions tomorrow.

                          MIXTER
           Listen, how about I take this
           straight jacket off so you're more
           comfortable?
                         
                          LISA
           Thank you.
                         
                          MIXTER
           First you must take this. It will
           help you sleep.
                         
          Mixter hands Lisa a red pill and a bottle of water. She
          takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp
          of water.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Good girl. I know it's a lot to
           take in but together we'll get
           through this. Now I'm going to take
           your restraint off. Remember
           though, if you're violent then I
           promise you it will go straight
           back on. Okay?
                         
                          LISA
           Okay.
                         
          Mixter unties the straight jacket at the back and lifts it
          off.
                         
                          MIXTER

           No problem. I'm going to leave you
           get some rest now. Tomorrow we
           start the healing process.
                         
                         
          Mixter exits. The echo of the steel door closing
          reverberates around the tiny cell. We hear Mixter's
          footsteps as he walks down the hallway. Lisa's upset
          demeanour disappears immediately. She spits the red pill
          into the palm of her hand.

          The lock of the door turns. Patient X's eyes snap open. The
          door opens. Mixter is stood in the doorway, dressed in a
          hooded black robe. He holds the Marlin rifle in his hands.
          He approaches Patient X and holds out the rifle and a box of
          shells. Patient X takes them. Mixter walks out.

          and all of the doors unlock. Patient X is stood in the
          doorway of his cell, rifle at his side. Sadie rushes out of
          her cell and sees him. A broad smile spreads on her face.
          She turns to Mixter.

           ours!
          Patient X raises the rifle and squeezes the trigger. The
          BLAST rips through the back of Sadie's head, blowing half of
          her face away. She is killed instantly and her lifeless
          corpse drops to the floor. Mixter smiles and leaves the

          glass doesn't break. The lock on the door snaps. Lisa slides
          down the wall, terrified. The door opens and DELANEY walks
          in. Lisa breathes a huge sigh of relief and rushes over,
          throwing her arms around him.

           We need to save ourselves. Let them
           reap what they've sewn.
                         
          Delaney grabs Lisa and they run down the hallway, as the
          patients beat the orderlies with their own truncheons.

          Lisa and Delaney rush down the hallway. They turn a corner
          and are stopped in their tracks by the GHOST of ALLISON
          DEFEO stood in the centre of the hallway clutching a teddy
          bear. She has a HUGE bullet hole in the centre of her
          forehead, blood dripping down her face.
                         
                          ALLISON
           Why don't you want to play with me?
          CRASH! A door at the other end of the hallway is kicked
          open. Patient X bursts through and aims the rifle. Lisa and
          Delaney rush back down the hallway. A BULLET HITS the wall
          just as they turn into an open doorway.

          Lisa and Delaney are running through the hallway. They burst
          through a door.

          Lisa and Delaney find themselves in the shower room. Mould
          covers the walls and all of the showers are on, gushing
          dirty water. They spot another door on the other side of the
           79.
                         
                         
          shower room but blocking their path to it is a thin middle
          aged man in a white vest and white shorts, facing the wall.
          He is whispering to himself. Lisa and Delaney stop.
                          LISA
           Hey mister, you need to get the
           hell out of here, there's a patient
           going crazy with a gun!!
                         
          The man turns around. His face is weathered and his eyes are
          wild and bloodshot.
                         
                          MAN
           My...my skin's on too tight!
                         
                          DELANEY
           What?
                         
                          MAN
           My skin is on too tight!
                         
          Delaney grabs Lisa and they start ebbing past the man
          towards the door. The man is getting increasingly more
          agitated, scratching at his face.
                         
                          MAN
           My skin's on too tight!!
                         
          The man reaches into the pocket of his shorts and produces a
          scalpel.
                         
                          MAN
           My skin is on too tight!!
                         
          The man STABS his cheek with the scalpel. Lisa SCREAMS! The
          man drags the scalpel around his face in one continuous
          motion, blood seeping from the circular gash. As Lisa and
          Delaney watch on in horror the man RIPS the skin off his
          face, exposing muscles and veins. His white vest and shorts
          are now saturated with blood. The man sighs with relief.
                         
                          MAN
           That's much better.
                         
          A horrified Lisa and Delaney rush towards the door and BURST
          through it.

          Delaney and Lisa rush towards the main doors. They're
          locked. Delaney fumbles for a set of keys.
                         
                          LISA
           Come on, hurry, please!!
                         
          Delaney finds the right key. He checks the lock and realises
          that a key has been snapped off in it.
                         
                          DELANEY

           A fucking key's been snapped in the
           lock!
          Delaney rushes to the reception desk and grabs a chair. He
          rushes over to a window next to the door and raises the
          chair. BANG! A bullet tears through his back and exits
          through his chest with an explosion of blood. Lisa SCREAMS!
          Delaney drops to his knees and Lisa rushes to his side.
          Patient X loads fresh cartridges in the rifle. Delaney is
          DEAD. Lisa runs down the hallway. Patient X takes aim. Just
          as Lisa bursts through a door, a bullet blasts apart one
          side of the frame.

          LISA'S POV ­ Patient X bursts through the door and pursues
          her. Lisa keeps running as Patient X aims the gun.
                         
          Lisa looks back just as he fires and the BULLET narrowly
          misses her, the force sending her crashing into a stack of
          chairs. Her leg catches on the chairs and she falls to the
          ground. Lisa crawls towards a door. Hauling herself up she
          manages to turn the handle and the door swings open.

          just as she falls through the door, the SHOT blowing the
          door apart.

          but it's locked. She tries another-also locked. Lisa
          finally finds a door that is open and she rushes through.

          Lisa enters a small staff room. She SLAMS the door behind
          her. She clicks the lock. Lisa steps back from the door. She
          JUMPS as Patient X POUNDS on the door from the other side.
          Lisa looks around for a weapon. She limps toward the cutlery
          drawer below a sink. She rustles inside and finds a large
          butcher knife. Suddenly the door EXPLODES, a large hole
          blown through the middle of it by the GUN SHOT. Patient X
          reaches through, groping for the lock. Lisa reaches a large
          window in the room. She tries to lift the window. After an
          unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window
          is nailed down.

          Patient X reaches for the lock. Lisa dashes to the storage
          cupboard and ducks inside.

          Lisa pulls the door shut and falls to the floor of the dark
          interior. Lisa faces the door, bracing herself with the
          knife held upwards. Everything is quiet. Suddenly the door
          SHAKES as Patient X THUMPS on it. The door cracks as Patient
          X SMASHES against it. Lisa crouches down with the knife at
          the ready.

          The gun BLOWS a HOLE right through the door. Patient X leans
          through the hole, peering down at Lisa crouched on the
          floor. He aims the gun through the hole and prepares to
          fire. Lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with
          all her might. The blade RIPS through Patient X's right eye.
          He SCREAMS and drops the gun in the cupboard before
          stumbling backwards into the staff room. Patient X clasps
          his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. Lisa
          grabs the gun and stands up. Patient X looks at her with his
          remaining eye. Lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the
          door.
                         
                          LISA
           Lights out, you son-of-a-bitch!!
          BANG! The shot gun BLASTS a hole through Patient X's chest,
          blood splatters over Lisa. Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the
          room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises. She is dressed in a
          clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds.
          Allison takes the hand of PATIENT X's corpse. The WHITE
          LIGHT swarms over Patient X's body and he rises to his feet.
          His head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. He
          looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile. Allison
          walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a
          blinding WHITE LIGHT. They disappear and the light slowly
          dissipates.

          Lisa, covered in blood, walks through the hallway with the
          rifle by her side. She reaches the door to Doctor Mixter's
          office and kicks it open. Mixter is sat behind his desk, now
          dressed in his usual shirt and tie. Lisa aims the gun at
          Mixter whose hands are beneath the table.

           Master who blesses all of his
           followers with power and

           that's all we need tonight.

          Suddenly SIRENS can be heard outside. The screeching of car
          wheels. Mixter smiles. Lisa, still holding the gun at
          Mixter, shuffles over to the window and peers through the
          blinds. The car park is full of police cars. A dozen armed
          police officers rush towards the building. Lisa looks back
          to see Mixter chuckling.

          Outside they hear the police rushing down the hallway.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Tell me something Lisa, would it
           help your grief over your mother if
           you knew she was a slut?
                         
                          LISA
           What did you say??
                         
                          MIXTER
           Yes. That's why she's burning in
           hell.
                         
          Lisa, her teeth clenched, moves forward and places the
          business end of the rifle against Mixter's temple.
                         
                          LISA
           You shut the fuck about my mother,
           you don't know anything!!
                         
                          MIXTER
           I know that sometimes you wonder
           why you don't cry enough for her. I
           know you feel guilty for not doing
           more for her when she was alive.
           You feel guilty for moving on with
           85.
                         
                         
           your life and forgetting about
           her!!
                         
                          LISA
           I have not forgotten about her!!
                         
                          MIXTER
           Face it Lisa, you never cared for
           her. You never cared for anyone but
           yourself. She's looking up from the
           bowels of hell now knowing that you
           never loved her!
                         
          Tears stream down Lisa's face. She's crumbling.
                         
                          LISA
           SHUT UP!! SHUT UP!!
                         
                          MIXTER
           She was a whore!
                         
          Lisa HITS Mixter over the head with the butt of the rifle.
          He falls to the ground and looks up at a crazed Lisa.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Your mother's in hell and you don't
           care!!
                         
                          LISA
           Fuck you!!
                         
                         
          Lisa aims the rifle at Mixter's face. Suddenly the police
          burst in. Lisa spins around, the rifle still in her hands.
                         
          POLICE OPEN FIRE! Her body is riddled with BULLETS and she
          falls to the floor in a blood soaked heap.

           And we're back with our next guest.
           A year ago he was a survivor of the
           High Hopes Hospital mass murder
           when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran
           amok with a rifle, claiming six
           victims and injuring many others.
           Doctor Elliot Mixter has written a
           new book entitled 'Shattered Hopes'
           which provides an account of that
           fateful night as well as some
           background into the mind of the
           murderer. Doctor Mixter, good
           morning.
                         
          Mixter is sat opposite, in a very expensive suit.
                         
                          MIXTER
           Morning Katherine, how are you?
                         
                          PRESENTER
           I'm good thank you. So Doctor, can
           you tell us a little more about the
           book?
                         
                          MIXTER
           Well, it features a blow by blow
           account of the evening. It was
           obviously a very harrowing
           experience and for me it was rather
           therapeutic to deal with my
           feelings about what happened in
           writing.
                         
                          PRESENTER
           How has it affected the hospital
           Doctor?
                         
                          MIXTER
           Obviously we were all left very
           numb by events for a long time and
           I know a lot of people in the town
           felt we should close the
           institution. But that never
           occurred to me. I feel that people
           should be brought closer by tragedy
           and the Staff and I have definitely
           become closer, both as colleagues
           and friends, since the incident.
           That bond makes for a better
           87.
                         
                         
           institution in my opinion, so we
           will continue to go from strength
           to strength.
                         
                          PRESENTER
           You mentioned there that some
           people wanted the place to close. I
           know many were also resistant to
           the opening of the institution in
           the first place given that it was
           built on the site of the infamous
           house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered
           his family in the seventies. I know
           a lot of people associated with
           that case were accused of
           exploiting it for their own ends.
           You've also faced some criticism
           for that, particularly as we heard
           last week that you have sold the
           movie rights to this book. How do
           you respond to that criticism?
                         
                          MIXTER
           Well I know that some people accuse
           me of hurting the memory of the
           victims but I feel I'm helping the
           memories of those involved live on.
           Granted, some victims were
           criminally insane but other victims
           were loyal staff who had families
           and I'm determined that they not be
           forgotten. Each staff member gets
           their own chapter in the book so
           that the readers can get a full
           picture of what wonderful people
           they were. I always say that all
           forms of media, whether it be
           books, newspapers, TV or movies,
           are a preservation of life. Our
           physical bodies may die but our
           images live on when we are famous.
           Our work and our passion is
           preserved, therefore it's as if our
           souls are preserved. Through all of
           these forms of media we are, in
           effect, immortal.
                         
                         
          Mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles.

          The sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around
          a Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes around our ears.

          EXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY
          The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated
          stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible
          distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation,
          excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO
          CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,
          for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and
          -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -
          - sets the scene.

          us over for the weekend, and we're waiting for the ferry now to take
          us there...
           (blushing, mortified to cameraman)
          I don't know what else to say!
                         
          CAMERAMAN (CHAZ'S VOICE)
          Tell us something about yourself.
                         
                         SWEET COED
          Something about myself? Oh, Gee...
          (composing herself, earnestly)
          Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my
          best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on
          the first date.

          Kit waves him off, laughing in spite of herself. She's got nothing to

          upper-crust kid. Skip also happens to be Muffy's cousin.
                         
                         ARCH

          Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date...
                         
          Skip cracks up. Arch's laughter follows.

          Where's Rob?

          Oh, Kit...
                         
          Concerned, Kit keeps her humor anyway, waving the lens away again.
                         
                         KIT
          Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you?
                         
          He does, finally shutting down the videopak. The image reverts to FILM
          again.

          SUBURBAN LADY -- and the passenger, ROB FERRIS a cleancut,
          goodlooking, 20 year old public school grad ­sit in uncomfortable
          silence on opposite ends of the front seat.
                         
                         ROB

          The Volvo wagon pulls over. Rob drags out his daypack, too.

          (smiles, no reason for disappointment)
          It was a real lift for me, too, hon.
                         
          A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the
          highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road
          sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction.
                         
          Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan.
                         
          The Volvo wagon continues on, braking for the next undergraduate
          male hitchhiking down the road.

          The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my
          way...
                         
          She hears a CLATTER from down below.
          INT. BASEMENT - DAY
                         
          MUFFY ST. JOHN drags a woman's body across the floor. The arm comes
          off in her hand.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Shit.
                         
                         CLARA'S VOICE
          Need any help down there?
                         
          Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm
          still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place
          of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including
          the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in
          an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (puffing with the effort)
          No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down
          here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...!
                         
                         CLARA
          Sure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around
          here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know...
                         
                         MUFFY
          (continuing with her work)
          Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd
          do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.
                         
                         CLARA
          (dubiously , turning to go)
          All right, then. Have a nice party.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (a buoyant laugh)
          Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody
          unforgettable!
                         
          Clara climbs the stairs.
                         
                         CLARA
          Good luck.
                         
                         MUFFY (CONT)
          Bye, Clara. See you Monday.
                         
          Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind
          Clara.
          Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining
          clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a
          ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible
          departing the grounds.
                         
          Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the
          sounds.
                         
          INT. UTILITY ROOM
                         
          Part of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink
          and large incinerator. Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,
          overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --
          slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly
          dripping faucet.
                         
          EXT. FERRY LANDING - MAINLAND - DAY
                         
          CHAZ, the videocameraman and the only member of the group we haven't
          seen till now, is the first to spot the ferry approaching.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Here she comes...
                         
          He's a real hi-tech freak and Ivy League wiseass, a free spirit in
          neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight
          videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end
          of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are
          distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.
                         
          ANGLE - PARKING LOT
                         
          It's not Rob, though. It's NAN, another newcomer. She pulls her car
          next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and -
          gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat. She
          is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town
          girl, overdressed for the occasion.
                         
                         NAN
                         (HURRIED)
          Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?
                         
                         NIKKI I
          Any second now.
                         
                         NAN
          Oh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road...
                         
          Kit smiles welcome, lending a hand as Nan struggles the bag up the
          ramp.
                         KIT
          Hi. Kit Graham... Nikki Brashears.
                         
                         NAN
          Nan Youngblood.
                         
                         NIKKI
          (needling, about the suitcase)
          Planning on staying a while?
                         
                         NAN
          (flushes, embarrassed)
          Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't
          know how far behind I am...
                         
          Arch outhustles Chaz for her bag. Her simple attractiveness exerts an
          appeal.
                         
                         ARCH
          Hi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right?
                         
                         CHAZ
          Chaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs.
                         
                         NIKKI
          (pointed1y, reminds him)
          Chaz, Arch already has her bag.
                         
          Meaning, Chaz is Nikki's man, especially for this weekend.
                         
                         NAN
          (volunteering, happily)
          Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to
          do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's
          so talented. She was wonderful!
                         
                         SKIP
          (to Nan, approvingly; in greeting)
          Congratulations, on finding your way.
                         
          The landing BUMPS, the ferry touches down. They look up.
                         
                         ANGLE CHANGE
                         
                         FERRYMAN
                         (BARKS)
          Stand clear!
                         
          The large, raw-boned FERRYMAN holds open the wooden stile for the one
          and only passenger from the island ­ Clara -- to disembark. Clara
          passes them , giving first Skip and then the others a look, shaking
          her head in sad appraisal.
          FERRYMAN (cont.)
                         (GROWLS)
          Ok, let's go.
                         
          It's not the friendliest greeting in the world. The ferryman keeps the
          stile open for them to board singly. There is also a younger assistant
          on board -- BUCK, a pleasant, openfaced townie in his 20s.
                         
          FERRYMAN (cont.)
          To the rear. Outa the operator's way.
                         
          Nikki clutches at Skip's arm.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (IN MOCK-TERROR)
          This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where
          men are men, and women oughta know better?
                         
                         ARCH
                         (BEHIND HER)
          Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (SUGGESTIVE )
          You could tie me in chains...
                         
          Chaz boards, passing Buck, the assistant.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (a low whisper)
          Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out...
                         
          The assistant gapes, falling for it, groping his fly. Which is closed,
          of course. He looks up, grinning. Chaz kisses him on the cheek, winks
          and moves on.
                         
                         BUCK
          Sh -i-i-t...
                         
          Kit is hanging back on the dock.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Come on if you're coming.
                         
                         KIT
                         (URGENTLY)
          Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody --
                         
                         FERRYMAN
                         (GRUFFLY)
          It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime.
                         KIT
          But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over.
          If he misses this...
                         
          Arch WHISTLES loudly, seeing and alerting them.
                         
          PARKING LOT - THEIR POV
          A late model Detroit sedan (the one we saw earlier turning off the
          highway) pulls to a fast stop in the lot. Rob hurries out; a CHEER
          comes up from the group on the ferry. Kit closes her eyes in relief.
          Rob comes hurrying up the ramp.
                         
                         ANGLE ­ LANDING
          ...followed closely by HARVEY 'HAL' EDISON, JR.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Wait up!
                         
          Harvey is the driver of the sedan, and after he carefully locks up, he
          comes running with his bag, too. He is a rangy, straight-arrow Ivy
          League farmboy from the Border South, and he's the last of Muffy's
          invited guests. He also, somewhat incongruously, sports a Bruce
          Springsteen badge.
                         
                         ROB
          (to Kit, kissing her)
          Sorry... Nik, Chaz...
          (to Skip and Nan whom he doesn't know)
          Rob Ferris...
                         
          They return greetings.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (RIGHT BEHIND )
          Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks
          call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty
          spot.
                         
          Stylistically, he's a Martian. Chaz stares at him.
                         
                         CHAZ
          You're friends with... Muffy St. John?
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (PROUDLY)
          Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal
          utility curves.
                         
                         NIKKI
          I get it. That's a joke.
          Preppy Skip adds his greeting.
                         
                         SKIP
          (an ironical nod)
          Harve.
                         
                         HARVEY
          (correcting him, blithely)
          Hal...
          (noticing interest his badge)
          Springsteen, he's still the Boss!
                         
                         FERRYMAN
                         (IMPATIENTLY)
          Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day.
                         
          He slams the stile down after Harvey, the last to board, and gets busy
          with the stubborn motor. His assistant helps. Chaz tapes.
                         
                         HARVEY
          (enthusiastically, putting down his fear)
          YOU all buddies?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met.

                         (MEANING SKIP)
          Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin.

          Distant. Over the horizon.
          Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited...
          (frowns, tellingly)
          Old money never mixes family with friends.
                         
                         NIKKI
          This is true. For as long as I've known her.

          He turns to Arch, holds up his hand, and CLICK, a switchblade opens
          into the lens.
                         
          SKIP (cont.)

          Ok, so don't believe me.
                         
          He keeps the tape rolling. Rob discreetly looks down. His fly is
          open. Kit looks at him dubiously. Rob zips. Chaz beams, getting it all
          for posterity. The engine finally engages. The ferry lurches.
                         
                         ROB
          (smiles weakly to Kit)
          We're off!
                         
          They are indeed.
                         
          EXT. THE SOUND - DISTANT POV - DAY
                         
          The ferry pulls away from the mainland.
                         
          EXT. THE FERRY - DAY
                         
          A CLOSER ANGLE. The sturdy, barge like ship craft makes progress. The
          Ferryman and Buck remain at the stern.
                         
          ECU - THE DECK
                         
          As Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds.
          SKIP AND ARCH
                         
          at their game. Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples
          over.
                         
          Skip hoots triumphantly.
                         
                         SKIP
          First round, the champ!
                         
          NIKKI AND HARVEY
                         
          Nikki, much to her chagrin, finds herself the object of Harvey's
          attentions.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean,
          I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must
          stand for something... Muffin?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster...
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (GRINS)
          I bet you're her oldest friend.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (BORED)
          Actually, she's three months older than I am.
                         
                         HARVEY
          You know what I mean.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up?
                         
                         HARVEY
          I've given it some thought. Why?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Oh, just a hunch.
                         
                         HARVEY
          First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's
          company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation...
          Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter!
                         
          She just stares at him.
          CLOSE UP - THE KNIFE
                         
          digging into the deck again.
                         
          ARCH (O.S.)
          Jesus...
                         
          ARCH and SKIP
                         
          The knife is at an impossible distance.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (LAUGHING)
          Go for it, big fella.
                         
          Arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt.
                         
                         CHAZ
          fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own.

          (sitting beside her)
          Whatcha readin'?
                         
                         NAN
          Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the
          English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people
          read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours?
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (SHOWS HER)
          Suck and fuck.
                         
          Naked bodies writhing in heat. Women with their tongues sticking out
          in desparate desire... Nan tries to control her reaction to his stack
          of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines.
                         
                         CHAZ (CONT)
          The origins of American pornographic film. I'm taking an
          independent study this term.
          (the passion and commitment show)
          My advisor's really behind me on it. We're not gonna be sheltered
          college kids all our lives. Someday I'm gonna have kids --
          you're gonna have kids ­ and someday that kid's gonna come up
          to me and say, 'God, Dad, porn's really a major part of our
          lives. You were there, how'd it get started?' I wanna be
          able to answer their questions.
                         (SMILES)
          Besides, it's research I can do by myself.
                         
          ROB AND KIT
          They keep their voices low.
                         KIT
                         (STILL MIFFED)
          That's not my point --
                         
                         ROB
          You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but
          I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some
          of you private college kids do.
                         
                         KIT
          Oh, c'mon, don't pull that.
                         
          Rob just drops his arms in frustration.
                         
          KIT (cont.)
          I mean, it may show something about your attitude toward me,
          always being late.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit...
                         
          Arch's voice interrupts.
                         
                         ARCH'S VOICE
          (annoyed, loudly, overriding the other conversations)
          Hey, I'm really not interested anymore --
                         
                         SKIP
          C'mon, just one more
                         
          The others look up at the interruption.
                         
                         ANGLE
                         
          Arch pushes the knife back into Skip's hand, tired of playing knife-
          toss.
                         
                         ARCH
          I said, enough's enough--
                         
                         SKIP
          One more try, double or nothing.
                         
          He flips the knife to Arch, handle first.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (PISSED OFF)
          C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest!
                         
          He flips it back hard. Something happens. Skip looks up stunned.
          Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror.
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
                         
          Skip stares back, disbelieving, looking down and pulling his hand away
          from his chest, where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife
          sticks out, buried hilt-deep between his ribs.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (PALE)
          Oh, fuck.
                         
                         SKIP
          Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry.
          Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in
          disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and
          splashes overboard. He goes under.
                         
                         ARCH
          (panicked, hurrying to the side)
          I'll get him, I'll get him!
                         
          But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear.
                         
          Rob rushes forward, with Chaz in reserve, pulling Arch out of ·the
          way. But Buck, the assistant ferryman, pre-empts them all, diving in.
                         
          Arch, frozen, watches from the deck with the others.
                         
          Buck resurfaces, but without any sign of Skip. Rob doesn't wait any
          longer. He pulls off his shoes and dives in. Chaz gets ready to follow
          suit. The panic mounts. Suddenly:
                         
                         SKIP'S VOICE
          Hi, this what you're looking for?
                         
                         THEY TURN;
                         
                         ANGLE CHANGE
                         
          Skip pulls himself up, dripping, on the other side of the ferry. He
          holds up the knife -- and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to
          imbed the knife -- and grins from ear to ear. The others stare,
          totally freaked.
                         
          Arch lets go, jumping in the air. Rob and Buck surface, to see as
          well.
                         
                         ARCH
          We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em!
                         CHAZ
          (as it dawns, to Skip)
          April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks...
          somebody could've gotten hurt out there!
                         
          Relief descends. Rob isn't laughing. But nobody's more impressed than
          assistant Buck, still treading water.
                         
                         BUCK
                         (GRINNING)

          You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack!
                         
          Kit glowers at them and gives Rob a hand to get out.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (TO CHAZ)
          Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelace­is-untied crap!
                         
                         ROB
          (dripping, to Arch and Skip)
          I owe you one.
                         
                         SKIP
          (smiles, to Buck in the water)
          How's it goin' out there?
                         
                         BUCK
          That was great!
                         
                         SKIP
          I was really counting on these other turkeys to save
          my ass.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Oh, too bad.
                         
          Skip extends a hand to Buck to help him out.
                         
                         SKIP
          Sorry about that.
                         
          But Buck's in no hurry. The ferryman steps forward.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          (unamused, to Buck)
          Ok, c'mon, get out.
                         
          They are approaching the landing dock on the island.
          FERRYMAN (CONT.)
          (to Buck, gruffly)
          C'mon I'm gonna need some help here.
                         
          Buck obeys, but his way, enjoying it, ducking under the craft to swim
          to the other side to help.
                         
                         FERRYMAN (CONT)
          And watch out for the wire!
                         
          Too late. There's a sickening THUMP I The young assistant suddenly
          breaks the surface qf the water, panicked and stunned, gasping for
          air.
                         
          It happens too fast for any of them to do anything. Buck thrashes,
          dazed, off-balance, falling back into the path of the ferry as it
          glides toward the landing.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Buck, look out--
                         
                         ROB
                         (IN DREAD)
          Oh, shit...
                         
          The ferryman grabs the controls, but it can't help.
                         
          The ferry, unstoppable, plows into Buck, pinning him against one of
          the piers. Buck screams.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Buck!
                         
          The ferryman rushes forward to help.
                         
          For a moment the others are spared the horror of it as the
          Ferryman's back blocks their view.
                         
          But then Buck, thrashing in the water, tears himself, loose, screaming
          and bobbing. up, his head and torso covered in blood, the side of his
          face and his shoulder hideously deformed.
                         
          It is awful. It is ghastly. And it is unforgettable.
                         
                         KIT

          EXT. DOCK - ISLAND - DAY
                         
          SAM POTTER, the middle-aged township constable, hears the cries and
          the screams. He drops what he's doing in his outboard and comes
          running.
                         
          EXT. LANDING - ISLAND - DAY
                         
          The ferryman jumps into the shallow water, pulling Buck onto shore.
          Rob, Chaz and Arch jump after to help, but the ferryman pushes them
          angrily away.
                         
                         FERRYMAN
          Get away from him!
                         
          Buck is hysterical. The gashes of torn flesh seem to drip from his
          skull. Seeing Rob and the others, he screams, lunging vainly at· them
          in agony.
                         
                         BUCK
          They did it... them!
                         
                         FERRYMAN
                         (RESTRAINING HIM)
          Easy Buck... it's OK... OK... There's time for
          Later... easy...
                         
          But it's hard for him to restrain his own rage.
                         
          Constable Potter arrives, throwing the ferryman a towel to use. The
          ferryman catches it, pressing it against Buck's torn face. One
          maddened, glaring eye still stares out hideously at the group.
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
                         (TO ·FERRYMAN)
          Get him to the hospital, Cal! Take my boat!
                         
          He helps the ferryman lift Buck. But the powerful ferryman needs no
          further help, carrying Buck to the Constable's motorboat moored
          nearby, laying Buck in, untying the line and pulling the motor to
          life. Buck continues to shriek, terrifyingly.
                         
          The ferryman cast one last glance back.
                         
          EXT. THE LANDING
                         
          The SOUND of the motorboat fades away. Potter turns back to the
          stunned group, eyeing them.
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
          All right... Let's have it.
          INT. MUFFY'S PASSENGER VAN - DAY
                         
          Muffy drives up. She slows, seeing, through the windshield the somber
          scene at the pier... her friends in troubled conversation with
          Constable Potter.
                         
          EXT. LANDING - DAY
                         
          Muffy gets out, parking the new van beside an old island pick-up which
          is kept at the dock. She's clean, and dressed in her more usual preppy
          garb. She approaches.
                         
                         MUFFY
          What's going on? Sam... what's wrong?
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
                         (IN DISGUST)
          Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just
          took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here...
                         
          She returns his stare in dread silence. He boards the ferry.
                         
          CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.)
          I came over to check on a report of some unauthorized
          activity in the area... Your dad around?
                         
          She startles, the question 50 unanticipated.
                         
                         MUFFY
          No, he's in Sutton Place. Why?
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
          No word from him, or anybody else?
                         
                         MUFFY

          No...
                         
          He tries the engine. Nothing.
                         
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
          Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless...
                         
          He steps back onto the shore.
                         
          CONSTABLE POTTER (CONT.)
          I'll have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore.
                         
                         MUFFY
          We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I
          think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there.
          She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged.
                         
          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or
          anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you.
                         
          The van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest. From what
          we can see of its occupants, the mood is pretty grim. Behind it, the
          old island pick-up truck follows.
                         
          INT. PICK-UP
                         
          Rob drives with Kit and Skip beside him in the cab. Nobody says
          anything . Skip is off somewhere in his own private hell. Finally he
          reaches over to roll down his window, but the handle rotates uselessly
          in his grip.

          He starts banging violently on the door, on the window.

                         KIT
          Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know.
                         
                         SKIP

          Sure.
                         
          He leaves off his banging. Pause.

          It is a truly grand affair, two stories at least, rambling and
          picture-perfect with extensive tended grounds, garage, and
          outbuildings. Muffy gets out first, hopping around to the back to open
          the rear van gate for the bags. Nan beholds the house for the first
          time.

          Chaz stands before a large, beautifully polished dining table that is

          presidents and other heads of state.
                         
          He steps over to the desk, opens a cigar box sitting there, takes out
          a cigar and slips it into his pocket.
          EXT. BACK LAWN - SUNSET
                         
          Arch and Chaz are in the back lawn overlooking the sound. They are
          fooling around with Chaz's camera, maybe clowning a bit.

          A'broad veranda which runs along the entire length of the back of the
          house. Skip and Nan are sitting on the railing, gazing over the
          sounds. Skip has a drink.

          I guess what I'm trying to say is... you always seem to get there
          first... but this time Chaz is mine, OK?
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (AMUSED)
          What about Hal?

          Harvey? Mr. Junior Achievement? Oh please...
                         
          Muffy returns her smile,continuing down the corridor.
          INT. ARCH'S POOM - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
                         
          Arch throws his duffle bag on a bed, delighted. It's a private suite
          with two beds.
                         
                         ARCH
          Hey, all right... ladies, we are qonna have privacy...
                         
          He turns his collar up on his polo shirt, then eagerly pushes the two
          beds together.
                         
          The other door (to the connecting bathroom) swings open. Arch's face
          drops as Chaz walks in, lugging his gear.
                         
          ARCH (CONT.)
          You gotta be kiddin'...
                         
                         CHAZ
          (unloading his gear).
          Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't.
                         
          He blows Arch a kiss, pulling the two beds apart again.
                         
          INT. HARVEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          CLOSE UP a match flaring to life.
                         
          WIDEN TO FEVEAL Harvey lighting the cigar he took earlier out of the
          study. He puffs on it contentedly, imagining himself a man of power.
          Then he steps over to the bed and opens his suitcase to begin
          unpacking.
                         
                         HARVEY
          (to himself; rehearsing)
          Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy. I felt a
          spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other...
          in Econ 345. Why, just think of it, Muffy... with my talent and
          your... money.
                         
          He crosses to the closet with his navy blazer.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (CONTINUED)
          Why just think of it... Muffers, with my raw... driving talent and
          your...
                         
          He opens the closet door.
                         
          HARVEY (CONT.)
          ...and your...
                         
          CLOSE - HIS POV
          A newspaper PHOTOGRAPH, circled in red marker, of a garish car
          accident is pinned to the inside of the door.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         
          He puzzles, taking down the clipping, putting it down on the dresser
          as he moves there to put away his rolled socks. He opens the top
          drawer.
                         
                         POV
                         
          The same thing. Full of newspaper clippings of awful, fatal car
          crashes, all circled in the same accusatory red ink.
                         
                         RETURN ­ HARVEY
                         
          getting nervous.
                         
          Suddenly, Chaz burst in on him. Harvey turns quickly, shoving the
          clippings back in the drawer and slamming it shut.
                         
          They stare at each other for a long, uncomfortable moment.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (FINALLY)
          Wrong room.
                         
          He ducks back out the door, pulling it quietly closed behind him.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Outside Harvey's door. Chaz sighs, shakes his head, starts to move
          away when suddenly there is a LOUD BANG o.s. from inside Harvey's
          room. Chaz turns quickly back to the door, reaches for the handle,
          stops himself, thinks better of it and moves away again.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Nikki steps up to the sink in the adjoining bathroom, turns the faucet
          and is squirted by a spray of water jetting out of the rigged
          plumbing.
                         
          She quickly shuts off the water and just stands for a moment,
          dripping. trying to control her anger. Like, enough with Muffy's,
          jokes already.
                         
          She comes out of the bathroom with a towel, drying her face, and walks
          to the dresser. She strips off her shirt, pulls open the top dresser
          drawers and sees... an eyeless black rubber bondage hood and other
          miscellaneous S&M accessories.
          She picks them up in disbelief.
                         
          INT. ARCH AND CHAZ'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Arch, unloading his shaving bag, which mainly contains a 30-day supply
          of rubbers, opens the medicine cabinet. On its shelf... a kit neatly
          filled with hypodermic syringes, needles, rubber tubing, razor blades
          ...everything you could ever want for fixing.
                         
                         ARCH

          INT. FPONT STAIRCASE - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy, on her way down to straighten up, passes Rob and Kit on their
          way up.
                         
                         MUFFY

          INT. NAN'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
                         
          CLOSE ON the shower head on the bathroom gushing water.
                         
          Nan is taking a shower.
                         
          CAMERA DOLLIES BACK slowly out of the bathroom and into the bedroom.
          O.S. the shower is turned off. All is quiet.
                         
          Then, very faintly at first, WE HEAR something -- it sounds like
          crying. As it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying -- a
          baby crying.
                         
          Nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway. A towel is wrapped
          around her. She listens.
                         
          The crying is louder now, but muffled -- a baby crying for its mother.
          It seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of
          the room.
                         
          Nan tenses, slowly approaohing, then flinging open the wardrobe door.
                         
                         CLOSE ANGLE
                         
          A small cassette recorder plays. The tape runs out. The baby's cries
          stop.
          Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her
          head in her hands.
                         
          INT. ROB and KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit are standing together staring INTO CAMERA. REVERSE to see
          the object of their attention. Hanging on the wall in front of them is
          a large oil portrait with the eyes out out. Something is moving behind
          the canvas ­watching them.
                         
          Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an
          inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to
          have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-
          cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth,
          like a pendulum marking seconds.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning
          it up against the wall.
                         
          CAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much
          creepier with the now vacant eye sockets.
                         
          INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between
          them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on
          the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on
          his side.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in
          the middle of the bed.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob?
                         
          No answer.
                         
                         KIT
          You still angry with me? About dinner?
                         
                         ROB
          No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry.
                         
          He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the
          bathroom comes on. Beat.
                         
          He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in
          and turns off the light...
          ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly
          covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead
          light...
                         
          ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still
          tries to stifle it.
                         
          Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He
          reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it
          and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.
                         
                         ROB
          (burning his fingers)
          Ouch! Jesus!
                         
          Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob
          perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into
          darkness.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                         ROB
          Very funny.
                         
          Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is
          laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch
          light on for Skip.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy moves through the quiet to her room. Arch grabs her. She jumps.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (COLLECTS HERSELF)
          Arch do you know what time it is?
                         
                         ARCH
          Um-hmm.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (turning down his collar)
          Goodnight, Arch.
                         
          Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door
          behind her.
                         ARCH
                         
          Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to
          listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks
          once softly, and enters.
                         
                         HIS POV
                         
          Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's
          stare, signalling him to get the hell out.
                         
                         REVERSE
                         
          Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan.
                         
          The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also
          locked.
                         
          Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door
          for everybody's benefit.
                         
          INT. MUFFY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy, undressing, hears, and smiles.
                         
          INT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT
          Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and
          rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a
          porno movie.
                         
          Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle.
          The doorknob comes off in his hand.
                         
          He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The
          chair collapses beneath him.
                         
          EXT. BACK PATH - NIGHT
                         
          Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown
          weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He
          takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the
          night.
                         
          After a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle
          landing in water with a splash.
                         
          EXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Skip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its
          dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in
          the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp.
          Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds,
          finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph.
                         
          Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife
          to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind,
          douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse
          entrance to prepare his joint.
                         
          INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          as Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle
          lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is
          still.
                         
          Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges
          slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of
          another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing
          sound--completely inhuman.
                         
                         SKIP
          Hello?
                         
          There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping
          sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring.
                         
                         SKIP
          Who's there?
                         
          Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade
          clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear.
                         
          Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter
          and flicks it on.
                         
          Something snags him from behind.
                         
          Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed
          hands tightens around his neck.
                         
          His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.
                         
          EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          Only the porch light remains glowing. The house is dark.
                         
          INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him,
          wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking.
          Rob throws off the covers.
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Rob wraps himself with a towel, stepping quickly out to Muffy's door.
          Everything else is dark and quiet.
                         
                         ROB
          (hushed, at door)
          Muffy?
                         
          No answer. He tries her door, but it's locked tight.
                         
          A beat. Then:
                         
                         
          ROB (cont.)
                         (CONCERNED)
          Muffy?
                         
                         
                         MUFFY'S VOICE
                         (UNCERTAINLY)
          Yes?
                         
                         ROB
          You OK?
                         
                         
                         MUFFY'S VOICE
                         (DISTANTLY)
          Yes... Thank you...
                         
          He pulls back from the door.
                         
                         ROB
          (reluctantly, puzzled)
          OK... well, goodnight...
                         
          No response. He turns back for his room, catching sight of Chaz, who
          has come out of Nikki's room, to investigate, too.
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
                         
                         
          Harvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously. No
          one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and Nikki,
          naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and
          stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air.
                         
          Then she sees Harvey grinning at her. She quickly covers herself and
          pulls back inside.
          INT. KITCHEN ­ DAY
                         
          Rob and Kit are the first ones down. They enter from the dining room,
          surprising Muffy at the stove.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BRISKLY)
          Good morning!
                         
          Muffy turns abruptly, startled. Rob and Kit stop abruptly, too.
                         
                         ANGLE
                         
          Muffy is barefooted, dressed in an old, worn chenille robe.
          Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy
          about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present
          appearance, is the last way one would ever expect to find Muffy St.
          John.
                         
                         RETURN ANGLE
                         
          She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile.
          Scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I... I was hungry...
                         
          She bumps against the stove, backing away. She self-consciously runs a
          hand through her hair.
                         
          MUFFY (cont.)
          I... I must look a mess...
                         
          She scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs
          beyond, leaving the eggs to burn.
                         
          INT. BACK STAIRS ­ DAY
                         
          Arch encounters her, too, as he comes bounding down in his workout
          shorts.
                         
                         ARCH
          Morning!
          She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I... forgot to get dressed...
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Arch enters, joining his wonderment to Rob and Kit's.
                         ARCH
          Who made her night?
                         
          EXT. BACK PORCH - DAY - LATER
                         
                         CUT TO:
                         
          Arch, Chaz, Harvey and Nikki burst out the door in old clothes,
          sweats, shorts, whatever -- an unlikely foursome for some informal
          soccer scrimmaging.
                         
                         ARCH
          (always in search of more players)
          Where's Skip?
                         
                         CHAZ
          That depends on what he's on.
                         
          Rob and Kit cross their path, heading down to the water in their
          swimsuits and overshirts.
                         
                         NIKKI
          You gotta be kidding...
                         
                         ARCH
          (teasingly, an invitation)
          Nan? What about it?
                         
          Nan watches from the porch, book in hand.
                         
                         NAN
          Oh, no, thanks.
                         (FALSELY)
          Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do...
                         
          Arch shrugs and the soccer free-for-all begins in earnest, with
          special attention given to the interplay between Harvey and Nikki.
                         
          Up on the porch, Nan finally sees Muffy emerging from the distant tool
          shed. Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible
          sense of disorder about her. She keeps to herself, turning toward the
          woods beyond, with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand.
                         
          Nan puts down her book, hurrying off the porch. But by the timeshe
          looks up again, Muffy is gone...
          EXT. DOCK - DAY
                         
          Rob and Kit are standing together on the dock. He is dripping wet and
          covered with goose flesh. She has not been in yet. And while he is
          vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood
          circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and
          gently, lovingly dries his back. She finishes and he steps away from
          her and gazes out across the sound.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob? What's wrong?
                         
          Pause.
                         
                         ROB
          I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday .
                         
          This isn't what she meant, and he knows it.
                         
                         KIT
          Are you giving up?
                         
                         ROB
          (turning to her; gently)
          What about you? What about your future? You're the one with the four
          point.
                          (DEJECTED)
          ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me.
                         
                         KIT
                         (QUIETLY)
          I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and
          everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school.
                         
                         ROB
                         (PROTESTING)
          You've got a great mind
                         
                         KIT
          ...only it's not made up.
                         
          Smiling sadly, he crosses to her, puts his arms around her.
                         
                         ROB
          Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are?
                         
                         KIT
          It's made up about one thing though.
                         
                         ROB
          Yeah? What's that?
          She looks up and kisses him softly.
                         
                         ROB
          Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years
          from now?
                         
          She takes his hand and leads him down the pier and into the boathouse.
                         
                         
          INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY
          As they come inside. Kit closes the door, and immediately they are in
          each other's arms.
                         
          The surging waves swirl beneath them, visible through the shrunken
          floorboards. Rob and Kit stretch out. All the passion, all the
          tenderness, all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that
          something is moving on the water below...
                         
          And when Kit finally opens her eyes to it, Skip's face bulges
          gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor!
                         
          Kit screams and scrambles to her feet--Rob completely uncomprehending
          until he sees it too: Skip's body, pale and bloodied, draped within
          the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the waves.
                         
          EXT. DOCK - DAY
                         
          By the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out
          with Kit, however, Rob's shock has turned to rage.
                         
                         ROB
          Skip! You sonofabitch!
                         
          But there's no response, Skip's body unmoving on the self-powered
          skiff which continues bobbing out to sea.
                         
                         ROB
                         
          starts to wonder whether it really is a joke. He hurries forward,
          plunging 'into the water to reach the boat.
                         
                         ROB
          Skip... Skip!
                         
          But it's too far and getting farther, and the waves are too strong.
                         
          EXT. ST. JOHN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Rob and Kit come struggling up the path. Chaz trains his videopak on
          them from the porch . He, Arch, Harvey and Nikki unwind with beer and
          sandwiches after their sweaty workout.
                         CHAZ
          (commentary while he tapes)
          Respectable young Quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of
          nonviolent sex.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (CALLING )
          Well, how was it?
                         
                         ROB
          Where's Skip? Anybody seen him?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Who wants to know?
                         
                         ROB
          Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer!
                         
          They sit up with the force. Nan comes out on the porch, hearing .
                         
                         KIT
                         (FRANTICALLY)
          We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He
          looked dead... unless he was joking...!
                         
                         CHAZ
          Well, if it was Skip...
                         
                         KIT
          I saw his face!
                         
                         ROB
                         (DEMANDINGLY)
          Has anybody seen him since last night?
                         
          They all realize they haven't.
                         
          ROB (cont .)
          Jesus Christ...
                         
          Rob turns, rushing into the house.
                         
          INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
                         
          Rob stops as he notices, near the foot of the stairs where he'd parked
          it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon, Skip's overnight
          bag.
                         
          He turns and bounds up the stairs.
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Rob runs down to Skip's door and flings it open. A cheap rubber
          hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him, suspended from the ceiling
          on frail, metal springs.
                         
          Rob jumps back with a startled cry, then angrily tears the thing out
          of his way and throws it down.
                         
          This is the last of Muffy's little April Fool's gags, and as with the
          overnight bag, it signifies that Skip has been nowhere near this room.
                         
          But Rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure.
                         
          The room is untouched, the bed unslept in.
                         
          EXT . PORCH - DAY
                         
          Rob hurries out, as Muffy finally appears, emerging from the wooded
          grounds, basketful of mushrooms in hand. She approaches.

          (noticing their distress )
          Something wrong?
                         
          Rob rushes by her.
                         
                         ARCH
          Wait! I'll go with you!
                         
                         CHAZ
          Me too!
                         
          EXT. DOCK - DAY
                         
          As Rob, Arch and Chaz come running down to the water. They stop and
          look around, seeing nothing.
                         
          No answer.
                         
                         ARCH
          (aloud: for Skip)
          Hey, asshole!
                         
                         CHAZ
          Wait a minute! Look at this!
                         
          He has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock, Skip's
          switchblade. It is in pieces. There's blood on the broken blade.
                         
                         CHAZ
          This was Skip's.
                         ARCH
          What do you think? That guy on the ferry?
                         
                         ROB
          I don't know. I don't know what to think.
                         
                         ARCH
          I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still
          be around... somewhere.
                         
                         CHAZ
          You mean split up?
                         
                         ROB
          Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big.
                         
                         ARCH
          No sucker's taken me yet.
                         
          He rips a loose board off the dock for a club.
                         
          EXT. UTILITY ROOM - HOUSE ­ DAY
                         
          In the gathering twilight, Muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on
          a shelf. Someone grabs her wrist. She gasps. It's Nan. Nan steps from
          the shadows.
                         
                         NAN
          I know why you're avoiding me...
                         (DISTRAUGHT)
          I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd
          you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you
          told?... Who else knows, except the father!
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (ASTONISHED)
          I... don't know what you're talking about.
                         
                         NAN
          Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion!
                         
          She comes apart, in tears. Muffy stares, uncomprehending.
                         
          NAN (cont.)
          I thought you wanted to be friends... you think you can play with
          people's feelings just because you're rich and can do what you want.
          Well, you can't...!
                         
          She rushes out the rear door. Muffy tries to recover, confused.
                         
          She continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen.
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Swinging open the door, she almost runs into Harvey.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (SHEEPISHLY)
          Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right.
                         
          He beats a hasty retreat the other way, passing Nikki on her way in
          Nikki raises an eyebrow at Muffy, misinterpreting the tension in the
          air.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Harvey? No kidding'?
                         
          Maybe that explains your clothes.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (NERVOUSLY)
          What d'you, mean?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Oh, c'mon.
                         
          Muffy exits hurriedly, upset.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - DAY
                         
          The path is narrow and tortuous . Arch uses his club to clear the way,
          trying to follow its twists and turns. He also tries to make vocal
          contact.
                         
                         ARCH
          Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip!
                         
          He moves deeper and deeper into the forest.
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         
          Up ahead on the pathway a thick, black viper slithers out of the
          undergrowth, stops, sensing Arch's presence, and coils itself against
          his approach.
                         
                         WIDER
                         
          as Arch stalks forward, not looking at the ground.
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         ARCH
                         (THUNDERING )
          Skip!
                         
          Arch steps right over the snake and continues on.
                         
                         WIDER
                         
          as Arch hears a noise. He stops. SOMEONE ELSE is here with him, very
          nearby.
                         
                         ARCH
          Skip?
                         
          He turns and moves back along the trail, peering into the dense
          foliage on either side.
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         
          as he steps over the snake again going back the other way.
                         
                         WIDER
                         
          He stops again, looks all around him, then turns once more and starts
          to move very slowly with short little steps back in the other
          direction.
                         
                         ARCH
          Skip?
                         
                         LOW ANGLE
                         
          He is edging closer and closer to the snake. He is bound to step on it
          this time.
                         
          The snake coils itself to strike.
                         
          Arch's foot comes down just missing it, less than six inches away,
          when suddenly the ground seems to move. A noose springs up, tightens
          around his ankle, and Arch is lifted into the air upside down,
          swinging wildly, dropping his club.
                         
          Now the viper strikes, and Arch sees it. He is shrieking with horror
          as he tries to bat the creature away from him. But he keeps swinging
          into it, and the snake keeps striking at him, trying to find an
          opening.
                         
          Suddenly a long, gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the snake in
          two.
                         
          Arch looks up, his face white and frozen into a mask of sheer terror,
          no longer able even to scream
          EXT. BACK YARD - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Kit, Nikki and Harvey are waiting on the back porch when Rob emerges
          from the woods nearby.
                         
                         KIT
          (calling to him)
          No Skip?
                         
          Chaz now comes out of the woods on the other side of the yard.
                         
                         CHAZ
          No luck.
                         
                         ROB
                         (TO CHAZ)
          Where's Arch?
                         
                         CHAZ
          He isn't with you?
                         
                         NIKKI
          I don't like this... I definitely don't think I like this...
                         
                         KIT
          I think it's about time we called the police.
                         
          The screen door BANGS again. They look up. It's Muffy. She returns
          their stares stiffly, without expression . She holds flowers cut with
          hand shears.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Eight-two-four-eight. Constable Potter has an office at his home.
                         
                         KIT
                         (TO ROB)
          I don't think we should wait any longer...
                         
          Rob moves into the house past Muffy. Kit follows him.
                         
          MUFFY (to be played like Muffy)
          Who wants some tea?
                         (BEAT)
          It'll calm our nerves...
                         
          She exits toward the kitchen . Nikki. perplexed by her behavior, looks
          strangely after her.
                         
          EXT . GROUNDS OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          Nan sits alone on a stone bench beside a small Buddha statue in a
          secluded corner of the garden behind the house. She has been weeping.
          Her face tells the story.
                         
          Now a gentle wind springs up rustling the leaves of the thick bushes
          surrounding her. She looks up.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM ­ SUNSET
                         
          Rob is on the phone trying to reach the Constable. He hangs up the
          receiver, then lifts it and starts to· dial again. Kit, standing
          beside him. now wanders silently off into the dining room .
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE - SUNSET
                         
          As Kit enters, Muffy comes in from the pantry, breathless and
          apologetic, her hands full of tea boxes.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I didn't know what kind anybody would like so I just... got them
          all...
                         
                         KIT
          Let me help.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (CAREFULLY)
          Has he reached the Constable?
                         
                         KIT
          Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet.
                         
          Muffy eases. Kit turns the tap to fill the kettle. The pipes begin to
          BANG. The tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before
          running dry.
                         
                         L1UFFY
          Oh... ·the main... it's probably broken.
                         
                         KIT
                         (STUNNED)
          No water?
                         
          Nikki and Harvey enter, having heard the pipes banging.
                         
                         NIKKI
          What's happening.
                         
                         KIT
          No water.
                         NIKKI
          What!
                         
                         MUFFY
          It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes
          have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies.
                         
          Nikki reaches for a large flashlight beam.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (GALLANTLY)
          Not without me.
                         
          Harvey accompanies Nikki out the back door, leaving Kit and Muffy
          alone again.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (bearing up under Kit's stare)
          I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up
          to some kind of stupid trick . . .
                         
          Kit moves out of the kitchen uneasily.
                         
          EXT. WELL - DUSK
          Nikki milkes ghost sound8, following Harvey out through the dark. It
          makes him nervous.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (UNCOMFORTABLY)
          I don't think you should really do that.
                         
                         NIKKI
                          (SEEING)
          Is that it?
                         
          The well is the old-fashioned kind.
                         
          NIKKI (cont.)
          Boy, when she said `well,' she really meant 'well'. who dug this
          thing? Pocahontas?
                         
          She reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick
          rope. Harvey pre-empts.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you.
                         
                         NIKKI
          You mean, back home on the farm?
                         HARVEY
          I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about
          that, if you'd only give me the chance.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Why?
                         
                         HARVEY
          Because, I'd really like to plow your field.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (SMILES" IMPRESSED)
          Draw me some water.
                         
          He's glad to oblige, opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering
          the bucket slowly. The dark hole seems to go on forever. Suddenly,
          there's a muffled CLATTER deep within the well.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Aw, crap...
                         
                         NIKKI
          What happened?
                         
                         HARVEY
          I lost the bucket.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Harve.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that.
                         
                         NIKKI
          You didn't.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it.
                         
          She rises on her toes, flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole.
          Harvey bends over to look. A rotted piece of the well cover breaks off
          in his hand. He lurches forward.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Oh... oh, Jesus!
                         
          He slams back in ashen horror.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (STARTLED}

                         HARVEY
          Stay back! Don't look!
                         
                         NIKKI
          I'm a big girl now. I think I ·can handle a few spiders and
                         FROGS ---
                         
          She shines the beam down again, bending in for a look.
                         
                         HARVEY
                         NIKKI --
                         
          She should've listened to him.
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          Nan's body lies twisted and jammed among the slime. Her dress is torn,
          revealing a white breast with veins of blood streaming across it and
          into the water. Next to her, Arch's severed head gapes up in a rictus
          grin, joined in its leer by Skip's decapitated head.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         
          It's like the very guts have been torn out of her. She screams,
          stumbling back.

          In the well ! Oh, God, the well!
                         
          Rob grabs the flashlight from Chaz's hands and leaps up to take a
          look.
                         
          After a long, horrifying glimpse he has to step back to control his
          overwhelming nausea. He shudders violently.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (COLD FEAR)

          We can't get away. Everyone back into the house . Now.

          Looking in through the windows we can see Rob alone in the living room
          still trying the phone.
                         
          PANNING ACROSS to the dining room windows, we see Nikki seated at the
          table with Kit and Chaz on either side of her. Harvey stands behind
          them against the wall.

          Kit is trying to comfort Nikki who is still in shock.
                         
                         KIT
          It's okay, Nikki. With the others... they were outdoors. But we're
          inside now, and we're safe.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (QUIETLY)
          It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it?
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (HIMSELF UNNERVED)
          It was an accident. Don't they know that?
                         
          Muffy enters from the kitchen with a glass of water. Harvey pulls her
          quietly aside.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Muffy, where do you keep your guns?
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (BLANKLY)
          Guns? We don't keep guns in this house.
                         
          The others turn and look back at them. There is an uncomfortable
          pause.
                         
                         MUFFY
          (handing Nikki the glass)
          Here.

          Oh, God! Not the water!
                         MUFFY
          It's all right. It's Perrier.
                         
          Suddenly the phone rings O. S. They all look toward the living room.

          He listens for a moment, then almost collapses with relief.
                         
          ROB (cont.)
          Constable Potter... Thank God it's you...

          He listens for a moment, then ...

          came out of surgery last night--It might interest you to know he'll be
          all right-- and Cal's been here too, the whole time.

          He looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly.
                         ROB
                         (FINALLY)
          Yes, all right... Please... Please hurry.
                         
          He hangs up. Pause.
                         
                         ROB
          (anything, but jubilant)
          He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together...
                         
                         CHAZ
          What about the ferryman?
                         
                         ROB
          It isn't him. They've been together all day.

          I don't understand.
                         
          They look at each other ominously.
                         
                         ROB
                         (STANDING)

          He's going to send up a flare as he's nearing the dock. Then
          we're to go down as a group to meet him there.
                         (MOVING AWAY)
          In the meantime... we just wait.

          Kit enters, checks and locks the windows. She turns on the lamp. On
          the desk -- prominently displayed and catching her eye -- a FRAMED
          PHOTOGRAPH.
          CLOSE - THE PHOTOGRAPH
                         
          It is a black-and-white picture, probably Muffy as a child. But
          what's confusing is there's another little girl next to her in the
          picture, who looks just like Muffy, too...
                         
                         KIT

          Muffy enters suddenly, interrupting her. Kit startles, turning. They
          face each other.

                         MUFFY
          Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all
          night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they

          reaches in and pulls out a small revolver. He drops the cylinder,
          checking to see that it's loaded, then snaps it back in place. He
          tucks the weapon into the waistband at the small of his back, then
          slips on his navy blazer.

          all stir.
                         
                         HARVEY
          She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob... before you
          came back alone.
                         
          They turn full attention on him.
                         
                         HARVEY
          About something Nan found in her room.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What?
                         HARVEY
                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Something about an abortion.
                         
          They all pause.
                         
                         NIKKI
          I found somethin"g in my room, too
                         
          She reaches into her bag and pulls out the black rubber bondage hood.
                         
                         NIKKI
          ...only I don't think it was intended for me .
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (SARCASTIC )
          Oh, really?
                         
                         HARVEY
          (to Chaz; defending Nikki)
          And What did you find?
                         
                         CHAZ
          I didn't find anything.
                         
                         HARVEY
          We're supposed to believe that?
                         
                         CHAZ
          That's right.
                         (TRUMPING HIM)
          I spent the night with Nikki.
                         (BEAT)
          What about you?
                         
                         HARVEY
          What about me?
                         
                         CHAZ
          What's your little secret?
                         
                         HARVEY
                         (EVASIVELY)
          I don't know What you're talking about.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Oh, come on, sport. I walked in on you last night , and you were
          acting like your ass was on fire...
                         
                         HARVEY
          It wasn't anything... Just some clippings... of some car accidents.
                         CHAZ
                         (INSINUATING)
          Nothing personal in that, I suppose?
                         
                         HARVEY
          No! Who hasn't been in a car accident? It's a common thing.
                         
                         CHAZ
          I haven't.
                         
          There is a slight pause. Rob comes into the living room, holding a
          flashlight and stands just inside the doorway.
                         
          The others shift uncomfortably.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (QUIETLY)
          What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these
          things and why -- ?

          What is wrong with us? Nhat happened to all our talk about friendship,
          and undying loyalty?
          (looking from one to the other)
          Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here
          discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited
          us all here to --
                         
          She stops suddenly, freezing in mid-sentence, and they all turn,
          following the direction of her look, to see Muffy standing in the
          entryway behind Rob.
                         
                         MUFFY
          I'm going upstairs.
                         
                         ROB
          Muffy? We should all stay together.
                         
                         MUFFY
          This is my house.

          I'll be in my room.
                         
          She turns and heads up the stairs.
                         
          Pause.
                         NIKKI
                         (FINALLY)
          She's got a point.
                         (STANDING)
          We're starting to get on each other's nerves.
                         
                         HARVEY
          As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other...
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (TO CHAZ)
          You coming?
                         
          He joins her, and they quietly head for the stairs.
                         
                         ROB
          I'm goinq to find the way up to the attic.
                         
                         KIT
          Why?
                         
                         ROB
          I'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there.
                         
          Kit hesitates.
                         
                         HARVEY
          It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs.
                         
          Rob ho1ds out his hand to her. She takes it and they walk together
          toward the stairs.
                         
          INT. MUFFY' S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy enters, closes the door quietly and locks it behind her. She
          crosses to her bed, slowly sits down and loses herself in troubled
          thought about everything that is going on.
                         
          INT. MAIN STAIRWAY ­ NIGHT
                         
          Harvey steps up to the halfway landing and sits down. He looks above,
          looks below, then opens a magazine and begins thumbing through it.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Nikki's suitcase is open on the bed, and she is moving nervously about
          the room, gathering her things and cramming them into it.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Nikki, come on...
                         NIKKI
          What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki,
          come on.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What are you doing?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But
          once I leave this place, I'm never coming back.
                         
          She walks out the door, and Chaz follows her to...
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          They cross the hall.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (catching up to her)
          We're all supposed to stay together here.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Yeah, that's been real effective...
                         
          She goes into...
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - SAME
                         
          ...and starts to collect all her stuff from in here. Chaz comes in
          behind her.
                         
                         CHAZ
          So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By
          yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner
          to happen by and pick you up. Is that it?
                         
          NIKKI,
          (pushing past him)
          I can't stay here any longer.
                         
          She goes back out into the hallway. Chaz follows.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          as they cross back to Nikki's bedroom.
                         
                         CHAZ
          What if the Constable never even comes?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if
          I have to.
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          as they re-enter.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Look, just relax--
                         
                         NIKKI
          Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax?
                         CHAZ
          Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me.
                         
          She stops and looks at him.
                         
          CHAZ (CONT.)
          Now, am I nervous? Yes. Maybe even a little bit scared? Yes.
          Am I running around like a chicken with its head cut off?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Nice image.
                         
                         CHAZ
          No.

          I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh?
                         
          He quickly slips the S&M mask over his head, clowning around.
                         
          CHAZ (CONT.)
                         (MUFFLED)
          Look at this. What, me worry?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Very funny, Chaz.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all
          right... Huh? Huh?
                         
                         NIKKI
          Don't be a jerk.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right?
                         
          NIKKI,
          Take that thing off.
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Why? I kind of like it in here.
          (moving blindly toward her)
          Kiss me, you savage she-devil.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Get out of here.
                         
          She pushes him and he falls backward across the bed.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Ooooh, stop it some more. I love it when you're rough.
                         
          She turns and goes out of the room again. Chaz remains lying across
          the bed.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (MUFFLED)
          Course it would help a little if I could breathe in here. For when
          things start to get really passionate.
                         (BEAT)
          Nikki?
                         
          CAMERA FRAMES the open bedroom window for a beat. The curtains luff
          slightly in response to a gentle breeze wafting in.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Nikki comes down the hall with some more clothes on her arm. She
          arrives at her door, opens it (she had not closed it the last time she
          went out), and goes inside.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - SAME
          Chaz is still lying across the bed as last seen, except that now his
          hands cover his crotch.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (NOTICING)
          Real subtle, Chaz.
                         
          She continues packing, moving around the room.
                         
          NIKKI (CONT.)
          Now I'm supposed to throw off my clothes and jump on you? Just wind
          her up and watch her go? You've got a lot to learn, buddy.
                         
          No response. Chaz lies perfectly still. Not even his chest appears to
          be moving.
                         NIKKI
          (looking at his crotch again)
          What is this? Show and tell?
                         (BEAT)
          I'll show you mine if you show me yours?
                         (BEAT)
          Well, forget it... You may as well just stick it back in your pants.

          Chaz?... Chaz?
                         (NO ANSWER)
          Say something, goddammit!
                         
          She swats his hands away from his crotch. Beneath them, on his pants,
          is a slowly growing blood stain.
                         
          Nikki gasps, her mouth contorting into a scream that will not come.
          She turns suddenly in response to .a NOISE O.S., and sees a DARK
          FIGURE stepping out from behind the slowly closing bedroom door.
                         
          INT . ATTIC STAIRS - NIGHT
                         
          It is almost pitch black. O.S. there is the sound of a lightswitch
          being flicked on and off.
                         
          ROB (O.S.)
          No lights.
                         
          Suddenly a flashlight beam pierces the darkness, and Rob and Kit can
          now be seen ascending the stairs to the attic.
                         
          INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
                         
          ...as they arrive at the top. Rob sweeps the one large room with her
          flashlight. Piles of old furniture are stacked here and there, covered
          with grimy sheets.
                         
                         KIT
          No one's been up here in years.
                         
          Rob crosses to the garret windows overlooking the sound.
                         
          PAUSE.
                         
                         KIT
          Can you see him?
                         
                         ROB
          NO. There must not be a light on the boat.
                         
                         KIT
          Or... he's chosen not to use it.
                         ROB
          Kit? He said something else on the phone, about Muffy.
                         
                         KIT
          What?
                         
                         ROB
          He said not to trust anybody. That's why we were to stay together. No
          one was to be left alone with anyone else... Then he said, especially
          not with Muffy.
                         
                         KIT
          So that's why you let her go upstairs?
                         
                         ROB
          That's why I let her go.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BEAT)
          What did he mean by that?
                         
                         ROB
          I don't know. He wouldn't explain it.
                         
                         KIT
          But that's ridiculous...
                         
                         ROB
          Is it? He's known her longer than we have.
                         
          He sweeps the flashlight back toward the stairs.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, wait a minute. What's that?
                         
                         ROB
          Where?
                         
          She takes the flashlight from him and aims it on something near the
          door--the Barbie and Ken dolls from the previous night's dinner.
                         
                         ROB
          It's just the dolls.
                         
                         KIT
          She's been up here.
                         
                         ROB
          So?
          She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As
          she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not
          just been stuck there haphazardly.
                         
                         KIT
                         (ALARMED)
          Rob?
                         
          Rob comes over to join her as we CUT TO:
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them, slowly revealing
          them one by one. The last to be seen are a Barbie and the heads of two
          Kens stuck in a bowl of water.
                         
          ROB AND KlT
                         
          staring at them, frightened and astonished.
                         
                         ROB
          Jesus...
                         
                         KIT
                         (LOSING IT)
          Rob? . . .
                         
                         ROB
          It's Arch and Skip and Nan.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob??...
                         
                         ROB
          Wait...
                         
          He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a
          Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them
          splattered with bright red nail polish.
                         
                         ROB
          What are these other two?
                         
          Suddenly the room is flooded with light. Rob turns sharply and sees
          outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky.
                         
                         ROB
          He's here!
                         
          O.S. there is a PISTOL SHOT from downstairs. Kit screams.
                         ROB
          Come on!
                         
          He jumps to his feet, grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him
          out of the attic.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
                         
          as they come racing down from the attic. Rob heads for the
          main staircase...
                         
                         ROB
          Hal!
                         
          ...while Kit runs down the hall to Nikki's room and flings
          open the door.
                         
                         KIT
          Nikki?
                         
          She isn't there.
                         
          Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving
          about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening.
                         
          She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps
          inside.
                         
          INT. CHAZ' ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          It is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating. Kit
          closes the door behind her and leans forward, barely whispering...
                         
                         KIT
          Chaz?... Nikki?...
                         
          She turns on the light and sees the bed, both beds: they are drenched
          in blood.
                         
          Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob!!!
                         
          She's frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob
          back in, to get it to work.
                         
          There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the
          door flies open.
                         ROB
                         (ENTERING)
          I can't find Hal--
                         
          He stops in mid-sentence as he sees the beds. Kit is already through
          the door. Rob follows her out.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALL . - NIGHT
                         
          Rob is running with her toward the stairs.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, what about Muffy?
                         
                         ROB
          Forget her!
                         
                         KIT
                         (STOPPING HIM)
          She's my friend!
                         
          She breaks away from him and dashes down to Muffy's door. Rob has no
          choice but to follow her.
                         
                         KIT
                         (KNOCKING)
          Muffy! Muffy!!
                         
          She tries the door, but it's locked.
                         
                         ROB
          (pulling her away)
          Let's go.
                         
          Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps
          into something, someone there. He screams aloud, dropping his
          flashlight.
                         
          It is Harvey. His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of
          the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck.
                         
          Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead.
                         
                         KIT
          This way!
                         
          And they head back toward the main staircase.
          EXT DOCK. -- NIGHT
                         
          The flarelight wanes. Constable Potter looks up anxiously. Soon he
          will be waiting in darkness . (Unlike the previous night's scene, now
          there are no outdoor lights on here.)
                         
          EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire.
          Kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them.
                         
                         ROB
          (yanking her away)
          Forget the doors!
                         
          Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into
          the brush leading down to the water.
                         
          EXT. PATHWAYS - NIGHT
                         
          The night is a landscape of terror. As Rob and Kit race through the
          darkness, the forest seems to fold in on top of them, completely
          enclosing them within itself.
                         
          EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
                         
          They arrive at the water's edge and slow down abruptly. Though they
          can see Potter's boat rocking gently in the water, moored to the dock,
          they cannot make out any sign of the Constable.
                         
                         ROB
          (in guarded approach)
          Constable... Mr. Potter?
                         
          No answer. The silence is chilling. They proceed out onto the dock.
          They come to the boat.
                         
                         ROB
                         (WHISPERING)
          If there's another flare, we can signal him.
                         
                         KIT
          Maybe he went on to the house.
                         
          Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat
          in. It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in.
          Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface.
                         
                         CLOSE ANGLE
                         
          It is Constable Potter, his body turning once before sinking again
          under its tethered weights.
          An animal cries out behind them. Rob wastes no more time, pulling the
          rope and the boat quickly toward them. They jump in.
                         
          There is a flashlight in the toolbox. Rob grabs it, shining it onto
          the controls. But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to
          start it.
                         
                         ROB
          Shit... no key!
                         
          Kit, meanwhile, picks up the LETTER that's lying on the bottom of the
          boat.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob!
                         
          He turns.
                         
          KIT (cont.)
          Look!
                         
          She presses it into his hands. He shines the flashlight.
                         
                         CLOSER ANGLE
                         
          Its waterstained, but still legible... The letterhead reads, 'STATE
          HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE,' and it is dated 'MARCH 31,'
          addressed to Potter, and reads:
                         
                         RETURN ANGLE
                         
                         ROB
          "...Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the
          patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to
          custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in
          your jurisdiction. If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify
          us immediately, as Miss St. John has ·been a patient here for three
          years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely
          dangerous..."
                         
          Kit looks up, frantic.
                         
                         KIT
          Miss .St. John? What's it talking about? Muffy hasn't been in any
          state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at
          Vassar!
                         
                         ROB
          I don't know... but we've gotta get this boat started.
                         KIT
          How?
                         
                         ROB
          The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen?
                         
                         KIT
                         (IN DREAD)
          Oh, no...
                         
                         ROB
          We've got no choice.
                         
                         KIT
          I know.

          Shit.
                         
                         PAUSE
                         
                         KIT
          Rob?
                         
                         ROB
          Huh?
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, I really don't want to go back there.
                         
                         ROB
          I know.
                         
                         KIT
          Shit.
                         
          Another pause. Neither one is making the move to go.
                         
                         ROB
          I'd have you stay here, but--
                         
                         KIT
          No.
                         
                         ROB
                         (BEAT)
          Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through
          so much together...
                         
          She has started to cry softly.
          ROB (cont.)
          ...it isn't going to end here.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BEING BRAVE)
          Okay.
                         
          He kisses her. Pause.
                         
                         ROB
          Well...
                         
                         KIT
          Yeah...
                         
                         ROB
          Let's go.
                         
                         KIT
          Let's go.
                         
                         ROB
          Let's go.
                         
          Brief pause, then he turns to go.
                         
                         ROB
          Shit...
                         
          They move slowly off the dock.
                         
          EXT. GROUNDS OF HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze
          across at the house. It is completely dark within and remains wrapped
          in silence as before.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed.
                         
          Sure enough, the doors they come out by minutes ago, the ones they
          didn't stop to close, are now shut tight.
                         
                         ROB
          Come on.
                         
          They move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the
          house. They stop.
                         
                         ROB
          There.
          He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot
          space of clear lawn.
                         
                         ROB
          That's how we're going in.
                         
          Kit swallows hard.
                         
          She nods.
                         
                         ROB
          Are you with me?
                         
          They break from their cover and run, keeping low, to the side of the
          house. Rob peers through the window into the darkness inside , pushes
          the transom all the way open, and then drags himself through on his
          belly.
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          He drops to the floor, turning to give Kit a hand. She enters the
          same, dusting herself off next to him. Rob turns on the flashlight,
          using it cautiously.
                         
                         ROB
          (moving through darkness)
          The stairs... Where are the stairs?...
                         
                         KIT
          What's that?
                         
          They pause, hearing
                         
          DRIPPING SOUNDS in the darkness , comi ng from the depths of the
          utility room.
                         
          Rob leads the way, cautiously, toward the sound.
                         
          INT . UTILITY ROOM
                         
          The flashlight cuts through the dark, revealing the tap DRIPPING in
          the tub.
                         
          Before, the tub was clean. NOW, however, stubborn crimson STAINS smear
          the basin, like blood that has refused to be washed away. Other stains
          darken the floor.
                         
                         REVERSE ANGLE
                         
          Kit's eyes widen in growing horrow. Rob turns the beam toward the
          stains that track across the floor, following them.
                         KIT
                         (FEARFULLY)

          INT. BASEMENT
                         
          The trail leads out of the utility room to the large, cast-iron
          incinerator. Rob steps forward, slowly opening its door, angling the
          beam inside.
                         
          THEIR POV - INCINERATOR
                         
          Inside, Muffy's characteristic attire -- the clothes we saw her
          wearing yesterday after their arrival -- lie stuffed inside, bloodied
          and charred.
                         
                         KIT
          Muffy's clothes...

                         (PUZZLED)
          I don't get it.
                         
          The beam momentarily sweeps the wall next to Kit. She sees something.
                         
                         KIT
          (an urgent whisper)
          Rob!
                         
          She gets him to turn the beam back to the wall where she is. She helps
          train it on what she saw.
                         
          POV - THE WALL
                         
          It is a growth ·chart that has been marked in ink faded over the
          years. There are growth measurements for 'MUFFY'... and for ·a child
          named 'BUFFY"... with similar heights on similar dates.
                         
          RETURN ON KIT
                         
          She gasps, finally connecting it.
                         
                         KIT
          Oh, god... oh no!...
                         
          He doesn't yet understand.

          ...the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the
          Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin
          sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister!
          Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else.

          Rob?
                         
          She follows his look and sees, on the wall near the growth chart, that
          he has trained his flashlight beam on the eyeless portrait from the
          night before. Only now, there are REAL EYES BEHIND THE PAINTING,
          STARING OUT AT THEM.

          He casts about for a weapon, coming up with a length of lead pipe.
                         
                         ROB
          Pull it away...

                         ROB
          Pull it away!
                         
          They advance together on the painting, Rob keeping his flashlight on
          the eyes the entire time. Kit slowly reaces out, lifts the painting
          from the wall and drops it, jumping back... just as MUFFY'S HEAD rolls
          forward from a shelf behind the painting, right into Kit's lap!
                         
          Kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato,
          trying to get rid of it.
                         
          Suddenly a loud NOISE slams at the basement window. Rob grabs Kit,
          covering her mouth and snapping off .the flashlight. The head falls to
          the. floor at their feet. They turn...

          ...just in time to see the window they entered being nailed shut from
          the outside. All else they can make out are Buffy's hands and her
          tell-tale nurse shoes. Then these two move of sight around the outside
          of the house.
                         
                         BASEMENT
                         
          Rob clicks on the beam in the direction they went and sees the stairs.
          They race to them, up them, the door to the pantry is not locked. It
          gives way under Rob's pressure.
                         
          INT. PANTRY ­ NIGHT
                         
          Kit scrambles up behind him. They can hear Buffy outside in the yard
          APPROACHING the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit hurry in. Rob searches frantically for the key board.
                         
                         ROB
          The boat key... it's gotta be here...
                         
          His flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves. Suddenly, Buffy is at the
          kitchen door. Though the door in locked, there's no bolt or chain to
          fully secure it. The knob RATTLES furiously under Buffy's grip, the
          door SHUDDERS.
                         
          Rob spots a walk-in cupboard. He hurries to it. Kit gropes along the
          shelves, searching the objects hanging along the distant wall.
                         
                         KITCHEN DOOR
                         
          A long, ugly-looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the
          door. Buffy is using it to try to pry open the door.

          Rob opens the door. Success. His beam falls on the key board on the
          inner wall.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit... I
                         
          He steps in, following his beam into the darkness. The cupboard door
          SLAMS shut behind him. He turns, trapped.

          The shadowed figure of BUFFY, barefooted, disheveled, in a smock,

          He is kicking the door, hurling himself at the door, but all to no
          effect. He barely has room to maneuver.

          Kit turns to Rob's voice, takes a step toward the cupboard, but
          suddenly Buffy is there, cutting her off.
                         
          Kit backes away, into the dining room.

          Kit reels back under Buffy's steady advance. Kit can't see her clearly
          in the dim light, but she can make out, beneath Buffy's wild, stringy,
          dangling hair, the madness, the likeness of Muffy -- the familiar face
          somehow twisted by hate and madness into a stiff, hideous, unnatural
          deformation.
                         
          Buffy closes in, readying the long, greedy knife.

          that lead to the living room.
                         KIT
          Buffy?... please, we didn't mean any harm... we're leaving... we just

                         ROB
          (for all he's worth)
          Kit! I love you! I love you, Kit!
                         
          A man's HAND reaches out from the side, lightly touching Rob's
          shoulder. Rob jumps, turning.
                         
                         ANGLE
                         
          It is Buck, standing practically right beside him, staring at Rob. His
          face is the same bloody, hideous mess it was the day before, after the
          accident.
                         
          Rob screams.
                         
                         BUCK
          I love you too, babe.
                         
          Rob swings at him, but only succeeds in smashing his knuckles against
          the door.
                         
          Buck grabs him and violently plants a kiss on his cheek.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM
                         
          Kit slams back against the double doors, nowhere to go.
                         
                         KIT
          No... Oh, God...
                         
          and Buffy strikes. The knife jabs into the door, close to Kit's head.
          Kit gasps, momentarily spared. She pushes apart the double doors and
          stumbles back into...
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM
                         
          All the lights are on, and when Kit takes her eyes off Buffy long
          enough to find out why, she discovers everyone is here -- Skip, Chaz,
          Nikki, Arch, Harvey, Nan, even the Constable and the ferryman. They
          sit or casually stand, quietly talking or reading magazines, taking no
          notice of her whatsoever.
          INT. CUPBOARD
                         
          Rob is screaming uncontrollably. Buck calmly peels all the blood and
          gore right off his face and slaps in onto Rob. Rob keeps screaming.
          Then Buck reaches out and unlatches the door. It was right there the
          whole time.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM
                         
          Kit is totally bewildered...
                         
                         KIT
                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          What.... ?
                         
          Then she looks back at Buffy who steps into the living room, and
          smiling, holds up the knife and plunges it into her own hand. The
          blade is retractable.
                         
                         KIT
          (wrought with emotion)
          Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!!
                         
          Suddenly everyone in the room comes to life, roaring with laughter.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN
                         
          Rob stumbles out of the cupboard, Buck's gory make-up still stuck to
          his face.
                         
                         ROB
          Kit! !
                         
          Still frightened and confused, Rob hasn't put it together yet. He runs
          out of the kitchen...
                         
          INT LIVING ROOM
                         
          ...through the dining room and into the living room where he stops
          dead cold upon seeing everybody.
                         
                         
                         ROB
          Ki--!
                         
          The group laughs louder at the sight of him. Buck walks up behind Rob
          and claps him on the shoulder. Rob jumps and screams involuntarily.
          The group laughs louder still...
          INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Muffy is wiping off the last of her "Buffy" make-up.
                         
                         MUFFY
          You guys are really terrific. I love you all. And I thank you from
          the bottom of my heart for being such good sports.
                         
                         ROB
                         (STILL SHAKEN)
          Oh, sure. Quite welcome. Any time.
                         
          He sits, or rather lands, on the sofa next to Kit.
                         
          Laughter.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best. You figured it all
          out. The clues really worked.
                         
                         ROB
          What clues?
                         
                         KIT
          What's this all about? And don't anyone say "April Fool's" or I'll
          smack them in the teeth.
                         
                         MUFFY
          How about if I told you it was the script for a weekend special
          that's going to help me keep this house...
                         
          Rob and Kit stare, mystified.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (SMILING)
          Look, next month I get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true,
          but only if I can show my father that it can carry itself... what with
          taxes and expenses. Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family.
          So, I'm planning on turning it into a country inn. Not just another
          stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in
          offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends. I needed a rehearsal. I
          had to try out the idea on somebody.
                         
                         ROB
                         (TO OTHERS)
          And you guys played along?
                         
                         ARCH
          Don't look at me!
                         
                         NIKKI
          We all got sucked in just as bad as you!
                         MUFFY
          Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise,
          none of it would have worked!
                         
                         ROB
          So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy?
                         
                         MUFFY
          Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy.
                         
                         NIKKI
          His name?
                         
          Muffy smiles, directing attention toward "cousin" Skip.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Skip?!
                         
                         KIT
          He's your brother?!
                         
                         ARCH
          You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (PROTESTING)
          Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull
          that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with
          Buck.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (INTRODUCING)
          Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood.
                         
          Buck reaches down and tosses Arch's decapitated head to him.
                         
                         BUCK
          Here, catch.
                         
          Arch bobbles the head nervously. The others laugh.
                         
                         BUCK
          Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy
          sent me.
                         
                         NIKKI
          It sure fooled me.
                         
                         ARCH
                         (TO SKIP)
          So what castle are you going to inherit?
                         CONSTABLE POTTER
                         (CRITICALLY)
          Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance.
                         
                         KIT
          (to the Constable)
          Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall
          Street.
                         
          Uncle Frank smiles and waves at Kit, but Harvey steps right over to
          him and starts pumping his hand.
                         
                         HARVEY
          Hi! Harvey "Hal" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy.
          But this time he made an exception.
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year
          at Harvard. God, lowe you kids!
                         
                         FERRYMAN CAL
                         (EAGERLY)
          How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around
          here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge.
                         (BEAT: SMILING)
          Well, that's it. Now you know it all.
                         
                         NIKKI
          We have been had.
                         
                         ROB
          You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (LAUGHING)
          I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake
          out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know
          what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you.
                         MUFFY
          ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the
          bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about
          that.
                         
          She avoids looking at Nan so as not to draw attention to her.
                         
          MUFFY (cont.)
          But we had fun, didn't we? I mean, come on.
                         
          She starts passing .out chilled champagne bottles to the men
          to open, and setting up glasses on a sideboard.
                         
          MUFFY (cont.)
          I know I'll never forget this weekend for as long as I live.
                         
                         ARCH
          You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the
          woods, I nearly crapped my pants.
                         
                         CAL
          What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember?
                         
          Silence. Arch turns red.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (QUIETLY)
          Arch? You browned your trousers?
                         
                         ARCH
                         (BEAT; STAMMERING)
          Well... I...
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
                         (GOOD-NATUREDLY)
          It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon.
                         
          Suddenly everyone roars with laughter. Champagne corks start popping,
          and before you know it, the scene is resembling the locker room of the
          winning team of a championship series.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
                         
          Breakfast. Spirits are high. Friendships rekindled, and the spread is
          incredible. Muffy enters with a fresh basket of piping hot biscuits.
          Only Nikki, Harvey, and Cal are not present.
                         
                         ARCH
          Great ham.
                         
                         BUCK
          Great eggs.

          Just what we need. Another country inn.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there.

          Pass the toxic wastes, please.
                         
          Uncle Frank frowns at Skip as Cal enters.
                         
                         CAL
                         (PLEASANTLY)
          The St. John Island Bar Harbor ferry leaves in thirty minutes. No

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Rob and Kit are the first ones in, busing their dishes.
                         
                         ROB
          Boy, what a difference being alive makes.
                         
                         KIT
                         (TURNS; SOFTLY)
          I don't care what Columbia says about you.
                         
                         ROB
          I do.
                         
                         KIT
                         (BEAT)
          Is this the road to med school?
                         
                         ROB
          I think it is. I'm going to try.
                         
          He takes her by the hand and gazes at her.
                         
                         ROB
          But if I make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together?
          You and me?
                         
                         KIT
                         (QUIETLY)
          If that's what you want.
                         
                         ROB
                         (HUGGING HER)
          That's what I want.
          Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets
          her plate on the counter and leaves.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Where's Nikki?
                         
                         KIT
          I don't know. Too much champagne?
                         
          o.s. they hear a muffled cry.
                         
          INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - MORNING
                         
          ...as Harvey finishes plowing her field. They lie still for a moment.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (STILL GASPING)
          God... don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm!
                         
          EXT. BACK PORCH - MORNING
                         
          Uncle Frank is hugging Muffy. (nothing seedy). They are alone out
          here.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can
          draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's
          signing. I'm so proud of you.
                         (BEAT)
          I wish I could say the same about your brother.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me
          get him out here so you can--
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I've already spoken with him.
                         
          The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch. He comes over
          to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank
          just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there.
                         
          UNCLE FRANK (cont.)
          His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable. He knows
          your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he
          shows some signs of responsibility and initiative.
                         
                         ROB
          (embarrassed to be overhearing)
          Excuse me.
          He turns and walks back into the house.
                         
          O.S. a horn honking.
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          The van and the old pickup are idling out front. Uncle Frank is
          honking on the van horn.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Come on! Let's go!
                         
          Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup.
                         
          Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads
          over to the pickup instead. Uncle Frank scowls.
                         
          ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
                         
          Rob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy.
                         
          More honking.
                         
                         KIT
          Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks.
                         (THEY HUG)
          See you back there.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune.
                         
          Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick
          farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles.
                         
          Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs
          aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally
          Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on
          toward the van when...
                         
                         MUFFY
          Nan!
                         
          She hurries to catch up with her.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended.
                         NAN
          And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is
          done.
                         (BEAT)
          I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank
          you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false.
          So I'll just say goodbye.
          (beat; an afterthought)
          Thanks for showing me your house.
                         
          She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout
          their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy
          turns and walks forlornly back into her house.
                         
          EXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING
                         
          Cal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about
          this.
                         
                         CAL
          Aw, it was fun.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids.
          And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been
          spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this
          time it just isn't in the cards.
                         
                         CAL
          It's still in the family.
                         
                         UNCLE FRANK
          Yes, that's the way.
                         
          He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his
          finger at Cal.
                         
                         CHAZ
          This time, no funny business.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
                         
          Muffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to
          begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops.
                         
          She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly
          climbs the stairs.
          EXT. SOUND ­ DAY
                         
          From far away the ferry can be seen chugging away, slowly returning to
          the mainland.
                         
          EXT. FERRY - DAY
                         
          closer now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean
          against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together
          and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also
          alone.
                         
          Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside
          her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to
          the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki.
                         
          He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap.
                         
          Now Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (BEAT)
          Feeling better?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (QUIETLY)
          I'm okay now, thanks.
                         
          Pause.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Chaz, I'm sorry.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Why? What do we mean to each other anyway?
                         
                         NIKKI
          More than this a couple of days ago.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (SMILES SADLY)
          A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young,
          budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art.
          Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as
          much idea as where he's going as... as...
                         
          He gives up.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (TENDERLY)
          Don't be down.
                         CHAZ
          Sure.
                         
          Pause.
                         
                         NIKKI
          I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one
          fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a
          boyfriend.
                         (BEAT)
          Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend?
                         
          He looks at her, slowly softening. Yes, he will.
                         
          Rob turns away from Skip now, steps over and surveys the quiet group.
                         
                         ROB
          Some party, huh?
                         
                         ARCH
                         (REFLECTIVELY)
          You know what I think's weird?... how, when we thought 'Buck here got
          hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we
          thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of
          naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of
          the prank.'
                         
                         SKIP
                         (FROWNS)
          What're you talking about?
                         
                         ARCH
          Well, it's like pranks really piss people off. It unleashes things,
          you know? Makes any kind of behavior possible, and we accept it.
                         
                         NIKKI
          When anything g.oes, everything goes.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Yeah.
                         
                         ROB
          What really amazes me is how easy we made it for her. Everyone was
          just out for himself. We could've stopped Muffy cold if we'd only
          stuck together, if we'd only worked like a team.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Yeah, she really got us good.
                         
                         SKIP
          Well, I know what I'd do, if I wasn't her brother...
                         NIKKI
          (almost without thinking)
          Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we
          should do.
                         
          Nikki steps. Leeks up, hearing herself. Skip returns the stare.
                         
                         SKIP
          (shrugs, smiling)
          Did I say anything?
          The others look at each other, a beat, registering.
                         
                         ARCH
          Hey...
                         
                         CHAZ
          Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change? Outrageous!
                         
                         NIKKI
          She sure wouldn't be expecting it...!

          Well, I don't know. I got a stack o' books this high...
                         
                         ROB
          (stepping into the fray)
          Harvey's right.
          (to them all)
          Look, what're you talking about? We've had our fun. Now we got work to
          do.
                         
                         ARCH
          Yeah. Enough's enough. At least for me anyway.
                         
                         CHAZ
          Pussies.

          Well, I kinda like the idea -- and I don't have work to get back to.
                         
          She squares her shoulders.
                         
                         ROB

                         (DECIDEDLYL
          Muffy can dish it out. It might be interesting to see if she can take
          it.

          All right! A real catfight!

          Too late. Uncle Frank is driving away. He speeds past Skip who is
          walking down the road further along. He doesn't even stop for his own
          nephew.
                         
          Harvey kicks the dirt angrily. O.S. behind him a horn toots. Harvey
          turns and scowls at Nan, who would like to get past. He steps aside,
          and she peels away but she stops for Skip.
                         
          They exchange a few words. Then he climbs into the front seat beside
          her, and she drives off.
                         
          Now Harvey is alone. He looks around for a beat, then tosses the card
          away and moves toward his car.

          No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we
          had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a
          hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you.

          Listen, I need a drink of water.
                         (RISING)
          You just stay here. I can get it myself.
                         
          She walks out of the living room. Muffy looks after her and smiles to
          herself.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          as Nikki enters. She doesn't turn on any lights, but simply crosses to
          one of the kitchen windows and opens it.
                         
          She gazes out into the night for a moment, then backs out of
          the kitchen...
                         
          INT. DINING ROM - NIGHT
                         
          ...pulling the swinging door closed behind her. She turns, takes two
          steps toward the living room and stops; remembering her water.
                         
          She goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for
          her. Frustrated, she heads back through the dining room, but stops
          dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen
          door. She goes out of the dining room...
                         
          INT . DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          ...and walks up to the other door into the kitchen. It too it's closed
          and will not yield.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          as Nikki returns.
                         
                         MUFFY
          What about your water?
                         
                         NIKKL
          Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there.
                         (BEAT)
          Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we
          should go out and see what's happened.
                         
                         MUFFY
          That's okay. You go. I'll wait here.
                         
                         NIKKI
          No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last
          night. Please come with me.
                         MUFFY
          I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's
          safer this way.
                         (BEAT)
          Do you want a flashlight?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (IRRITATED)
          No, that's okay. I'll be fine.
                         
          She strides out of the living room.
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - SAME
          as Nikki comes out the front door and heads off into the woods.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (MUTTERING)
          Shit.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy sits quietly a moment, thinking. Then she gets up and goes
          toward the kitchen.
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL -
                         
          She comes to the kitchen door, pushes it open... no sweat... and enters.
                         
          INT . KITCHEN - SAME
                         
          Muffy doesn't turn any lights on either. She goes to the sink, sees
          that there is no used water glass, then' she notices the open window.
          She smiles.
                         
          She does get herself a bottle of Perrier out of the fridge, opens it,
          pours it and walks back out of the kitchen, leaving the window
          untouched.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          Nikki stumbles through the darkness. Suddenly she disappears from view
          with a loud SPLASH.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Fuck!
                         
          She comes up sputtering to the surface of a small forest pool she has
          fallen into.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Fuck!! Who dug the goddamn swimming pool?!?
          She drags herself out.
                         
          KIT (o.s.)
          Nikki?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (CALLING BACK)
          Yeah!
                         
          She walks, dripping wet, into a clearing nearby where Kit it making
          Chaz up to look bloody and gruesome.
                         
          NIKKI .
          We have to go to plan B.
                         
                         CHAZ
          She wouldn't come out? Doesn't she care about me?
                         
          No one answers him.
                         
          CHAZ (cont.)
          How do I look?
                         
                         NIKKI
          A lot goddamn, fucking better than I do!
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          No one is here as' Rob pops his head up outside and slips in through
          the open window.
                         
          He stops in the middle of the kitchen and listens. Then he
          goes into...
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME
                         
          He creeps down the hall, then turns and starts to tiptoe up the
          back stairs.
                         
          CAMERA DOLLIES further down the hall to...
                         
          INT. FRONT ENTRY - SAME
                         
          ...just as Nikki bursts in through the door.
                         
          NIKKI ,
          Muffy! Muffy! Come quick! It's Chaz...
          INT . LIVING ROOM - SAME
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (RUNNING IN)
          ...he's hurt! Oh, Godl!
                         
          She stops suddenly. Muffy isn't here. Frustrated, Nikki runs
          back into...
                         
          INT. FRONT ENTRY - SAME
                         
          She looks around.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffy!!
                         
          She dashes into...
                         
          INT. STUDY - SAME
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muff--!!!
                         
          ...and stops short. Muffy is lying face down in a pool of blood. Her
          throat's been cut. The useless phone receiver is clutched in her hand
          (making that constant phone company noise that lets you know the phone
          is off the hook).
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (RISING PANIC)
          Muffy?
                         
          Her throat gags a couple of times, as if she is about to be sick. She
          turns and flies out of the room.
          O.S. the front door slams shut behind her.
                         
          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
                         
          NIKKI (O.S,)
                         (HYSTERICAL)
          Chaz!! Chaz!!
                         
          She runs into another clearing (the CAMERA has been here waiting for
          her) where Chaz is revealed lying on the ground, looking much more
          hideous than Muffy.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Chaz, get up! ·Hurry, Chaz!... come on!
                         
          He doesn't move.
                         NIKKI
          Chaz, stop playing around! Get up!!
                         
          She starts kicking him in the side.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Chaz!
                         
          Chaz doesn't stir, but he does speak now without moving his lips.
                         
                         CHAZ
          (hissing, pretending to be dead)
          Will you quit kicking me? It hurts.
                         
                         NIKKI
          It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up!
                         
                         CHAZ
          (still not moving)
          No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy?
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (SHRIEKING)
          Muffy IS dead!!! In the house!!!
                         (WHIMPERING)
          Oh, God...
                         
                         CHAZ
          (sitting up suddenly)
          What?
                         
                         NIKKI
          (turning to the woods)
          Kit! Kit, come out!
                         
          There is rustling O.S., then Kit starts to emerge.
                         
                         KIT
          What's going on?
                         
          INT. STUDY - SAME
                         
          Muffy is still lying face down as we saw her last. She hears footsteps
          going upstairs.
                         
          INT. ATTIC - SAME
                         
          Rob is creeping up the attic stairs when he hears footsteps o.s. too.
          He pauses, his face draining of color.
          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          as Chaz, Nikki and Kit come racing up to the door and run inside.
                         
          INT. STUDY - SAME
                         
          as they come charging in...
                         
                         NIKKI
          She's gone!
                         
          Nothing left, but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying
          blood to indicate that she's been dragged away.
                         
                         KIT
          What?...
                         
                         CHAZ
          Look, she's been dragged away.
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (PANICKING)
          Chaz! somebody's still in this house!
                         
                         CHAZ
          We could follow the trail.
                         
                         KIT
                         (DREAD)
          Oh, no... what about Rob?
                         (HALF BEAT)
          Rob!!
                         
          She races out of the study.
                         
          INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
                         
          The three of them come clambering up the stairs, Kit in the lead. They
          turn a corner. Then they see him... dead on the floor.
                         
                         KIT
          Rob...?
                         
          They run over to him.
                         
                         KIT
          (dropping to her knees)
          Rob? Rob??
          (shaking him: wailing)
          Rob!!!
          (dissolving into tears)
          It was only a game!
                         CHAZ
                         (SCARED SHITLESS)
          What the fuck is going on here?!
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (POINTING)
          Chaz, look!
                         
          Clutched in Rob's lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have
          noticed before. Chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers.
                         
                         CHAZ
                         (DAZED)
          This was Nan's...
                         
                         NIKKI
                         (TREMBLING)
          Nan...
                         
          Suddenly there is a loud KNOCK beneath them O.S. They all look up.
          Someone is coming slowly up the stairs, the loud footsteps O.S.that
          could only be made by a heavy boot, thundering closer... and closer...
                         
          Kit and Nikki and Chaz huddle around Rob's body and await their
          approaching doom.
                         
          Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs. A
          hand with a knife is raised. ·Nikki screams. Chaz spies a lamp on the
          floor. He turns it on...
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffy!
                         
          Muffy walks into the room , lowering the knife.
                         
                         MUFFY
          Good job, you guys. I'm really scared.
                         (LOOKING DOWN)
          The fun's over, Rob.
                         
                         KIT
          (tears in her eyes)
          Muffy, he's dead!
                         
                         NIKKI
          Somebody else is here! In this house!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Sure. Sure.
                         (BENDING OVER)
          Let's see if the dead are ticklish, shall we?
                         KIT
          (pulling her away; screaming)
          Don't you touch him!!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Okay, okay, take it easy.
                         
                         NIKKI
          Muffy, it's not a game anymore!
                         
          Just then there is a loud CRASH o.s. of glass breaking down on the
          first floor. After the slightest pause there is another crash o.s.,
          and another...
                         
          Someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch. Nikki
          screams.
                         
                         MUFFY
                         (ALARMED)
          What the--?
                         
          And she runs back down the attic stairs, followed quickly by the
          others.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
                         
          as Muffy bursts out of the stairway and into the hall. Then
          Kit.
                         
          Suddenly the door to the stairwell slams shut on Nikki and Chaz
          cutting them off. A key turns in the lock. Muffy and Kit turn back to
          see a male figure in the darkness who'd been hiding behind the door.
                         
          Kit is nearest to him, and without warning, he lunges at her and
          buries a knife into her stomach ·up to the handle.
                         
          Kit screams and chokes, trying to fight him off: but he stabs her
          again, and again and again, plunging the knife deep into her with
          every thrust.
                         
                         KIT
          Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me!
                         
          Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the
          hallway, down the stairs...
                         
          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
                         
          ...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence. Muffy
          yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open. She pulls again
          and again desperately, but it won't budge,
          She turns and runs out of the entry hall. Just as she CLEARS FRAME,
          the front door swings silently open...
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
                         
          Muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when A HAND
          reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face.
                         
          She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the
          darkened pantry.
                         
          INT. PANTRY ­ SAME
                         
          It is Skip!
                         
          He pulls her head back, exposing her throat. He raises a knife to it,
          still stained with Kit's blood.
                         
                         SKIP
                         (RAVING)
          It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine!
                         
                         MUFFY
          Skip! No! ! !
                         
          He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open
          the swinging door and sees...
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          ...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake
          blood and mess... Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan. Muffy's eyes pop out.
          Skip's hands relax. And the others burst out laughing.
                         
                         FADE OUT
                         
                         FADE IN
                         
          EXT. THE HOUSE ­ DAY
                         
                         CLOSE UP
                         
          A SIGN being lifted into the air. It reads:

          Proprietors: St. John et Frere
                         
          PULL BACK to see Muffy supervising the raising of the sign in front of
          the house, while Skip drives up in the van, bringing the first
          customers to the door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
					   ASH
			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
									   SUPERIMPOSE:
4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
	   sweep past the moon.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
15	 ASH												 15
	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
20	 ASH												 20
	   looks up from the dust to behold...
21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
23	 ASH												 23
	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
25	 ARTHUR											   25
	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
	   waves a shaky hand.
					   ASH
			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
29	 ARTHUR											   29
	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
	   is cut. A thin red gash.
					   ARTHUR
			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
					   ARTHUR
			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
			   To the pit with the blackard!
32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
	   He tumbles from the horse.
34	 ASH												 34
	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
36	 ASH												 36
	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
					   ARTHUR
			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
	   They are gaining an Ash.
43	 ASH												 43
	   glances behind him.
44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
45	 ASH												 45
	   whips his horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYPU!
46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
	   WHOOSH!!!
47	 ASH												 47
	   ducks the blade.
48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
	   THUNK!
49	 ASH												 49
	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
	   WHOOSH!
	   ASH looks left...
50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
	   winds up for another blow.
51	 ASH												 51
	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
	   swings.
54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
	   is knocked from his steed.
56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
	   ride at one another.
59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
	   swinging his Broadsword.
60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
62	 ASH												 62
	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
63	 ASH												 63
	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
	   charges and swings his broadsword.
65	 ASH												 65
	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
	   is knocked from his horse.
67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
69	 ASH												 69
	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
70	 ARTHUR											   70
	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
					   ARTHUR
			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
					   ASH
			   No!
72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
					   ARTHUR
			   To the castle!
73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   Move along now!
									   DISSOLVE TO:
77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
	   SHEILA
	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
					   ARTHUR
			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
	   SHEILA
	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.
					   SHEILA
			   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!
			   Thou art a Murderer!  A black
			   Murderer!
80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
	   restrain her.
	   SHEILA
	   cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1
			   May you be consoled by their
			   suffering in the pit.
81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
	   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
	   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
	   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
	   ground. This is THE PIT.
82	 ASH												 82
	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
	   what they have in store for him.
83	 SHEILA											   83
	   stares at him in hatred.
84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
	   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.
					   DUKE HENRY
			   You sir, are not one of my
			   vassals.  Who are you?
					   ASH
			   Who wants to know?
					   DUKE HENRY
			   I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
			   Lord of the Northlands and leader
			   of its people.
					   ASH
			   You ain't leadin' but two things
			   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack
			   left town.
85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS			    85
	   address the doomed men:
					   ARTHUR
			   There is an Evil that has awakened
			   in this land.  And whilst my
			   people fight for their very souls
			   against it, you, Duke Henry the
			   Red, wage war on us. Your people
			   are no better than the foul
			   corruption that lies in the bowels
			   of that pit!  May God have mercy
			   on your souls.
86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
	   crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
	   slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.
87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
	   a echoed wailing rises up.
88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
	   stiffen in fear.
89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
					   OLD WOMAN
			   Aye. Into the pit with the
			   bloodthirsty sons of whores!
	   She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
	   CAMERA PANS TO...
90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
	   as he's thrown down into the pit.  He disappears into the
	   blackness.
91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
	   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
	   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
	   looking down into the blackness we hear:
					   HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
			   I beg of you... by all that's
			   holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh,
			   for the love of god!  no!  NO!!!
			   AIIIIIiiieee!
	   The sound of ripping and scratching.  The SHRIEK of terror is
	   cut short as...
	   A GEYSER OF BLOOD
	   erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
93	 ASH												 93
	   is frozen in fear.
					   TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
			   There!  He's escaping!
	   ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
	   jerks from the pit to...
94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
	   making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open
	   drawbridge.
95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS									  95
	   spot him and fire arrows.
96	 ANGLE ON											 96
	   PING!  PING!
	   They bounce off the Warrior's armor.  He's makes it to the open
	   drawbridge when...
97	 ARTHUR											   97
	   pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.
	   CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						   98
	   The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
	   a wooden post.  He dies standing.
99	 THE CROWD											99
	   Cheers.  They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
	   CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
	   in line...
100	ASH												 100
	   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
					   ASH
			   Hey, I never even saw these
			   assholes before..
	   He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
			   You gotta tell 'em you don't know
			   me. We never met. Tell him.
					   HENRY
			   I do not believe that he shall
			   listen.
101	THE WARRIORS										  101
	   grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
102	ASH												 102
	   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
	   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful

	   of the rancid water. He looks about.
103	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 103
	   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
104	ASH												 104
	   spins to a small sound.
105	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 105
	   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.
106	ASH												 106
	   shifts his glance again.
107	A SHADOW											 107
	   rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
108	ASH												 108
	   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
	   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
	   break the surface.
109	ASH												 109
	   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,
	   he is confronted by...
	   A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
	   It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
	   face!
110	CLOSER											   110
	   Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
	   jerks like a marionette as it advances.
111	ASH SCREAM										    111
	   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to
	   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
	   clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH									  113
	   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS			   114
	   hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE								   115
	   grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA								  116
	   shouts for Ash's death.
117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE								    117
	   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
118	LONG SHOT - ASH									    118
	   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
119	THE DEADITE										   119
	   races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
	   kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
120	ASH												 120
	   cries out in pain.
121	ASH'S LEGS										    121
	   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He
	   flips the beast.
122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
	   rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
	   with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
123	THE DEADITE										   123
	   grabs Ash by the throat.
124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
	   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
125	THE DEADITE										   125
	   advances.
126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
	   shouts down at Ash.
127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
	   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
	   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
	   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an
	   object falling at him through the glare above.
128	THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION							   128
	   tumbling downward.  Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its
	   blade of steel.  Ash's Excalibur!
129	ASH - SLOW MOTION									  129
	   summons his strength and leaps upward.
130	LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION		   130
	   Tumbling downward...
131	HIGH ANGLE- ASH									    131
	   ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars
	   past CAMERA.
132	LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION								 132
	   Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
133	ASH'S STUMP										   133
	   snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
134	ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW								   134
	   He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
					   ASH
			   Come on, you blasted piece of--
	   He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
	   VERRROOOOOOM!!
135	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS				   135
	   gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.  Blue exhaust billows up from
	   the pit.
136	THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE						 136
	   lunges at Ash.
137	DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW								  137
	   Buzzzzz!!
138	ASH												 138
	   is splattered with black bile.
139	THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND							   139
	   flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast.
140	CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND							   140
	   as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.
141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND				  141
	   flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
	   spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
	   and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
	   hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
	   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite
	   hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
143	CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH								   143
	   Ash decapitates the beast.
144	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS				  144
	   stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this
	   guy's guts and style.
145	THE LAST REMNANTS									  145
	   of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
146	ASH												 146
	   climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges
	   from the earthen wall before him.
147	ASH												 147
	   slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it
	   back into the water.
148	ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS							148
	   gasp as...
	   THUMP!
149	ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM									 149
	   comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's
	   bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood
	   of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
	   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
					   ASH
			   All right now. Who wants to be
			   next?  Who wants some.
150	GOLD TOOTH										    150
	   look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
					   ASH
			   You want some more?  Huh?!
	   Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out
	   to Henry.
					   ASH
			   Now climb on those horses and get
			   out of here.
151	HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS							   151
	   quickly mount horses.
					   ARTHUR
			   Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
152	ASH												 152
	   slaps Henry's horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYUP NOW!!  HYAAAH!
153	THE STUNNED CROWD									  153
	   parts allowing...
154	HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS								  154
	   to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
155	ARTHUR											   155
	   stares at Ash with hatred.
					   ARTHUR
			   For that, I shall see you dead.
156	ASH												 156
	   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
	   turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
					   ASH
			   This is my boomstick. It's a
			   twelve gauge, double barreled
			   Remington pump. Next one of you
			   primitives touch me...
157	ASH SPINS,										    157
	   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
	   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
	   on the forgotten chain.
	   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
	   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
158	ANGLE ON											 158
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it
	   summersaulting down into the pit.
159	THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST							    159
	   echoes off the mountains like distant thunder.
160	SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD				   160
	   look to Ash in reverence.

161	ASH												 161
	   twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,
	   WHOOSH...  and holsters it.
					   ASH
			   Bring me your hoo do man.
162	EXT. BLACKBIRDS									    162
	   fly from a barren tree.
163	SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS						   163
	   It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly
	   past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing...
164	EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					  164
	   A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
	   twenty feet tall.  The remains of an ancient temple.  In the
	   center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire.  As old Woman
	   stirs a cauldron atop the flames.  Nearby, Arthur converses with
	   his four Lieutenants.
165	EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT							165
	   CLOSE UP - ASH
	   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner
	   has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves
	   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
	   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
	   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages
	   Ash's wounds.
167	SHEILA											   167
	   is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
					   SHEILA
			   I pray thee to forgive me.  I
			   believed thee one of Henry's men.
	   She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
					   ASH
			   First you wanta kill me, now ya
			   wanna kiss me.
	   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
					   ASH
			   Lady, just leave me alone.
					   SHEILA
			   I'm sorry m'lord. Please
			   understand... T'is a cruel time
			   for us. The Wisemen say you are
			   the promised one. Our only hope
			   against the darkness that has
			   descended on this land.
					   ASH
			   They're mistaken.
	   She stares deeply into his eyes.
					   SHEILA
			   I think not.  I feel that there
			   is reason for your being here.
			   It is no accident.
166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN				  167
	   approach.  They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from
	   Ash.
					   ASH
			   Well what is it?  Can you send me
			   back or not?
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Only the Necronomicon has the
			   power.  A power which we both
			   require. It contains passages that
			   can dispel the Evil from this
			   place and return you to your time.
					   ASH
			   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
			   the thing that got me here.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   It is in a place far from here.
			   It can only be retrieved by the
			   Promised one. Other Warriors have
			   tried.  Their widows grieve still.
			   We have waited long years for you.
			   Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
			   Thou must undertake to quest for
			   it.  Alone must thou travel to
			   a distant cemetery. There thou
			   shalt find it.
					   ASH
			   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm
			   goin' is home.
	   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
169	DOGS												169
	   around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
170	ASH AND SHEILA										170
	   turn to see...
171	THE OLD WOMAN										 171
	   now standing too close to the fire.  Her robes ignites.  She does
	   not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir
	   the caldron.
172	ASH												 172
	   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...
173	THE BURNING WOMAN									  173
	   spins sharply to him.  Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL DIE!
	   Her eyes are bone white.  She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by
	   invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal
	   snarl. With two voice at once;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
			   NECRONOMICON.  WE SHALL FEAST UPON
			   YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
			   MAN!
174	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									174
	   collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in
	   the dust.
175	CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA		 175
	   Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open!  A nasty grin forms
	   on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen
	   approach.
176	WISEMAN JOHN										  176
	   kneels and reaches for her.
177	ASH'S HAND										    177
	   clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
					   ASH
			   It's a trick.  Get an axe.

178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178
	   awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK.  In a
	   frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and
	   rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY							    179
	   With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one
	   of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two
	   warriors beneath it.
180	A GIGANTIC STONE									   180
	   topples the next stone.
	   BOOM!
	   Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!
	   Like giant dominoes, they fall.
181	ASH												 181
	   watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
182	ANGLE ON											 182
	   The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA!
183	THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA					    183
	   She SCREAMS!
184	SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES					   184
	   coming toward CAMERA.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
185	ASH												 185
	   does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the
	   stone's deadly path.
186	ASH AND SHEILA										186
	   rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.
187	CLOSE SHOT - ASH									   187
	   rolls into frame and glances up to see...
188	THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN						   188
	   rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK!
189	WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN				 189
	   latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the
	   ground.
190	ASH												 190
	   rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
191	ANGLE ON											 191
	   The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
192	EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE			 192
	   THE POSSESSES WOMAN
	   SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH!  The multi-ton stone crushes her
	   legs to paste.  Her legs are pinned but still she battles on,
	   clutching Ash about his throat!
193	ASH												 193
	   gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of
	   the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.
194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
	   Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an
	   impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
195	ASH												 195
	   grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the
	   monster's oversized throat.  She chokes.
196	GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS					    196
	   grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.  Arthur comes to meet
	   them.  He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
197	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									197
	   vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten
			   will rise to take my place.  All
			   will die.  ALL WILL -
	   CHOP!
198	IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE								  198
	   is brought down upon her throat.  The possessed body flails and
	   spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
199	THE HEAD											 199
	   rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet.  It's eyes pop open!
					   POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD
			   ---DIE!
200	ARTHUR											   200
	   grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.  The
	   head sails away as the laughter receded.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Now.  Will thou quest for the
			   Necronomicon?
201	CLOSE ON ASH										  201
	   He considers.
202	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY				   202
	   Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.
203	ASH												 203
	   points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.
204	THE BLACKSMITH										204
	   pounds upon the hand armor, modifying it.
205	SHEILA											   205
	   knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.
206	BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY							  206
	   THE BLACKSMITH
	   attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
207	ASH												 207
	   tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a
	   ratchet like device.
208	ASH												 208
	   extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.
	   WHOOSH!  CLANG!
209	SHEILA											   209
	   gasps.
210	ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND							210
	   SNAPS open with great force.
211	ANGLE ON											 211
	   WHOOSH CLANG!
	   ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND
	   clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron
	   goblet.
212	CLOSE ON ASH										  212
	   He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
213	EXT. CASTLE TURRET - NIGHT							   213
	   ASH
	   stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with
	   apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears
	   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
	   cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around
	   her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one
	   another and kiss.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
214	EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY		    214
	   Arthur's castle in the distance.  In the foreground, five men

	   long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind.
215	CLOSER ON RIDERS - TRUCKING SHOT						  215
	   Arthur and Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur's
	   Warriors.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
	   ASH
	   He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army
	   that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw
	   juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape
	   billows as he rides.

	   ARTHUR
	   points to...
217	THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM						   217
	   It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits
	   an eerie whistling.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   This is the edge of the land ruled
			   by the Dark Spirit. This path will
			   lead you to an unholy place. A
			   cemetery. There, the Necronomicon
			   awaits.
218	ASH												 218
	   anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
219	THE TWO WARRIORS									   219

			   A moment.
220	WISEMAN JOHN										  220
	   moves close to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   As thou removest the Book from

					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Repeat them.
					   ASH

					   ASH
			   I got it.  I got it.  I know your
			   damn words. All right?  Now you get
			   this straight: I get the book,
			   you send me back. That's the deal.
			   After that I'm history.
	   Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
221	ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN								 221
	   watch as Ash disappears.
222	IN A SEA OF MIST									   222
	   The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS.  A form materializes out of the
	   fog:  It is Ash.
223	CLOSER ON ASH										 223
	   He whips the horse.
					   ASH
			   HAAAAAA!
224	ANGLE ON ASH										  224
	   He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick
	   fog.
									   FADE OUT.
225	EXT. TRAIL'S ENTRANCE TO WOODS						    225
	   ASH
	   rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail
	   leading into a thick forest.
226	EXT. WOODS										    226
	   LONG SHOT - ASH
	   rides slowly on through the darkening woods.
227	CLOSER ON ASH										 227
	   He hears a sound and look to...
228	A SECTION OF WOODS									 228
	   A branch SCRAPING against the bark of a tree.
229	ASH												 229
	   hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to...
230	A BUBBLING BROOK									   230
	   and nothing more.
231	THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V.								   231
	   powers through the woods toward Ash.
232	ASH												 232
	   kick his steed and bolts.
233	THE EVIL FORCE										233
	   sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
234	ASH												 234
	   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which
	   jut from the ground.
235	THE EVIL FORCE										235
	   rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks.  It
	   burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
236	ASH												 236
	   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He
	   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,
	   he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to
	   the mud as the horse gallops off.
	   He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
237	THE EVIL FORCE										237
	   follows Ash down a wooded trail.
238	ASH												 238
	   running for...
239	EXT. WOODEN SHED									   239
	   a grain storage house in the clearing ahead.
240	ASH												 240
	   comes upon the shed's door.  Locked.  He heaves his body against
	   it but it won't give.
241	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						241
	   A log, that serves as the door's bolt, holds fast.
242	THE EVIL FORCE										242
	   emerges from over the ridge.
243	ASH												 243
	   unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw
	   from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click.
	   He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT
	   that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his
	   arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!
244	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						244
	   The blade bites into the log that bolts the door.
245	THE EVIL FORCE										245
	   draws closer.
246	INT. SHED											246
	   CLOSE ON CHAINSAW BLADE
	   halfway through the log.  Sawdust flies.
247	EXT. SHED											247
					   ASH
			   Come on!  Come on!
	   The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt.
	   Putt.
					   ASH
			   Blasted piece of junk!
248	THE EVIL FORCE										248
	   draws closer.
249	ASH												 249
	   delivers a mighty kick to the door.
250	INT. SHED											250
	   ANGLE ON DOOR
	   The partially cut log gives way.  Ash tumbles into the storage
	   shed. He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the
	   log across the latch, re-bolting it.
251	THE EVIL FORCE										251
	   Hammers at the door of the Shed.
	   BANG!
252	INT. SHED											252
	   A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
	   BANG!
	   Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder
	   behind Ash.
253	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  253
	   It cracks.
254	ASH												 254
	   presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying
	   that whatever it out there, won't get in.
	   BANG!  Splinters fly.
255	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  255
	   BOOM!  The crack widens.
256	THE DOOR FRAME										256
	   behind Ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
257	ASH												 257
	   begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts.
258	LONG SHOT - INT. SHED								   258
	   All is quiet.  Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.  And
	   that's when it hits.  LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
	   Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
	   the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
259	INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER					 259
	   TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
	   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
	   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
	   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,
	   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
	   as he flies through the air.
260	EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT								   260
	   The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
	   flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
	   wave.
261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the
	   other doors.  The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to
	   the ground in a stack.
262	THE EVIL FORCE										262
	   with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods.
263	EXT. SHED- DUSK									    263
	   LOOKING DOWN UPON - THE STACKS OF DOORS.
	   All is quiet.  We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob
	   turns slightly.  The door swings upward and opens... revealing
	   a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
	   up.

	   He beholds...
264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264
	   An empty place of stone and wood.  Driven by the wind, the
	   Mill's giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak.
265	INT. MILL											265
	   ASH
	   enters the Mill.
					   ASH
			   Anybody here?!
	   The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his
	   breath.
					   ASH
			   This place'll do for the night.
			   Get the book in the morning.
266	INT. MILL - THREE SHOTS - INTERVOLOMETER				    266
	   Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.
267	ASH												 267
	   peers through the window.
268	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT THE SUN - DAY					    268
	   a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.  The wind
	   kicks up.
269	INT. MILL											269
	   ASH
	   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
	   of the gale.
270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270
	   on the window quietly KNOCK.  Ash shivers and rubs his arms for
	   warmth.
					   ASH
			   Damn this cold.
271	ASH												 271
	   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
272	GASOLINE											 272
	   pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
273	ASH												 273
	   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the
	   flame for warmth.
					   ASH
			   'least I won't freeze to death.
	   He turns to a tiny sound.
274	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    274
	   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
	   past.

275	ASH												 275
	   spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
	   BLAMITY-BLAM!
	   The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW				    276
	   Only the night woods.  The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
	   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
	   a tree branch swaying in the wind.
277	ASH												 277
	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
	   crack.
278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
	   through the crack in the door.
279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND						   279
	   CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is
	   movement.
280	LONG SHOT - EXT. MILL								   280
	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
283	A STARTLED ASH										283
	   leaps aside just in time.
284	ASH												 284
	   snags the horse's reigns.
					   ASH
			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
286	EXT. MILL											286
	   ASH
	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
	   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
287	INT. MILL											287
	   ASH
	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror
	   fragments and land on the floor.
290	ASH												 290
	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
	   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they
	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
292	ASH												 292
	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
294	ASH												 294
	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
295	THE TINY ASHES										295
	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
296	ASH												 296
	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
297	TINY ASH #1										   297
	   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
	   him.
298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
	   a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
	   WHOOSHES past.
	   FA-THONG!
299	THE FORK											 299
	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
300	ASH												 300
	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
	   is pushed off a high shelf.
	   CLANG!
302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD								  302
	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
303	ASH												 303
	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the
	   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
	   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
	   needles jutting from it.
304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
	   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little
	   imps.
305	TINY ASH #2										   305
	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
306	ASH												 306
	   has seen him.  He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
	   #2 into the stove's fire.
					   ASH
			   Ooops.
307	TINY ASH #2										   307
	   is burned alive.
308	ASH												 308
	   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
309	TINY ASH #3										   309
	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
	   RIP!!
310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
	   through Ash's shoe.
311	ASH												 311
	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
312	ASH												 312
	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his
	   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
	   air.  As he inhales...
315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
	   is released.
316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316
	   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
317	ASH												 317
	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
					   ASH
			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
	   ASH
	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
319	ASH												 319
	   watches in horror as...
320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
321	THE IRON HAND										 321
	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
322	ASH												 322
	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
	   cranks the vice's handle.
324	THE VICE											 324
	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326
	   stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.  But Ash expertly dodges each
	   stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
	   is super fast motion.
327	ASH												 327
	   with is head still wedged in the vice.
					   ASH
			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328
	   has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.  He emits
	   a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
					   ASH
			   Soon as I get out of this thing
			   I... YIEEEE!!
	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
					   ASH
			   No!  Not the teeth!
	   YANK!
329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
	   his inspection.  It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
330	ASH'S HEAD										    330
	   struggling in the grip of the vice.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell are ya!?
331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
	   grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
					   ASH
			   I can't see ya!!
	   HIS EVIL HAND
	   raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
	   right half of his body.
					   ASH
			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
332	ASH												 332
	   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up
	   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE
	   BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333
	   It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.  Beneath it, a mouth and nose
	   begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
334	ASH												 334
	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA
	   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
	   woods.
335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
	   ASH
	   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the

	   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
	   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
	   sprout from Ash's body!
342	A LEG											    342
	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...
345	BAD ASH.											 345
	   They square off beneath the moonlight.
346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES							   346
	   circle one another like wolves.
					   GOOD ASH
			   What... are you?  Are you me?
					   BAD ASH
			   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You
			   sound like a jerk!
					   GOOD ASH
			   Why are you doing this?!
					   BAD ASH
			   Wanna know?  'cause the answers
			   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
			   and yer...
347	EVIL ASH											 347
	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
					   EVIL ASH
			   ...Little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little good--
348	EVIL ASH											 348
	   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
	   at his nose.
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN						   349
	   blown backwards into a double backflip.
350	EVIL ASH'S BODY									    350
	   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
	   quite dead.
351	GOOD ASH											 351
	   clutching the smoldering shotgun.
					   GOOD ASH
			   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the
			   gun.
352	LONG SHOT - ASH									    352
	   staring down at the body of his evil self.
					   ASH
			   I know better than to bury you
			   whole.
353	EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					    353
	   The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
	   of lightning.  The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
	   of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
	   The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
	   WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:									  354
	   Ash's hand light a torch.
355	FRIGHTENED BATS FLY									355
	   from the base of the windmill.
356	CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT								 356
	   across the body of Evil Ash to secure it.
	   CLICK. SNAP. CLINK.
357	THE CHAINSAW										  357
	   is switched on.  It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
358	ASH												 358
	   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil

	   task.
359	EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS						 359
	   float past the moon.  We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.
360	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT								  360
	   ASH
	   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
	   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
					   ASH
			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that
			   away from him.
361	ASH												 361
	   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves
	   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
362	INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD						    362
	   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It
	   croaks;
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   You'll never get that Book. I will
			   come back for you.
					   ASH
			   Hey, what's that you got on your
			   face?
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   Huh?
363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD							   363
	   It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a
	   shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.
364	EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO						    364
	   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
365	ASH												 365
	   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his
	   head;
					   ASH
				   (muttering under his
				    breath)
			   Rest in pieces.
366	ASH												 366
	   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
	   grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
	   in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
	   GROANS in the gale.
					   ASH
			   This must be it. The cemetery.
368	ASH												 368
	   moves toward the cemetery.
369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY							  369
	   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
370	ASH												 370
	   draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.
	   He glances down to...
371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL					   371
	   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
	   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw
	   bone drops open with a squeak.
372	CLOSE ON ASH										  372
	   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
	   backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and
	   shadow.
374	ASH												 374
	   arrives at the foot of the massive stone.
375	UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE								375
	   Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
376	CAMERA PANS REVEALING...								376
	   A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
377	CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING...						    377
	   A THIRD!
378	CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL:				 378
	   THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
379	A BAFFLED ASH										 379
	   steps close.
					   ASH
			   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said
			   anything about that. Ha!  That
			   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
			   fulla his secret words and phrases
			   and, and, his... bullshit, he
			   forgot to mention anything about
			   that.  Like do I take all of 'em
			   of one or 'em, or what?  Well...
	   He reaches for the first book and opens it.
380	ANGLE ON											 380
	   WHOOOOOOSH!!!
	   To reveal a black hole.  SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
	   the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
	   dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
	   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
	   stronger.
383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
	   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET								  384
	   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD									  385
	   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
386	ASH PUPPET										    386
	   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
	   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH							    387
	   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
	   normal.
					  ASH
			   Woah.  Wrong book.
	   He turns to study...
388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
	   ASH
	   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it
	   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
	   the other.
389	THE BOOK											 389
	   moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
					   ASH
			   Huh.
	   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
	   Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.  The Book
	   flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
	   like a bat!
391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED				  391
	   Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
392	THE BATBOOK										   392
	   shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
	   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
393	ASH												 393
	   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
	   pedestal.
394	ASH												 394
	   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind
	   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
	   It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!  Two empty
	   eye sockets stare out from it.  This is the Book of the Dead...
396	ASH												 396
	   bristles in fear.
					   ASH
			   Okay.   The words.  Say the words.
			   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...
			   Necta... uh... Nectar...
			   Necktie... uh...
	   He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
					   ASH
			   KLATOO... VERATA...
			   NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
	   He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
	   The wind stops.  It seems to have worked.  He looks about with
	   growing confidence.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
	   soundtrack.
397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY								    397
	   ASH
	   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
	   one are thrust from the earth.

398	EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT									398
	   A violent storm in the distance.  Lightning flashes.
399	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							399
	   A DOOR
	   blows open revealing Wiseman John.  He looks at the gathering
	   storm with foreboding.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Something is amiss.
400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
	   WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
	   out at the storm.
401	EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT								   401
	   ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
402	A BONEY HAND										  402
	   rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
403	ASH												 403
	   falls.
404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD								    404
	   is knocked from Ash's hand.
405	ASH												 405
	   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
	   and clutches his face.
406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
	   digs into Ash's mouth.  It jerks his face sideways to show
	   him...
407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS							   407
	   that rip from the ground!
408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
	   toss Ash to...
409	THE ROTTED ARMS									    409
	   grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.  Two of the six arms try
	   to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
	   at him.  Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
	   face toward the skeleton hands.
410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
	   curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
					   ASH
			   No.. no more...
	   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
					   ASH
			   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS								    411
	   last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
	   shutting Ash up.  With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
	   but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.  Both
	   hands work double-time at slapping him.
412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH									  412
	   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They
	   pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
413	ASH												 413

414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM					   414
	   The boney fist is thrust into Ash's screaming mouth up to the

	   They bulge as he swallow the arm.
416	STOP MOTION ANIMATION								   416
	   A ROTTED ARM
	   rips through the ground, punching Ash in the stomach.
417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM					   417
	   ASH
	   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to
	   the ground.
418	THE ARMS											 418
	   reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the
	   skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
					   ASH
				   (in a snarl)
			   Keep you damn filthy bones outta
			   my mouth.
	   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
	   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
	   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over
	   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
419	ASH CLIMBS										    419
	   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
420	EXT. CEMETARY - OLD OAK TREE							 420
	   The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
	   grave marker.
421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
	   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the
	   earth.
422	EVIL ASH'S BODY PARTS								   422
	   fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,
	   decayed version of EVIL ASH!
423	EXT. MILL - NIGHT									  423
	   ASH
	   stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip
	   from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!
424	A FEARFUL ASH										 424
	   kicks the horse and rides off.
425	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT							425

	   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
					   ASH
			   I'm through bein' their garbage

			   bargain.
	   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
			   Now they owe me.  Like in the
			   deal.  I want back.
	   He whips his horse...
			   HA!  GIIDDUP NOW!!
	   ...and rides off into the darkness.

			   The Necronomicon.  Quickly.
433	ASH												 433
	   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you bring the Necronomicon!
434	ASH												 434
	   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
	   Wiseman.
					   ASH
			   Yes. It's just that...
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Just what?!
					   ASH
			   Nothing. Here
	   Ash produces the Necronomicon.
			   Now send be back. Like in the
			   deal.
435	WISEMAN JOHN										  435
	   takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   No...I sensed something had gone
			   awry. The book's power. It's gone.
436	THE CROWD											436
	   murmurs at this bad news.
437	ASH												 437
	   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   When you removed the Necronomicon
			   from it's cradle, did you speak
			   the words?
					   ASH
			   Yeah.  basically.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you speak the exact words?!
					   ASH
			   Well, maybe not every single
			   syllable, no.  But basically I
			   said them.  Yes.
438	WISEMAN JOHN										  439
	   bows his head, stung by this information.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed
			   us. When thou misspoke the words
			   the Army of the Dead was awoke.
					   ASH
			   Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
			   you could clean this thing up,
			   once I got you the book. You said
			   there was a passage in there that
			   could get rid of this thing and
			   send me back.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The passage is useless to us as
			   long as these evil dead walk. They
			   have a terrible desire for this
			   book. And they shall come here
			   to get it. Once in their
			   possession, the Evil shall rule
			   the Earth for one thousand
			   years...Because of you...we are
			   doomed.
					   ASH
			   You wanted the damn book. You got
			   yer book. I did my part of the
			   deal.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   We did strike a bargain. I will
			   return you to your own time as
			   promised.
					   ASH
			   Yeah. Well good. That was the

	   doomed her.
					   ARTHUR
			   The Wisemen were fools to believe

			   That one such as you could have

442	ASH												 442
	   is solemn.
443	ARTHUR											   443

444	SHEILA											   444
	   moves closer.
					   SHEILA
			   I still believe that thou wilt

					   ASH
			   No.. They're right.  I screwed

			   and...  I'm sorry for it.
					   SHEILA
			   I still have faith in thee. In

					   ASH
			   Sheila... It's over for me. I
			   don't belong here and I'm going

			   How far from here?
					   SCOUT
			   But two days ride.
					   ARTHUR
			   Then these winged ones are only

					   WISEMAN
			   Perhaps we should go from this

			   Most of out people have already

					   ASH
			   We'll get Henry the Red and his

					   ARTHUR
			   We shall not stand in battle,

					   ASH
			   Then you'll die.  Honor and all.
			   Now who's with me?
464	THE CROWD											464
	   is silent as they consider Ash's words. Then from the rear, the

	   steps forward. Then another.

	   looks down at her with lust.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Why ain't you a sweet little

	   His boney digit caresses her lips.
					   SHEILA
			   Don't touch me!  You foul thing!

			   one that's gonna stop those
			   things.
	   Henry laughs.
					   HENRY
			   Why should I endanger my people
			   to save my enemy?
					   ASH
			   Because after they finish with
			   Arthur they'll come after you.
			   Together, we've got a chance.
			   Besides, you owe me.
477	EXT. A CRAGGY MOUNTAIN TOP - NIGHT						477
	   EVIL ASH AND SHEILA
	   ride side by side on skeletal steeds.  Sheila lifts her black
	   veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture
	   of cracked leather.  She looks with admiration to...
478	EVIL ASH											 478
	   He is general of the army of Deadites. He thrusts a rusted sword
	   into the air and shouts in a gritty voice:
					   EVIL ASH
			   Who rules?!
479	WIDE SHOT - ONE HUNDRED ARMORED SKELETONS				   479
	   raise their swords into the air with a shout.
480	EXT. CASTLE - DAY									  480
	   THREE TRUMPETERS
	   stand atop the castle wall and sound their trumpets!  CAMERA PANS
	   to reveal...
481	THE 1973 DELTA 88 OLDSMOBILE							 481
	   being pulled by a team of men and horses, inside the castle
	   walls.  Ash is behind the steering wheel.
482	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY					    482
	   ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH
	   look under the hood of the Delta 88, parked in the Blacksmith's
	   shop.
483	THE DELTA'S ENGINE									 483
	   is shattered.
484	ASH												 484
	   frowns.
485	ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH								  485
	   pour molten iron into a large sand mold.
486	THE SAND											 486
	   is brushed away revealing gear wheels.
487	HAMMERS											  487
	   beat upon red hot iron, fashioning helicopter like rotor blades.
488	THE BLACKSMITH'S STOVE								  488
	   is lowered into the Delta's engine compartment.
489	EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY							  489
	   ASH
	   walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who
	   stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard
	   at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash.
					   ASH
			   You eyeballin' me boy?
					   WARRIOR #9
			   No, M'Lord.
					   ASH
			   I can't hear you!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   NO, M'LORD!!
					   ASH
			   You squeekin' like a mouse!  Are
			   you a mouse boy?!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   NO, M'LORD!
					   ASH
			   Where you from, mouse?!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   I hail from the village of Perth.
					   ASH
			   Only two things come from Perth:
			   steers and queers. Which are you?
490	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									490
	   ASH
	   takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung.
	   He mixes them with sulfur.
491	THE BLACK POWDER									   491
	   is bound up in a small satchel and affixed to an arrow.
492	GOLD TOOTH										    492
	   lights the fuse with a torch.
493	ASH												 493
	   draws back and releases the arrow. ZING!
494	THE ARROW											494
	   imbeds in a wooden post and EXPLODES. Large pieces of wood are
	   sent flying.
495	ARTHUR'S WARRIORS									  495
	   watch in awe.
496	EXT. CASTLE LOOKOUT TOWER - DUSK						  496
	   THE CASTLE BELL

497	A WARRIOR											497
	   rides in through the castle gates screaming:
					   WARRIOR
			   They're coming!  The Deadites
			   approach!
498	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   498
	   A look of shock and fear on all the faces.  ASH comes into
	   frame.  CAMERA CRANES UP with him as he scales the ladder to
	   the lookout tower. He peers out to the darkening horizon.
499	ASH												 499
	   hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones.
	   Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching
	   armor.
500	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE HORIZON							   500
	   Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the
	   horizon.  Then fifty more.
501	EXT. BATTLEFIELD TRACKING SHOT						    501
	   THREE KILTED SKELETON SCOTSMEN

502	SKELETON #1										   502
	   plays the drums upon a set of hollow skulls.
503	SKELETON #2										   503
	   takes a leg bone upon a third skeleton's ribs. A bone xylophone.
	   A bone-o-phone.
504	SKELETON #3, #4 AND #5								  504
	   blow into arm bones forming woodwind section.
505	FOUR VIKING SKELETONS								   505
	   CAMERA TRACKING with these helmeted skeletons as they march.
	   They are clad in rusting suits of armor, wielding swords and
	   spears.  Nasty grins on their faces. One hobbles past on his
	   wooden leg.
506	EVIL ASH AND SHEILA									506
	   ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.
507	A SKELETON AND DEADITE CAPTAIN						    507
	   ride alongside Evil Ash and salute him sharply.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN
			   M'Lord!  We are positioned on both
			   fronts!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Where are they keeping my book?
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Most likely...there, in the
			   castle's keep. It would be the
			   safest place.  It is behind two
			   walls that must be taken first.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Excellent. Proceed.
508	SKELETON CAPTAIN #1									508
	   With a sweep of his arm, he waves the Army of rot.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Forward!
509	THE MACABRE MARCHING BAND							    509
	   now pound the attack beat on their drums.
510	A LINE OF DEADITES									 510
	   advance toward the castle. Some crouch behind wooden barricades
	   which they roll before them.
511	EXT. CASTLE - ATOP THE WALL							  511
	   ASH, ARTHUR AND THE WARRIORS
					   ASH
			   Arrows!
					   ARTHUR
			   Load!
512	TWELVE ARCHERS										512
	   pull back arrows on their bow strings.  Each arrow has a small
	   charge of black powder attached to it.
			   Torch boy!
513	A TORCH BOY										   513
	   runs behind the archers, lighting the fuses on each of the
	   powder charges. As the last arrow is lit....
514	ARTHUR											   514
	   looks to the approaching army.
515	THE LINE OF DEADITES								    515
	   rolls their wooden barricades closer.
516	ARTHUR											   516
	   turns to Ash for the signal.
517	ASH												 517
	   holds up a finger.  He waits.
518	TWELVE ARCHERS										518
	   strain, their bows taut with the explosive arrows.  The sound
	   of the FUSE BURNING is loud.
519	THE BURNING FUSES									  519
	   about to disappear into the powder charges.
520	ASH												 520
	   waits one more beat.  The turns to Arthur.
					   ASH
			   Fire!
					   ARTHUR
			   Fire!
521	TWELVE ARCHERS										521
	   fire a volley of smoking arrows.
522	SMOKING AND SPUTTERING ARROWS							522
	   rain down from the castle wall.
523	TWO WOODEN BARRICADES								   523
	   are hit with the explosive arrows. They explode.
524	THREE DEADITES										524
	   are pierced by the explosive arrows.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  They burst
	   apart in flames.
525	FLAMING DEADITES									   525
	   roll on the ground unable to extinguish themselves.
526	A BURNING SKELETON									 526
	   continues to advance only to collapse into a smoldering heap.
527	THE WARRIORS										  527
	   CHEER Ash in sensurround.
528	A SCOUT											  528
	   races up to Ash.
					   SCOUT
			   M'Lord!  A second division
			   approaching from the South.
529	ASH												 529
	   turns to the South.
530	A SECOND WAVE A DEADITES								530
	   approach.

	   hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults.
	   Their fuses are lit.
533	ASH												 533
	   gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of
	   black powder catapulting.
534	LONG SHOT - CASTLE									 534
	   Three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle
	   walls.
535	THREE FALLING SATCHELS P.O.V.'S						   535
	   CAMERA CRANING DOWN toward the skeletons as they look upward
	   in horror.
	   BOOM!  The first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider. Bones
	   fly.
	   BOOM!  FOUR DEADITES are obliterated.
536	EVIL ASH											 536
	   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You needn't bother.
537	EVIL ASH											 537
	   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
	   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You are now my captain. I will
			   now allow anything to stop me from
			   possessing the Necronomicon. Get
			   me into that castle.
538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
	   gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:
					   NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN
			   RAM THE GATES!
539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539
	   use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors
	   of the castle.
	   BOOM!-BOOM!
540	INT. CASTLE - THE CASTLE DOORS						    540
	   begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
541	TWO VILLAGE WOMEN									  541
	   scream!
542	TEN WARRIORS										  542
	   wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors.
543	EXT. CASTLE										   543
					   EVIL ASH
			   Arrows!
544	A ROW OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS							544
	   fire a volley of arrows. As they reload. Behind them...
545	A SECOND LINE OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS					  545
	   fire their arrows.
546	A VOLLEY OF DEADITES' ARROWS							 546
	   pierce five Warriors atop the castle wall. They fall.
547	INT. CASTLE										   547
	   TWO DEAD WARRIORS
	   fall to the courtyard. Villagers lift them away on stretchers.
548	ARTHUR											   548
	   shouts to Ash:
					   ARTHUR
			   Where is Henry?!
					   ASH
			   He'll be here.
					   ARTHUR
			   I think he will not. But know
			   this.  No matter how this battle
			   fares, I was wrong to think you
			   a coward.
549	EXT. CASTLE										   549
	   The battering rams rips through the doors and the army of
	   darkness pours into the courtyard.
550	A LEGLESS SKELETON									 550
	   crawls in with a knife in its teeth.
					   ARTHUR
			   They're coming in. What now?!
551	ASH												 551
	   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,
	   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling
	   the door closed behind him.
552	ARTHUR											   552
	   shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and
	   shouts:
					   ARTHUR
			   Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect
			   the book or God save us all!
553	THE WARRIORS										  553
	   retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the
	   parapet.
554	ARTHUR'S MEN CLIMB ATOP THE PARAPET					    554
	   The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.
555	INT. COURTYARD - SIX OF ARTHUR'S WARRIORS				   555
	   are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but
	   are quickly overcome.
556	EVIL SHEILA										   556
	   takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
557	EVIL ASH											 557
	   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
	   just beyond the parapet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   The book shall be mine!
	   He raises his rusty sword.
			   LADDERS!
558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD									   558
	   storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
	   large rocks rain down upon them from above.
559	TWO WARRIORS										  559
	   push away ladder #1.
560	FOUR SKELETONS ON LADDER #1							  560
	   swing away from the wall and crash to the ground.
561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2							   561
	   leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
562	WARRIOR #2										    562
	   knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
					   WARRIOR #2
			   We can't hold this wall much
			   longer!
563	A DEADITE ARROW									    563
	   pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
564	INT. COURTYARD										564
	   A VIKING DEADITE
	   looks up as he hears...
	   CHUG!  CHUG!  CHUG!
565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.									   565
	   THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
	   Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
	   beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
	   Behold...
566	THE DEATHCOASTER									   566
	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
	   is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
	   rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
568	ASH												 568
	   is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE						  569
	   SCREAMS to announce its birth.
570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
	   is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET						    571
	   cheer!
572	EVIL DEAD											572
	   at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
	   slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
	   pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
574	ASH												 574
	   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
	   the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
	   Thwop!  Thwop!  Two more skeletons bite the dust.
	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
577	EVIL SHEILA										   577
	   leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
					   EVIL SHEILA
			   Thou didst find me beautiful once.
					   ASH
			   Honey...You got real ugly.
578	EVIL SHEILA										   578
	   attacks with a SHRIEK!
579	ASH												 579
	   spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
	   Deadites.
580	ASH												 580
	   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
	   craft.
581	THE DEATHCOASTER									   581
	   careens out of control.
582	ASH												 582
	   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
583	THE DEATHCOASTER									   583
	   flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
584	ASH												 584
	   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
	   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
	   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
	   slices one end of it with his sword.
587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
	   plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
	   Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
	   parapet.
588	ASH												 588
	   looks to...
589	EVIL ASH											 589
	   approaching the Necronomicon.
590	ASH												 590
	   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
	   imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
592	ASH												 592
	   watches in horror as...
593	THE FLAMES RECEED									  593
	   revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
	   EVIL ASH!  It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.
	   CLANG!
	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
595	ASH'S SWORD										   595
	   imbeds in a wooden beam.
596	EVIL ASH											 596
	   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
597	ASH												 597
	   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
598	ANGLE ON											 598
	   WHOOSH!  KLANG!  WHOOSH!  KLANG!
	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
599	ANGLE ON											 599
	   KLANG!
	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
600	ABOVE...											 600
	   SKELETON ASH
	   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
	   downward, and Ash side steps it.
601	ASH												 601
	   rabbit punches CAMERA.
602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD								  602
	   Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
603	ASH												 603
	   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
	   a circle.
604	THE SKELETON										  604
	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
605	ASH												 605
	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
606	EVIL ASH											 606
	   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
	   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
607	SKELETON ASH										  607
	   Behold...
	   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
	   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
	   Keep.
608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH								   608
					   SKELETON ASH
			   You're finished.
	   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
					   SKELETON ASH
			   I possess the Necronomicon. I've
			   crushed your pathetic army. Now
			   I'll have my vengeance!
	   He raises his sword for the death blow...
609	THE SHRILL CALL OF BATTLE TRUMPETS						609
					   GUARD (O.S.)
			   Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
610	ASH AND THE SKELETON								    610
	   turn...
	   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
	   thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
	   courtyard to attack the Deadites!
612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612
	   turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
613	ASH												 613
	   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
	   Ash.
614	ASH												 614
	   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
	   through the rope, springing the catapult.
615	THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL						  615
	   are flung over the castle wall.
616	HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE						616
	   THE SKELETON PROJECTILE
	   rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning
	   satchel follows.
	   BOOM!  The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air.
	   A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
	   crush the last of the Deadites.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
617	GLORIOUS BEAMS OF MORNING SUNLIGHT						617
	   streak over the horizon. Ash enters frame. He holds the
	   Necronomicon as he looks wearily out over the battlefield.
618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING					  618
	   Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur's Warriors
	   work together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a
	   bonfire.
619	CLOSE SHOT - TWO DEADITE SKULLS						   619
	   engulfed by flames, crack in the heat.
									   DISSOLVE TO:

	   are dipped into the flame of a bonfire.  They ignite.
621	THE INTEGRATED ARMY OF HENRY AND ARTHUR'S MEN			    621
	   Form a row of archers.
	   They fire their flaming arrows toward the sea.
622	THE ARROWS										    622
	   strike a wooden ship that holds the body of Arthur.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure
			   we had our problems.  But in the
			   end, he was all right.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
623	EXT. SEASHORE - DUSK								    623
	   ASH AND THE OTHERS
	   watch the funeral pyre sail off.  It's flickering flames play
	   upon their faces.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
624	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							624
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Peace was made between the two
			   peoples.  And a new nation was
			   formed.  They offered my a chance
			   to stay among them and teach them.
			   A chance to lead them.  To be
			   King.  But Sheila was gone.
			   Besides, I had places to go.
	   FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
625	THE WISEMEN										   625
	   mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from

	   the Necronomicon.  A flask is dipped into the liquid.
	   WISEMAN JOHN
	   hands the flask of liquid to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Book tells us that each drop
			   allows a man to sleep a century.
			   Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
			   awaken in thine own time.
					   ASH (V.O.)

	   Ash takes the flask and studies it.

626	EXT. CASTLE - LONG SHOT - DAY							626
	   ASH
	   rides off.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I had to find a place to crash.
			   For a very long time.
627	EXT. CAVE - DAY									    627
	   ASH
	   with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the
	   cave.
	   He sets the horse free.
					   ASH
			   YAHH!!
	   It gallops off.
628	INT. CAVE - DAY									    628
	   ASH
	   Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He
	   ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I locked the door.
629	INT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE								  629
	   BOOM!
	   The powder charge blows.  The cave's entrance is sealed shut
	   with an avalanche of rock.
630	INT. CAVE - DEATHCOASTER								630
	   The car headlights come on, piercing the blackness.
631	INT. DEATHCOASTER									  631
	   ASH
	   uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I closed my eyes.
	   He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century
	   he must sleep.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I took a drink.
	   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A
	   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I didn't know if it was day or
			   night. I started... to get
			   drowsy... And I slept...
632	ASH												 632
	   falls into a deep slumber.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
633	THE DEATHCOASTER'S HEADLIGHTS							633
	   fade.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
634	CLOSER ON ASH'S SLEEPING FACE							634
	   now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.
					   ASH
			   ...And dreamed.
635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
	   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
	   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
	   Ash's wrist.
636	THE SUN											  636
	   rises then sets.
637	THE MOON											 637
	   follows.
638	A CRACK											  638

639	A BARREN TREE										 639
	   sprouts buds, they swell forming leaves which change to the

	   covers Ash.
641	ICICLES											  641
	   on the ceiling of the cave melt.  The water drops down onto
	   Ash's face.  He stirs.
642	ASH												 642
	   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
	   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
	   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
	   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams
	   into the hole he has created.
643	EXT. HILLSIDE										 643
	   ASH
	   climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   And when I awoke...
644	ASH												 644
	   beholds...
645	A FUTURISTIC CITY -									645
	   after the next Nuclear war: a dead land.
646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646
	   A FRACTURED CLOCK TOWER
	   lays sprawled on its side.  The time of mankind's death frozen
	   on the cracked face of the clock.
647	A SHATTERED BRIDGE									 647
	   abruptly ends, a third of the way across a river it once
	   spanned.  Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs
	   piled eight deep in some places.
	   CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces
	   of iron and bone.
					   ASH
			   ....I found that I had slept too
			   long.
648	ASH												 648
	   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't
	   hear his terrified SCREAM!

    FADE IN:


1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1
    A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun
    dips behind the mountains.

    In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the
    sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and
    very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an
    invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of
    transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve
    settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA
    ADJUSTS and reveals--


2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2
    Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur
    repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But
    now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long
    shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly
    from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If
    the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW
    MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with
    flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.

    As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE
    rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to
    enclose them all, he goes inside.


3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3
    This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a
    funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin
    curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering
    ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a
    neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM
    through the room and down the hallways lined with fading
    wallpaper.

                        VOICES
                  (various)
              --where did she go...? ... was
              here a moment ago... Cynthia, come
              on, honey, we need you... Cynthia,
              come out, come out wherever you
              are... the sun's going down, we're
              losing the moment...!

                                                                2.
    CONTINUED:             VOICES(CONT'D)
                 Hey, mellow out, we got ten
                 minutes, I like, checked the
                 almanac, okay...? Ready or not,
                 here we come...

    All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured
    tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage
    alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and
    opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys...
    and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky
    clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.

                            VOICES (CONT'D)
                 ...There you are, you naughty girl!
                 You almost made us lose the
                 sunset... Come on, honey, time's
                 wasting...

    She shrinks back from the HANDS that are pulling her up and
    out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet.
    The CAMERA stays with her as she's led back down the hallway.

                           CYNTHIA
                     (faintly)
                 No, please... I... I really don't
                 want to do this... Can't I just
                 wait for you..? I--I'm not sure
                 about this--

    A SET OF HANDS moves in, separates Cynthia from the others.

4   NEW ANGLE                                                        4
    Revealing VICTOR, a handsome youth a few years older than
    Cynthia.

                           VICTOR
                 Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to
                 do this, that's okay... right,
                 Harris?

    The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS
    across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet.

    In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we
    watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person
    steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing
    around are other people, some already dripping wet, others
    awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in
    varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off,
    slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris
    splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes
    his hair back.


                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                              3.
    CONTINUED: (2)

                            HARRIS
                 No, Victor, it's not okay. Here
                 at Unity House, some things have to
                 be done...
                     (slight smile)
                 ...in Unity. This is one of them.

    He WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia,
    Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a
    smile that inspires trust.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 Cynthia, do you trust me?

    She nods immediately.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 And have I ever lied to you?

    She shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia
    begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing;
    others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held
    by their parents and playfully splashed.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 Then I say to you now... to all of
                 you now... that this will be the
                 Ultimate Joining... of man and
                 woman... parent and child...
                 humanity and Godhead.

    He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go,
    gets in. Now only Cynthia remains.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 Cynthia. Come. There is no shame
                 in this. No crime. No sin. Just
                 the final break with the old
                 world... As night falls, we start
                 a new day... a day of Unity.
                     (a command, but warm)
                 Come to me... my lovechild.

5   ON CYNTHIA                                                     5
    His last words melt her remaining resistance. Moving like a
    sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she
    stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs
    her hand through it. Her eyes widen.
                                                               4.




6   EXT. HOUSE - LONG SHOT                                             6
    The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled
    windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this
    setting. It's beautiful.

                            CYNTHIA'S VOICE
              No!   No...

                         HARRIS' VOICE
              Cynthia, come back! We can't do it
              without you... We must have unity,
              my lovechild... Unity, now and
              through eternity... Cynthia, you
              cannot run... You belong to us
              forever--!

    Pause. The faint SOUNDS of SPLASHING and then FOOTSTEPS
    skittering on tired wooden floors... and then--

    --UNITY HOUSE EXPLODES!

7   EXPLOSION - ANOTHER ANGLE                                          7
    WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the
    air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave.
    Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and
    widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we
    HEAR SIRENS...

                                               CUT TO:


8   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - NIGHT                                           8
    FIRE is CONSUMING what's left of the building. Rescue
    workers and firefighters are running back and forth.

9   INSPECTOR WASSERMAN                                                9
    A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps
    around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his
    collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose
    connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din.

                        WASSERMAN
              What have we got?

                        POLICEMAN
              Twenty-four bodies, Inspector.
              Maybe more.

     CONTINUED:

     As he says this, both men watch as firefighters carry out a
     SCORCHED AND BLACKENED CORPSE that looks like a 3,000 year
     old mummy.

10   CORPSE - CLOSER                                                  10
     It's set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies
     partially covered by tarps. As the body is set down it
     CRUNCHES, and a piece BREAKS OFF.

11   BACK TO SCENE                                                    11
     Wasserman blanches, wipes his mouth.

                            WASSERMAN
                  Cause of fire?

                            OFFICER
                  Some kind of explosion... gas main,
                  methane, too soon to tell. God
                  only knows.

                            WASSERMAN
                  Let's hope He doesn't keep it to
                  Himself.

                            A VOICE
                  We got one! We got a survivor! Get
                  a stretcher and oxygen over here,
                  STAT!

     Wasserman and the cop run up the slope with the others.

12   RUINS - CLOSER                                                   12
     Medics run around the parked VW, which drips water and
     chemical foam. Rescue workers move a FALLEN BEAM and pull a
     soot-blackened form out of a hole. As the CAMERA PUSHES
     closer, we see that it is Cynthia. Her clothes are torn and
     singed, and she is unconscious, but as they work on her we
     see that she is largely unharmed.

     Wasserman tries to keep up as they carry her on a stretcher
     towards an ambulance, put her inside. It ROARS AWAY, SIREN

     We SEE Cynthia in her bad, always in the same near-fetal
     position. The only changes are the occasionally different
     hues of her blankets and the varying length of her hair.

15   INT. HOSPITAL NURSE'S STATION - DAY                             15
     The HEAD NURSE looks up, smiles at a YOUNG FLOOR NURSE as she
     walks past. From somewhere we HEAR a Springsteen song on the
     radio.

                         HEAD NURSE
               Debbie. What happened to your
               windsurfing lesson?

                         YOUNG NURSE
               No wind. I changed shifts with
               Nancy.
                   (picking up charts)
               Well... time to weed the vegetable
               patch.

     We FOLLOW the young nurse as she goes into--

     Bored, the nurse goes to the foot of the bad, checks the
     chart there. She moves past MONITORING EQUIPMENT which shows
     only subtle movement. As she begins to take Cynthia's blood
     pressure, CAMERA CONTINUES ON INTO THE BED and we see
     Cynthia,

     She is now a fully grown young woman in her late 20's.   She
     is curled up in a fetal ball.

17   THE YOUNG NURSE                                                 17
     finishes her work and then gathers some bottles from the side
     table. She goes to the door and then REACTS to a SOUND.

     She looks around, puzzled. Meanwhile, we SEE (and she
     DOESN'T) that there is INCREASED ACTIVITY on the monitors.

                         CYNTHIA
                   (faint, weak)
               No... no... it's wrong...

                         YOUNG NURSE
               Holy shit...

     Stunned, the nurse DROPS the bottles with a CRASH.
     Recovering her composure, she darts back to the bed, watches
     flabbergasted as Cynthia continues to STIR, her arms weakly
     battling half-realized fears.

                  Is that like a world record for a

                  Actually, no. The longest one on
                  record is 37 years.

     The first reporter closes a notebook, leaves.

     Lieutenant (née Inspector) Wasserman is there.    He's grayer,

                  neuromuscular problems a patient
                  like this will encounter as well as
                  the inevitable mental readjustment

     Cynthia is standing inside a set of parallel bars. She's
     pale, weak looking. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST is at her elbow,
     egging her on.

                            THERAPIST
                  Good... Very good... Come on,
                  just a few more steps...

     Cynthia blinks, as if just processing the therapist's word
     takes some adjustment.

                  Young lady, you've had fifteen
                  years of rest.

     CAMERA ADJUSTS to show DR. BERRISFORD. In his 50's,
     avuncular, he wears half-framed glasses and a sweater vest
     under his medical coat. Two pieces of tissue paper mark his
     razor's passage on his neck.

             Now walk to the end of that
             platform, or you won't got any
             chocolate ice cream.

Something about Berrisford's mock-stern tone bores in on
Cynthia, gets a reaction. She gropes for an answer.

                       CYNTHIA
                 (finally)
             I... I hate chocolate ice cream.

             Then walk to the end of the
             platform, or I'll shove an entire
             gallon down your throat.

Cynthia's eyes crinkle with confusion. And then, ah, she
gets it! A joke, the first one in over a decade. She
SMILES, and it's a beautiful smile. Setting her jaw, she
makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform.
The therapist and Berrisford both move quickly to catch her
and set her down in a wheelchair.

                       BERRISFORD
                 (to the therapist)
              That'll be all.

Berrisford begins wheeling Cynthia along. They leave the
therapy room, go down a corridor. (Note: Passage as per
location.) As they go by other patients and staff, there's a
general BUZZ as people whisper about Cynthia.

             Am I supposed to know you or
             something?

             I've looked in on you from time to
             time... but that's hardly an
             introduction. You've been

               you say you were?

     Berrisford notices one of the tissues on his neck.    Scowls,
     flicks it away.

                         BERRISFORD
               Obviously, I'm not a surgeon.
                   (as she laughs)
               I'm a psychiatrist.

               Why do I need a psychiatrist?

                          BERRISFORD
               Cynthia, you've been out of touch
               with reality for over ten years.
               Your recovery goes beyond your
               muscle tone... You have to ease
               into life... into interacting with
               other people again. Into a world
               that's changed so much that
               sometimes I get confused by it.

     She can't help but listen as they continue in lowered tones.

                            WASSERMAN
                  I've waited fifteen years. That's
                  long enough. Now I want to speak
                  with Miss Weston.

                            BERRISFORD
                  Miss Weston is still recovering and
                  is in no condition for a prolonged
                  interrogation.

                            WASSERMAN
                      (tight smile)
                  Then don't prolong it. I'll be
                  brief with her, I'll be gentle with
                  her--

                            BERRISFORD
                  I'll let you know when she's ready--

     They turn and look at her.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               Doctor Berrisford, what's this all
               about...? This man wants to talk
               to me...?

     Berrisford starts to answer, but Wasserman rushes in.

                         WASSERMAN
                   (quietly, slowly, as if to
                    a child)
               That's right, Miss Weston. I just
               have a few easy, simple questions.
                   (patient, phony smile)
               About you... and about Unity House.

     Cynthia looks at him strangely, turns to Berrisford.

                         CYNTHIA
                   (sotto)
               Why is he talking like that? Is he
               one of your patients?

     Wasserman burns.   Berrisford LAUGHS.

                         BERRISFORD
               Lieutenant Wasserman is a police
               officer. And the word "patience"
               isn't part of his vocabulary.

     Wasserman scowls, not enjoying being the butt of a joke.    He
     resumes his normal tons, which is far from diplomatic.

                         WASSERMAN
               Miss Weston. What's the last thing
               you remember before...

                         CYNTHIA
               --Before the accident?   Nothing.

                         WASSERMAN
               Then how do you know it was an
               accident?

           Harris, he was the leader?

Cynthia's eyes are far away.    The memories come back...   the
words are slow, but vivid.

She winces, rubs her eyes.

                    CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, that's all I can see.

                    WASSERMAN
          Miss Weston. This "Unity House"...
          was it a cult?

                       CYNTHIA
          I'm sorry.     I don't understand the
          question.

                    BERRISFORD
          A "cult," Cynthia. A syndrome of
          society you have been fortunate
          enough to miss. They're popular
          with impressionable people, the
          penny press...
              (pause)
          ...and lazy policemen who like to
          blame them for crimes they can't
          solve.

Wasserman closes his notebook, gives Berrisford a cold stare.

                    WASSERMAN
          I was there that night, Doctor. I
          watched them stack those bodies...

     Cynthia gasps.

               If it was an accident... fine. If

               And he's probably as interested in
               Miss Weston's memory as I am.

     He turns, nods to Cynthia.

                         WASSERMAN (CONT'D)
               Feel better.

     He goes out.   Cynthia's breath comes in short gasps.   Finally
     she calms.

                         CYNTHIA
               I don't like that man.

                         BERRISFORD
               That makes two of us.

     He sits beside her again.

               But as long as you're here...

wheelchair into the room and into a place in the circle.

RALPH stands. Long-haired, with the staccato delivery of a
stand-up comic, he smiles.

                       RALPH
             Well, now that we're all here, we
             can begin. Cynthia, I'm Dr.
             Goldman, and I'd like to welcome
             you to our little group. I don't
             know how much my colleague Dr.
             Berrisford has told you about my
             methods. I have my detractors...
             but I have my successes, too!
             We're going to get you out of your
             depression... We're going to got
             you out of your neurosises...
             We're going to got you out of that
             hideous hospital robe and into a
             flimsy revealing negligee--one with
             the little holes here? I can see
             us now on a desert island... You,
             me, a portable waterbed--

As Cynthia's eyes widen, DR. ALAN GOLDMAN comes into the
room, sighs with weary familiarity at Ralph's antics.
(Actually, Alan doesn't look much more like a doctor than
Ralph.)

          A borderline personality is one
          that can't be accurately placed on
          the Neurosis-Psychosis arc. As a
          personality syndrome it encompasses
          identity crises, chemical
          addictions, emotionalism, anxiety-

He sits, smiles sweetly.

                    CONNIE
          He also forgot suicidal tendencies.
          But, as one whose previous
          reincarnations stretch back to
          Ancient Atlantis, well, suicide is
          meaningless anyway.

           their egos, they would experience
           a... togetherness. A... oneness.
           A Unity. That's where the name
           came from. We had a dream about a
           perfect society based on trust. On
           love. On totally committed
           togetherness. We weren't trying to
           change the whole world. We were
           just trying to change each other.

Pause.   Everyone is affected by her sincerity.

                 Am I missing something, or what?

                           BERRISFORD
                 She's espousing a total belief
                 system. A kind of holistic healing
                 matrix not unlike the dynamic
                 energy shift model. Isn't that
                 interesting? They're adopting it,
                 embracing it.

                           ALAN
                 Too bad we can't follow through on
                 this.

                            BERRISFORD
                 Why not?

                            ALAN
                  Dr. Berrisford, the people in this
                  group... some of them are deeply
                  disturbed. Cynthia doesn't belong
                  with them-- an experiment for one
                  session, fine, but in the long run--

                            BERRISFORD
                  Alan. We've opened primary
                  channels of communication. You've
                  opened them, Alan. Let's not rush
                  to throw away our progress.
                  Neuroses are hardly contagious. A
                  few weeks in the group won't hurt
                  Cynthia. With luck, she'll
                  overcome her memory trauma. That
                  would mean progress... not to
                  Mention getting Lieutenant
                  Wasserman off my back. In the
                  meantime...

     He stands, puts his hand on the younger man's shoulder.

                            BERRISFORD (CONT'D)
                  She seems to like you. See if you
                  can get her to open up, and let's
                  press on.
                      (pause)
                  With a united front?

                            ALAN
                  A united front.   Sure.

     Satisfied, Berrisford smiles, goes out the door.     Alan sighs,
     and looks at Cynthia's image on the screen.

                                                CUT TO:


29   INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - DAY                                   29
     Patients in different stages of fitness use the equipment,
     some with supervision, others on their own. HETTIE,
     Berrisford's chief nurse--a Selma Diamond type--comes in with
     a tray of medication in paper cups. She works her way over
     to where

     warmers, and there's real color in her face for the first
     time.

             Drop down to first gear, honey.
             It's Miller time.

She fumbles on her tray for the cup marked "Weston," hands
the pills to Cynthia along with a cup of juice.

                       CYNTHIA
             What are these? Vitamins?

                       HETTIE
             Beauty secrets from the orient.
             Look what they've done for me.

Cynthia laughs, takes the pills. Hettie moves over to Ralph,
who's just finished doing bench presses.

                       HETTIE
             Ralph, you in a cooperative mood,
             or do I have to tie you up again?

                       RALPH
             Promises, promises.

He takes the pills she gives him, smiles.      She just looks at
him, taps his mouth.

                        HETTIE
             Open.

Of course the pills are still under his tongue. Hettie gives
him a shot in the solar plexus and he GULPS. Hettie hands
him the juice.

                       HETTIE (CONT'D)
             Next time I hit lower.

She moves on to other patients.     Ralph moves over to Cynthia.

                       RALPH
             She's crazy about me.
                 (watching Cynthia's
                  workout)
             You're coming along. A regular
             Rocky.

                        CYNTHIA
             Rocky?   The flying squirrel?

                       RALPH
              Rocky the fighting Stallone.

CONTINUED: (2)      RALPH(CONT'D)
          I keep forgetting you just left the
          Twilight Zone. Hey, why don't you
          come up to my room, and I'll bring
          you up to date. I've got a VHS
          VCR, a CD, and MTV.

                    CYNTHIA
          You're making this up...      aren't
          you?

He just grins. She slips down to the floor, does some
stretching exercises.

                    CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          Sounds like a complicated world.
          How do you handle it?

                    RALPH
          Well, whenever it gets to be too
          much, I just let all of the
          negative stuff out of my body.

                    CYNTHIA
          You mean with meditation, yoga,
          what?

                    RALPH
          Nah. I just make a little hole and
          let it all escape.

He pulls open his shirt. On his chest and arms are dozens of
scars in neat little rows.

Cynthia swallows, stunned.      Nonplussed, Ralph buttons back
up.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          Uh-uh, here comes the assistant
          Ayatollah. See ya.

As Ralph exits, Cynthia looks around, puzzled.

                    CYNTHIA
          "Ay-a-toll-ah..?"

Then she sees Alan.

                    ALAN
          Buy you some lunch?

                      CYNTHIA
          Sure.

     He starts to help her up.   She pushes him off gets up with a
     theatrical hop.

                         ALAN
               I'm impressed.

     They walk out of the therapy room.

                         CYNTHIA
               Impressed enough to call me a cab?

                         ALAN
               I'm not sure I follow you.

                         CYNTHIA
               I've been talking to Ralph. He
               told me about his... personal
               therapy program.
                   (as Alan winces)
               And I've been watching the
               others... Dr. Goldman, they belong
               here. I don't.


31   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY                                              31
     They pass Lana and Miriam who are swallowing medication from
     Hettie's tray. The two women patients wave at Cynthia, who
     smiles.

                         ALAN
                   (as they walk)
               Please, call me Alan. Doctor
               Goldman is my father...
                   (thinking)
               ...and my grandfather. I think my
               first baby toy was a stethoscope--

                         CYNTHIA
               You're changing the subject...
                   (trying it out)
               --Alan. I'm feeling stronger. I'm
               getting used to things like VC
               esses and MCDs. I want to leave.

                   (carefully)
               Your parents died when you were a
               child. We haven't been able to
               locate any relatives.

     He stops at the elevator doors, hits the button.

                  I guess I'd just look up some of
                  the old hands from Unity House...
                  crash with them for a while...
                      (thinking)
                  ...do people still say "crash"--?

                  Cynthia...
                      (gently)
                  There aren't any old hands left.
                  The fire that injured you...? It
                  took everyone also with it.
                  They're all gone.

     Cynthia reacts as if struck...    has to loan against the wall
     to catch her breath.

                             CYNTHIA
                  I knew there were deaths...   but...
                  everybody?

                            ALAN
                  I'm afraid so. Look, Cynthia...
                  I'm not saying this to upset you,
                  but the sooner you realize that
                  that whole phase of your life is
                  over, and move on, the better off
                  you're going to be. Why don't you
                  bring this into the open... talk
                  about it in group? Oh, here's our
                  ride.

     Saying this, he turns as an elevator OPENS.      It's pretty
     crowded. He holds the door for her.

                            CYNTHIA
                      (confused)
                  Talk about it...?

     Seeing he's waiting, she straightens, moves into the
     elevator.

             here?

The doors CLOSE. Everyone huddles in the compact space
silently, politely. The elevator heaves into movement.     It
HUMS as it whisks down the shaft.

The overhead fluorescent light in the car is weak.    It
flickers off and on momentarily.

                       ALAN
             Nobody ever said it would be easy.
             And it works for a lot of people.

             Can't you at least transfer me...
             get me in a group of people with
             problems a little more like mine--

             Cynthia, we don't have a lot of
             patients who've been in a coma for
             over a decade!

The light gets weaker. Finally it just goes out.     There is a
general SIGH of annoyance from the passengers.

The light FLICKERS on every few seconds giving off the effect
of a strobe light.

                       A PASSENGER
             You'd think with what they charge
             here they could pay their electric
             bills

LAUGHTER.

                       CYNTHIA
             Relax. They're probably giving
             shock therapy.
                 (for Alan's benefit)
             "It works for most people".

More LAUGHTER. Then Cynthia is RIVETED by the sight of
something across the elevator.

     Staggered, disbelievingly, she moves behind Alan, looks over
     to the far corner again.

     Another FLASH. Harris is gone. Suddenly the ELEVATOR JERKS
     TO A HALT, but the doors DON'T OPEN. Passengers GROAN,
     annoyed.

                            PASSENGER
                  Oh, great--

     The emergency BELL starts sounding. Cynthia, still confused,
     gets shoved against the back wall as the passengers busy
     themselves pushing buttons.

     Cynthia bumps into the man next to her.        She looks up at him.

     FLASH.   It is Harris.

     FLASH. Harris reaches out to Cynthia. She CRIES OUT, jerks
     away, slamming into Alan, falling to the floor.

     Someone is on the floor right across from her.

     FLASH.   It's Harris.    His face is burned and skeletal.     He
     GRINS.

                  Unity, Cynthia...   Now and forever!

     He has no eyelids or lips. Cynthia SCREAMS, struggles to her
     feet, knocking over another passenger. Now it's chaos in
     here.

     Cynthia literally TUMBLES out of the elevator, staggers along
     the wall, holding herself up. Alan runs out to aid her. The
     passengers get off the elevator, looking at her oddly. A
     CUSTODIAN runs up and turns off the alarm.

               It's him!     It's him!   He's alive--

                         ALAN
               Who's alive?

                         CYNTHIA
                   (pointing)
               He's alive! Right over--

     She stops. The elevator is open and empty. The passengers
     watch her, some concerned, some voyeuristic. Now they drift
     away.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                   (weakly)
                --there...

     Alan just stares at her.

                                                 CUT TO:


36   INT. BERRISFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                    36
     Berrisford sits, listens intently to Alan.

             --hallucination, flashback, I don't
             know what to call it-

                       BERRISFORD
             How about psychotic episode?

                       ALAN
             No, no, she doesn't fit the
             pattern--

                       BERRISFORD
             Addictive personalities can be
             borderline. You know that--

                       ALAN
                 (patiently)
             She has no history of drug abuse--

                       BERRISFORD
             There's other kinds of addictions.
                 (standing, pensive)
             we see it in these fringe religious
             groups... these instant creeds
             with pseudo-Messianic delusions.
             You've heard how she talks about
             Unity House? Perhaps that's her
             drug. Perhaps she's going through
             a--withdrawal of sorts. Her memory
             lapses about Unity House are
             equally symptomatic... There's
             some violent turmoil under that
             pretty little facade.

                       ALAN
                 (skeptical)
             You put her in the Borderline Group
             and she became one?

                       BERRISFORD
             No.

CAMERA TIGHTENS ON HIM.

                       BERRISFORD (CONT'D)
             I believe she went into that coma
             a disturbed young lady. Fifteen
             years later... nothing has
             changed.

37   INT. ENTRANCE - BERRISFORD CLINIC WING - NIGHT                  37
     We can read the name on the locked security door (albeit
     backwards.) A SECURITY GUARD watches a basketball game on a
     portable set.


38   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     38
     This is not the room we saw when she was comatose, but a
     brighter, more residential arrangement. Cynthia sits on the
     bed, watches as Hettie counts out pills for her. Cynthia
     swallows them, hesitates at a red one.

                         CYNTHIA
               This one's new.

                         HETTIE
               It'll help you sleep.
                   (explaining)
               Sort of a post-elevator cocktail?

     Cynthia scowls, takes it. Hettie goes out. Cynthia lies
     down on the bed, stiff. Turns over once or twice. Sighing,
     she picks up the TV remote, shakes her head at the myriad
     buttons. Finally she finds the right one, CLICKS IT.

39   TV - HER P.O.V.                                                 39
     She's come in on the middle of a group therapy scene from THE
     BOB NEWHART SHOW. (NOTE: Or maybe THE SNAKE PIT or SHOCK
     CORRIDOR?)

40   BACK TO SCENE                                                   40
     She watches until she realizes what it is, then CLICKS it
     off.


41   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   41
     Hettie leans over the security guard's desk. The guard
     GROANS in frustration an the basketball game ends.

                         HETTIE
                   (extending her hand)
               Pay up. Twenty bucks.

     Neither notices a DARK FIGURE passing by close to the CAMERA.
                                                               33.




42   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     42
     Cynthia lies restlessly in her bed. She hears footsteps
     coming closer. They stop at her door. She looks over.

     There is a SHADOW moving in the crack under the door.   The
     doorknob TURNS. Cynthia sits up.

                         CYNTHIA
               Who's there?

     She reaches for the button to call the nurse, but then the
     door is OPEN, and the figure stands there silhouetted.

                         FIGURE
                   (whisper)
               Cynthia?

     The figure comes forward. Cynthia backs off the other side
     of the bed and turns on a light.

     It is Victor, the boy we remember from the opening scene.
     The years have been kind to him. He stands there, the dim
     light spilling on his Army field jacket and bell-bottomed
     jeans.

                          VICTOR
               Cynthia?   It's me.   Victor.

                         CYNTHIA
                   (amazed)
               Vic? Oh, my God--

     She practically leaps across the room, hugs him with all her
     strength.

                         VICTOR
               Look at you.
                   (marveling)
               Little Cyn.
                   (impressed)
               Not so little anymore.

                         CYNTHIA
               Vic, this is just... fantastic,
               it's the most incredible...
                   (hesitating)
               But... how can you be here?

                          VICTOR
               Yeah.   It is after visiting hours--


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                  I mean... they said that...      that
                  everybody died.

                            VICTOR
                      (smiling)
                  Do I look like a ghost to you?

                            CYNTHIA
                      (rapid-fire)
                  How did you survive? How did you
                  find me? Is anyone else--

                            VICTOR
                  Whoa, whoa. It's a long story...
                      (looking around)
                  Let me tell it somewhere else. I
                  feel like I'm in, like, the
                  Pentagon or something.

     Cynthia grins, grabs a light jacket.

                            CYNTHIA
                  Then let's go AWOL.


43   INT. HALLWAY                                                   43
     Victor peeks out the door. An orderly passes, then
     disappears. Victor and Cynthia tiptoe out, sprint down the
     corridor to a stairwell marked "EXIT", and they are gone.


44   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                       44
     Victor takes her hand, and they run towards a battered VW
     van. We recognize it and its slogans.

                             CYNTHIA
                  Zeke!   You've still got Zeke!

     She runs her hand along the dusty side lovingly, and then
     they hop inside.

45   ON THE REAR LICENSE PLATE                                      45
     Rusted, dated 1973.     The van DRIVES AWAY.

46   EXT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   46
     It's a tacky but cozy building, circa 1958. "Zeke" pulls up,
     rattling to a coughing halt. They get out, head up the
     steps.


47   INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   47
     They come in, turning on lights. It's a dingy couple of
     rooms, but lush with its variety of objects. Everything
     looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag
     furniture, paper "Tiffany" shades on hanging lights,
     blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters.

     Cynthia loves the room and everything in it. But she is
     particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner.

48   PAINTING - HER POV                                                48
     It's of her, sitting serenely in a meadow, the Unity House
     perched prominently on a hill in the distance. (In the
     doorway, the bare-chested FIGURE of a man may--or may not--be
     barely visible.) Cynthia's clothes in the painting are the
     ones she wore in the opening scene.

     But her face is that of today's Cynthia.

49   BACK TO SCENE                                                     49
                         VICTOR
               I... did it by memory. I tried to
               imagine... what you'd... look
               like today. Guess I came pretty
               close.

                         CYNTHIA
               It's beautiful. More beautiful
               than I ever was.

                         VICTOR
                   (softly)
               Then you need a new mirror.

     she smiles, flattered.    Suddenly a CAT jumps up on a crate.

                         VICTOR (CONT'D)
               That's Chairman Meow.

     Cynthia picks him up.    Victor takes out a bottle of tequila
     and two glasses.

                  You still haven't told me how you
                  lived. I really can't remember
                  anything about the... accident.

                            VICTOR
                  It wasn't an accident.

     She stiffens.    His eyes are far away.

                            VICTOR (CONT'D)
                  A lot of people back then, they
                  hated Unity House. Hated Harris
                  and his dreams... dreams of
                  peace... of oneness. That hate
                  fed negative energy into the cosmic
                  vortex... Something bad was bound
                  to happen. That hate was so
                  strong... so envious of what we
                  had...

     He has SQUEEZED the shot glass in his hand so hard that it
     EXPLODES. Cynthia JUMPS, and that's when he notices it.

                             VICTOR (CONT'D)
                      (very normal)
                  Oh, fuck--

                            CYNTHIA
                  You've cut yourself--

     She comes over, binds his hand with a dishcloth.     He holds
     onto her.

                            VICTOR
                  I guess talking about the past can
                  be a little dangerous.

     He pours a shot into the remaining glass.

                            VICTOR (CONT'D)
                  Let's drink to the present.
                      (pause)
                  To us.

     He SIPS.   Passes the glass to her.

50   CYNTHIA                                                            50
     She hesitates...    smiles.   Drinks.

     There is a drop of blood in the glass.     She doesn't see it.

                   (quietly)
               To... Unity.

     He pulls her close. They KISS... she seems to malt in his
     grasp. The cat jumps down. Slowly they kiss and touch each
     other. They stop and stare into each other's eyes.

     He moves his hand over her shoulders, neck, through her hair.
     She is completely his.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:


52   INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                                    52
     Half a dozen candles illuminate the room.

     Cynthia and Victor are making love. Not violent, but slow,
     passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each
     other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into
     each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost.

     Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases,
     as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving,
     gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax.

     But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very
     threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed.

                           VICTOR
               Oh Jesus!

                           CYNTHIA
               Victor?

     Victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the
     walls.

                         VICTOR
               Oh, my God. I can't believe it.
               What a great idea...! Too amazing!
               Too amazing!

                         CYNTHIA
               Is something wrong?

             Not wrong, Cynthia...right! The
             most right thing in the world!

He goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box. He holds it
with a coy expression, like a kid hiding a frog. Cynthia's
annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his
exuberance. Their tone with each other remains loving,
kidding.

                       CYNTHIA
             Are you going to tell me your
             little secret, or should I just got
             dressed?

                       VICTOR
             I'm sorry, Cyn, but I just got the
             most incredible idea. It's
             absolutely beautiful! Do you want
             to know what it is?

                          CYNTHIA
                    (exasperated)
             Yes!

He sits on the bad.

                       VICTOR
             I was just thinking about what we
             were doing here together...

             I should hope so...

                       VICTOR
             Wouldn't it be incredible if, right
             at the perfect moment right when
             we're coming, if we did it?

                          CYNTHIA
             Did what?

                       VICTOR
             What we were meant to do, of
             course.

                       CYNTHIA
                 (puzzled)
             ...meant to do...?

          That sunset. That last night.      At
          Unity House. Remember?

                       CYNTHIA
          No...     No, Victor, I don't...

                    VICTOR
              (distant)
          They all got to go. You and me...
          we got left behind... while they
          went on.
              (chuckling)
          Guess that's why they say life
          ain't fair. Well...

He opens the box.    Inside it are TWO PISTOLS.

                    VICTOR (CONT'D)
          --we can fix that.

                    CYNTHIA
              (stiffening)
          My God, Victor! Put those away--

He ignores her, checks the cylinder on the revolver, the clip
on the automatic.

                    VICTOR
          This is so great! I mean, I've
          been living with all this shit,
          thinking about you, searching...
          going nowhere. And you, hell, you
          don't fit in with Ralph and Miriam,
          those other flakes... Berrisford
          and Goldman, they're a waste of
          time--

                    CYNTHIA
          H-how do you know about them? I
          never--

He SLAMS the clip home, CLOSES the cylinder.

                    VICTOR
          Yeah. We had the answers, way back
          then. Unity. Unity, now and
          forever. Cynthia, this is our
          second chance!

She shrinks away from him on the bed. He bounces closer like
a kid at a pajama party, holds out one of the pistols.

                    VICTOR (CONT'D)
          Okay, you do me, and I'll do you--
          but wait until I say go! Hey, get
          rid of the sheet... Let me see
          that grown up body...

He grins, puts the gun to her head and gets an top of her.

                    CYNTHIA
          No, Vic. Please.       Please!   I don't
          want to do this!

                    VICTOR
          Yes, you do. You know you do.

                     CYNTHIA
          No!

He's holding her down.   He's getting into it.

                    VICTOR
          Oh, Cynthia, it's so beautiful.

                    CYNTHIA
          God, God, no--

                    VICTOR
          We're on the edge of space and
          time.

He spreads her legs under the sheets. She's struggling
against him, but it's no use. He's too strong. He's coming
closer.

                    VICTOR (CONT'D)
          Oh, good... good... ummm...
          ummm...
              (continuing)
          Cynthia, it's happening. Put the
          gun to my head.

                    CYNTHIA
          Jesus, Vic, no!

                    VICTOR
          Yeah, oh yeah...     oh, YEAH--

A SHOT sounds.   She SCREAMS--

                                             CUT TO:
                                                                 41.




53   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                                53
     Cynthia BOLTS up out of bed.

                            CYNTHIA
               No!

     The candles are out.    Victor isn't in the room.

     Cynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath.      She
     looks around, confused.

                            CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               Vic?

     She goes into the other room.


54   INT. LIVING ROOM                                                    54
     No Vic. It is dark except for a FIRE in the fireplace. The
     flames REFLECT oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting
     of Unity House.

                            CYNTHIA
               Vic?

     She checks in the kitchen. Nothing.       She looks back in the
     bedroom. The apartment is empty.

     She's just calming when--MEEOW! The CAT LEAPS out of
     nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight.

     She swallows. Very nervous now, she sits on the couch and
     starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. The CAMERA MOVES
     AROUND her, revealing the entire apartment. We see EVERY
     ANGLE. It is completely quiet and still. The CAMERA SETTLES
     at one ANGLE on Cynthia. A shadow behind her MOVES.

                         VICTOR
               Where are you going?

     Cynthia JUMPS from fright.

                         CYNTHIA
               Jesus, Vic. I thought you... left.

                           VICTOR
               Me?    Leave you all alone?

     He pulls her into his arms.      She hesitates.

                            VICTOR
                  That...
                      (kissing her)
                  ...has to be..
                      (kissing again)
                  ...the stupidest question I ever
                  heard...

     He keeps kissing, caressing.

                            CYNTHIA
                  I mean... with... life.   With...
                  being alive.

     He looks at her oddly.

                            VICTOR
                  What are you talking about?

                            CYNTHIA
                      (relaxing)
                  Never mind... I had this...
                  bizarre dream...

                            VICTOR
                  Welcome to reality.

     He touches her soft face. He runs his hands down her neck.
     They kiss again, she now completely without reservation.
     Their embrace is so all-encompassing that, when she opens her
     eyes, it's only then that she SEES

55   CLOSER                                                             55
     She is kissing a BURNED AND SCARRED FACE WITH ONLY CLUMPS OF
     PUPPY BLACK MUSCLE HANGING ON THE BONE. It is Harris' face,
     the face we saw in the elevator. Cynthia GASPS, fumbles
     backwards off of the sofa.

                            VICTOR (CONT'D)
                  What's the matter?

     She looks back up at him.     He's Victor again, normal again.

                             VICTOR (CONT'D)
                  Cynthia?

     She knocks over a tequila bottle. It's spilled all over the
     floor. She is speechless. He picks the bottle up.

               I...    I think I'd better go.

                           VICTOR
               Why?

     She's over by the door.    Victor comes and presses against it
     so she can't get out.

                         CYNTHIA
               Please let me out.

                         VICTOR
               I don't understand...    What did I
               do?

                        CYNTHIA
               Nothing. It's not you, it...     it's
               me. I just want to go.

                         VICTOR
               You know, maybe you belong in that
               clinic, because this, this is
               crazy! We were having a good time--
                   (on her look)
               I'm sorry. Look, what we were
               feeling... it was special.

     She softens--

                         VICTOR (CONT'D)
               --it was Unity.
                   (distantly)
               Unity, Now and through Eternity...
               Cynthia, you cannot run...

     That does it.    Pale, she scrabbles at the doorknob, opens it,
     runs out.

                          VICTOR (CONT'D)
               You cannot run... You belong to us

57   THE APARTMENT--HER POV                                            57
     Victor is in the window waving, firelight dancing behind him.
     The reflection on the glass makes the painting on the wall
     look totally aflame.

     ETHEREAL SITAR MUSIC UP OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:


58   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                              58
     Cynthia has her thumb out as the cars whizz by.     One stops.


59   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                                  59
     A sweaty-looking DRIVER eyes Cynthia.   She just looks off,
     depressed and afraid.


60   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAWN                                           60
     She gets out of the car and goes in the main entrance.


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAWN                                      61
     She makes her way to her room looking tired, distraught.


62   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - DAY                                         62
     She lies on her bed, exhausted, trying to sleep.     She can't.
     She gets out of bad.


63   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                       63
     She's looking for an office. She goes in one marked Dr.
     Goldman. He looks up from his coffee, sees her ashen
     expression... pulls out a chair. Listens as the words
     tumble out. His expression changes... to skepticism... and
     then, as she breaks down SOBBING, to concern. He holds
     her... thinks...

     ...reaches for his car keys.

64   INT. ALAN'S CAR - DAY                                               64
     They are travelling along the highway.      Cynthia POINTS.   He
     turns onto another street.


65   EXT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       65
     They pull up in front, park.     Go inside.

     CAMERA LINGERS long enough for us to notice a puddle from an
     OIL LEAK exactly where "Zeke" was parked.

     THE MUSIC FADES OUT.


66   INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR - DAY                                       66
     The MANAGER, a fat woman in a muumuu, waddles ahead of them,
     a huge keychain CLINKING with each of her steps.

                         MANAGER
               Apartment 2-B, right?

     Alan looks at Cynthia.

                            CYNTHIA
               Right.

                         MANAGER
               2B or not 2B, that is the question.

     She chuckles at her own wit, arrives at the door.      Opens it.


67   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                                67
     They step inside. The place is completely bare.       No
     furniture. Nothing. Cynthia is stunned.

                            CYNTHIA
               B..but...     it... it's empty!

                         MANAGER
               Of course it is. I     don't show
               rented apartments.     Anyway, what
               you see is what you    get... one
               bedroom, gas range,    yadda yadda
               yadda.

                  Supposed to be six months minimum,

     Cynthia is staggering around the room, looking everywhere.
     She stares long and hard at a DUST-FREE rectangle where the
     painting...

     ...might have been.

                  How long has this place been

                      (pointing)
                  There's a double-door closet in
                  there on the left.

     Alan goes in.

     triumphant.

     CAMERA TILTS UP. There is, indeed, a corresponding damp spot
     directly above the one on the rug. As we WATCH a DRIP plops
     down.

     Wasserman SLAMS his hand down on the desk, furious. Cynthia
     JUMPS, squeezes Alan's hand. Berrisford sits quietly, leans
     forward and picks up the pan holder Wasserman has displaced.

                            WASSERMAN
                  Twelve hours! You wait twelve
                  hours to tell me about this? Am I
                  supposed to be grateful for your
                  civic-mindedness? I told you the
                  Unity House case was still open--
                      (pointing at Cynthia)
                  --and she's the only lead. You
                  should have called me the minute
                  you found out--

                            BERRISFORD
                      (calmly)
                  Found out what? Lieutenant, if I
                  called the police every time one of
                  my patients experienced a fantasy
                  or a delusion, you'd have to move
                  in here--

                       BERRISFORD
             The security guard didn't see
             anyone--

                       CYNTHIA
             Then the security guard needs

                 (on the spot)
             The apartment did match her general

             --a one bedroom flat with a beige

             it... tumbled out of bed positive
             that we've just lived something
             that was only a dream--

          rest? Lemme get a policewoman to
          stand by while a gynecologist
          checks out your plumbing. We'll
          see soon enough if your ghost left
          a calling card--

Cynthia hauls off and gives Wasserman a tremendous SLAP.

                    CYNTHIA
          You bastard.

She goes to the door, looks at the doctors.

                     CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          You...
              (searching)
          --experts!

She goes out, SLAMS the door.    Wasserman rubs his jaw, checks
his mouth.

                    BERRISFORD
          Wonderful! Wonderful! I've been
          waiting and waiting for her to
          finally show real anger--real
          emotion! This could be a
          breakthrough!
              (sincere)
          Thank you, Lieutenant.

Wasserman holds a filling in his fingertips.

      She sits, looking very distracted. As Alan continues
      speaking, he occasionally looks at her, but--to her relief--
      deliberately doesn't single her out.

                   start together and eliminate the
                   wimp factor. Come on.

      He starts POUNDING his pillow with a steady beat. Gradually,
      self-consciously, the others JOIN in except for Cynthia.

      whispers.

                I know you had a rough night.   But

      Miriam gives a very theatrical scream. There's some
      laughter, but others try, too. Gilda begins to give little
      angry yelps. Ralph is really punching some ancient enemy.
      Connie does a respectable if modest SCREAM. Ed SNARLS with
      more anger than we'd expect.

75    INT. UNITY HOUSE COMMON ROOM - NIGHT                                75
      The scene in exactly like the first time we saw this room
      with one difference: the hospital Group Therapy crowd sits in
      the room. They are oblivious to the change around them. Now
      their pounding gradually UNIFIES, becomes a background voodoo-
      like DRUMMING.

      Cynthia is speechless. She looks at then in amazement, but
      none of them notice her. Suddenly she sees

75A   HARRIS                                                             75A
      He's across from her, SMILING.    Again, he sleeks back his
      hair in that amber liquid.

                           HARRIS
                 You failed me, Cynthia...   You
                 failed all of us...

      Harris holds a wooden match. With it he presses back a
      fingernail. It snaps off and bleeds. Harris watches
      Cynthia.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 We were supposed to be together...
                 in this world... and in the next...

      CAMERA WIDENS to take in the cistern of liquid.    We SEE the
      dripping wet Unity members.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 It was going to be perfect, all of
                 us taking the same journey... You
                 shouldn't have run. You made us
                 wait for you while you slept...
                 all those years.

      He presses back another nail SNAP. CAMERA WIDENS FURTHER.
      Now we see something we didn't see before: a dozen or so
      PLASTIC JERRY CANS marked "GASOLINE--DANGER--PLAMMABLE."

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 The waiting time is over, my
                 lovechild. It's time for you to
                 join us. In Unity...

      Another.   SNAP.   Hands and faces everywhere are soaked.   They
      DRIP.

      Her throat muscles constrict, but she can't speak. She looks
      over at Alan, who seems not to see any of this. Now, eyes
      widening in horror, Cynthia LOOKS DOWN and sees a POOL OF
      GASOLINE SPREADING TOWARDS HER. It washes against the
      pillow, her knees.

      He takes the match and strikes it through the pile of nails.

      The nails scatter.

                             HARRIS (CONT'D)
                   ...Come to us, Cynthia. It's time
                   to die. Don't lot another take
                   your place. Come to us... now.

      The match is lit.    He throws it off.

76    SLOW MOTION                                                     76
      It FALLS through the air. Lands on the soaked carpet.   An
      EXPLOSION of flames. They RUSH TOWARDS CYNTHIA--

                             CYNTHIA
                   NOOOOOOOOO--!

      It is a blood-curdling and heart-stopping a scream as ever
      heard.

      There is a FLASH of light.

      Cynthia's SCREAM trails off as she THROWS herself back from
      the pillow.

      The Unity House Members and Harris are all gone.

      The group therapy people all turn to her in amazement.

      Open mouthed, she DROPS the match she's holding to light a

      Cynthia sits in a crumpled sprawl in Alan's office. The room
      is decorated in comforting tones, with Sierra Club posters
      and outdoors-y souvenirs. The late afternoon sun steams in
      through the partially closed blinds.

      Alan sits beside Cynthia on the couch, concerned.   Berrisford
      sucks on his pipe, makes notes.

      Wasserman, rocking on the legs of his chair, jots in his own

                was going to be their break with
                the world... a world that didn't
                understand them. I don't remember
                if they took a vote or if Harris
                just... decided. But they all
                agreed. They were... happy...
                smiling... laughing... crying from
                happiness as he drenched them in
                the gasoline...

             Somehow, I... I knew it was
             wrong... I ran... When he threw
             the match, I was at the other end
             of the hallway... There was a
             flash... and a... like a wind, or
             the hand of God--picked me up,
             threw me... The ceiling fell in...
             When I opened my eyes...
                 (she looks up)
             I was here.

Hettie appears in the doorway, tray in hand, raises her
eyebrows inquisitively at Alan. Alan nods immediately: Hell,
yes. Hettie comes in, gives Cynthia her medication.

Wasserman closes his book, looks thoughtful.

                       ALAN
                 (to Wasserman)
             If that's what happened, why didn't
             you find any evidence of arson?

                       WASSERMAN
             The plastic jerry cans would've
             burned up before anything else...
             We knew there'd been an
             explosion... We just didn't know
             how or why.

Berrisford stands, approaches Wasserman as the police officer
closes his book, moves to the doorway.

                       BERRISFORD
             Well. You must be pleased.
             Closing a case after... what is it,
             twelve years?

                       WASSERMAN
             Who says it's closed?

The medical people look at him.      Cynthia's thoughts are
elsewhere.

                       ALAN
             What's that supposed to mean?

                       WASSERMAN
             When the fairy princess here woke
             up, she said she didn't remember
             anything about 32 deaths. Now she
             remembers they committed suicide...

               but she, of course, was innocent.
               Who knows what she'll remember
               tomorrow? Running for help... or
               pouring gasoline on the fire?

     He goes out.

                         HETTIE
               That man's a candidate for shock
               therapy... with a car battery
               right to the cojones.

                         CYNTHIA
               No... he's right.     I am guilty.

     They look at her, startled.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
               I'm guilty of lying... to Unity
               House. I promised to be part of
               it... Forever. They expected me
               to keep my word.
                   (pause)
               They still do.

     She stands, goes out. Alan and Hettie look worried.
     Berrisford looks... unsurprised. He turns to Alan.

                         BERRISFORD
               Well, Alan. Still think she
               doesn't belong in the group?

     Alan just looks at him.

80   INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY                                             80
     Cynthia, in her bathrobe, wanders out of the shower in
     between the dark, steamy rows of lockers. She passes Lana
     and Miriam. Miriam is dressing, and Lana is putting on a
     swimsuit.

                         MIRIAM
               Nothing like a hot shower, huh?

     Cynthia doesn't hear or see them. She settles on the far end
     of the bench. She sits there blankly. Lana nears, with
     great trepidation.

                          LANA
               Cynthia?   Cynthia?   Are you okay?

Cynthia looks up.

                         CYNTHIA
             What?

                       LANA
             Are you all right?    After that
             session today, I--

                         CYNTHIA
             I'm fine.

Cynthia starts to dress, ignoring Lana.         Lana stands there
for a moment, very awkwardly.

                       LANA
             I think... you're a decent
             person... not a... mean spirited
             witch like some people...

She thrown a look at Miriam, who just smiles pleasantly.

                       LANA (CONT'D)
             --and, well, if you need a friend
             here...

                       CYNTHIA
                 (distant tone)
             All my friends are dead.

Rattled, Lana backs off, on the verge of tears, rushing past
Miriam, who has observed all this.

                       MIRIAM
             Lana, wait a minute, she didn't
             mean it--shit.

Miriam closes her locker and comes over to Cynthia.

                       MIRIAM (CONT'D)
             I know Lana's a mealy-mouthed
             little prude, but she means well.
             I probably pull her chain too
             much... She's reaching out, like
             all of us. Try and help her.

                       CYNTHIA
             I can't even help myself.

Miriam looks at her, puzzled, then exits the locker room,
heading back to the ward.

      Beyond the lockers, through a doorway, we see Lana lowering
      herself into the pool. Blue ripples line the wall beyond.

                          DISTANT VOICES
                    (echo affect)
                Be cleansed!

      The SOUND of the VOICES unnerves Cynthia.     She presses her
      hands against her forehand in pain.

      We are TIGHT ON Cynthia.    We hear SPLASHING.

                          VOICE
                Cleanse the heart of your mind.

      A bright white light melts across Cynthia's face.     She looks
      up. Something draws her forward.

80A   CYNTHIA - SIDE ANGLE                                               80A
      She begins walking, passing behind CLOTHES RACKS and LOCKERS.
      Then, somehow, the SHADOWS of these things become the SHADOWS
      of TREES, and then Cynthia is

80B   ON A BROAD FIELD                                                   80B
      which leads down to a POND. Twenty or so PEOPLE are gathered
      at the edge of the water. We see the Unity House in the
      distance.

      Cynthia moves behind a tree to watch. Harris stands waist-
      deep in the pond. The Unity House Members all sit or stand
      on the shore. Harris holds his hands out in a gesture. A
      girl comes forward through the group out into the water. It
      is Cynthia, the younger Cynthia, with long hair in a braid.

      She smiles at Harris as she nears him. He clutches her
      hands. Behind the tree, Cynthia watches "herself," absorbed.

      Harris looks into Cynthia's eyes.    He touches her face.

                             HARRIS
                Cynthia.     You are part of the
                whole.

      He grabs her by the back of the head and plunges her
      violently under water.

                          HARRIS (CONT'D)
                Cleanse the heart of the mind!

      He yanks her up.   She smiles exultantly.    He dunks her back
      down.

                          HARRIS (CONT'D)
                Cleanse the soul of the self!

      He yanks her up again, but it's not Cynthia. It's LANA.
      Before she can catch her breath, she's plunged back down.

80C   LANA - CLOSER                                                      80C
      She's yanked up, but this time she's not in the pond, she's
      in that gasoline-filled cistern!

                          HARRIS (CONT'D)
                Cleanse the spirit of the body!

      He holds her under. She starts to move her arms around to
      grab hold of something to pull herself up, but Harris is too
      strong. She flails around desperately.

80D   CYNTHIA                                                            80D
      Alarmed, she moves forward--

80E   WITH LANA - UNDER WATER                                            80E
                          HARRIS (CONT'D)
                    (distant)
                Cleanse the spirit.

      Lana's gasping, inhaling water, turning blue.    Harris is
      possessed.

                            HARRIS (CONT'D)
                Cleanse.

      Her movements slow.   Her eyes close.   She is completely
      still.

80F   HARRIS - CLOSE                                                     80F
      He looks directly at Cynthia.

                          HARRIS (CONT'D)
                I warned you, Cynthia. I warned
                you someone else would take your
                place.

80G   UNDER WATER AGAIN                                                  80G
      His HAND withdraws from Lana. Her eyes OPEN. No life there.
      SHE FLOATS UPWARDS. THE CAMERA BREAKS THE SURFACE OF THE
      WATER WITH HER.

      We're in the clinic's swimming pool! On the edge of the
      pool, Cynthia SCREAMS, drops to her knees in horror.

      Someone wades out to Lana's body, drags it to the concrete
      deck, tries futilely to pump life back into it.

      Across the pool, Cynthia flails at the people trying to help
      her.

      vein. We WIDEN, see Berrisford has injected her. Alan
      watches, concerned.

      Cynthia flails on the bed, already reacting to the sedative
      qualities of the drug.

                          CYNTHIA
                --He killed her--he killed her

                friendship... That's why... he
                took her...

      She's out cold. Behind the doctors, in the doorway, the
      other clinic patients press close, curious. Hettie pushes
      them out and down the hallway.

      Alan looks down at Cynthia with genuine concern.    But

                   know what's bad? Burning. When I
                   was in the great Fire of London,
                   well, let me tell you--

      Hearing this, Cynthia chokes back a sob, jumps up and leaves
      the room. Miriam whirls on Connie.

                             MIRIAM
                   Connie, I don't know about your
                   previous lives, but in this one,
                   you're a shithead.

      She follows Cynthia.


88B   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - DAY                                        88B
      Cynthia is on the bad, crying. Miriam comes in, sits beside
      her... Cynthia jumps at the weight on the bad, calms when
      she sees who it is.

                             MIRIAM
                   Honey, you can't blame yourself.
                   Lana was an unhappy girl.
                   Sometimes unhappy girls do foolish
                   things.

                             CYNTHIA
                   She didn't kill herself.

      Cynthia sits up.

                             CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                   It was Harris.

                             MIRIAM
                   Harris?

             From Unity House. He comes to me,
             Miriam. He talks to me. He
             reminds me that I was supposed to
             go with them that night--

                       MIRIAM
             Go with them--

                       CYNTHIA
             Through the fire. To the next
             world. They waited while I was in
             a coma... He told me that if I
             didn't join him, he would take
             someone also... and he did it,
             Miriam, he did it!

Miriam gets up, her face a mixture of sympathy... sympathy
and something else. She lights a cigarette. Involuntarily,
Cynthia FLINCHES at the spark.

                        CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
             You...   you don't believe me, do
             you?

                       MIRIAM
             I believe that you believe it. And
             I also believe that shooting you up
             every time you get the heebie-
             jeebies ain't gonna do shit for
             your real problems. We gotta get
             you out of here--get you to some
             nice place at the beach or the
             mountains where you can fight your
             demons in your own way. Right?

                       CYNTHIA
             But I don't know anyone.   I don't
             have any money.

                       MIRIAM
             You know me.

                       CYNTHIA
                 (skeptical)
             And you have money, right?

                Look. Despite popular opinion to
                the contrary, I have not always
                been the career borderline
                psychotic neurotic that I am today.
                Up until a coupla years ago I was a
                writer, a reporter, a damn good one
                too... Hell, I really kicked some
                ass with that Selectric...

      She seems lost in thought for a moment. Unconsciously, she
      scratches her wrist... a wrist where we notice for the first
      time a PURPLE SCAR across the veins.

                    (turning)
                I was on the staff of a magazine...
                Well, some people called it a rag,
                but it was home: ME! Magazine. You
                heard of it?

                          CYNTHIA
                    (shaking her head,
                     diplomatic)
                I was in a coma.

                          MIRIAM
                Oh, right. Well, when they took me
                off to the funny farm, Saul--he's
                the editor--he said I was always
                welcome back. Maybe this is the
                time. See, if I can go to him,
                tell him your story, I could get a
                big advance... I'd share it with
                you, and we'd be set! I mean,
                girl, your story has everything...
                death, hospitalization, weird
                rituals, maybe a little romance--
                I've seen all those longing glances
                between you and Goldman-

                          CYNTHIA
                What--!

                          MIRIAM
                --and now with poor Lana we got a
                little mystery. Hell, you're not
                an article, you're a goddamned mini-
                series!

                         MIRIAM
               Cynthia, let me be honest. This is
               a great story, and it means a
               second chance for me, so, okay,
               there's some self interest here.
               But I really think you need to tell
               people about Unity House... about
               the way decent ideas and dreams got
               twisted into something sick and
               poisonous. You owe it to the
               world. You owe it to yourself.
               It's your life, and you have to ask
               yourself how you want to live it...
                   (sharper)
               --if you want to live it.

     Cynthia turns, mind made up.

                         CYNTHIA
               Let's do it.

                                               CUT TO,.

     Cynthia walks along with Miriam towards the banks of
     elevators.

                         MIRIAM
               I think I know a way to make a
               phone call. We'll have you out of
               here tonight.

     Miriam suddenly stops, almost paralyzed with anxiety.

                           MIRIAM (CONT'D)
               Cynthia.    This is the right thing
               to do.

                         CYNTHIA
               Of course it is.

                            MIRIAM
               Uh oh.     Mum's the word.

     Alan is coming down the hallway towards them.   They move
     towards the elevator.

             Ladies. Good to see you
             socializing, Cynthia.

                          CYNTHIA
             Yes.
                 (to Miriam)
             See you later. And...     thanks.

                          MIRIAM
             Thank you.

Miriam then gets into the elevator.         The doors remain open,
Alan turns to Cynthia.

                       ALAN
             How are you feeling?

                          CYNTHIA
             Fine.

                          ALAN
             Good.

He heads off in the opposite direction. Cynthia watches him.
She turns back towards Miriam. Miriam is alone in the
elevator except for one other person.

Miriam smiles and waves.

Cynthia smiles and waves.

From behind Miriam, Harris, all burned and puffy, smiles and
waves.

The elevator doors close.

                          CYNTHIA
             No!

Alan whirls around.       Cynthia rushes to the elevator.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
             Miriam!    Stop!

She bangs on the buttons. She pounds on the doors.          Everyone
in the corridor turns to look.

                          ALAN
             Cynthia?

     Cynthia sprints down a flight.    She goes out onto


94   INT. HALLWAY, ONE FLIGHT DOWN                                       94
     Cynthia runs to the elevator and pounds on the button, but
     the elevator car has already passed.

                   (yelling into the door)
               Miriam, get out!

     She races back to

     She flies down the steps.    We can hear ALAN tailing her.

                          ALAN'S VOICE
               Cynthia!

     She swings around a turn into a flight and trips.     Suddenly
     she's ROLLING DOWN A

     distance.

                         ANOTHER VOICE
               She's trying to get away!

     There are PEOPLE pounding through the brush all around her.
     She gets up and runs along the path into the forest.

                        VOICE
               Cynthia! We want you to stay with
               us! You mustn't be afraid!

     She is in total panic, running blindly.

     Branches thrash her face. She can barely see where she is
     going, but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark
     precipice, a cliff which seemingly has no bottom--just black
     as night.

     The people are getting nearer.

                            FEMALE VOICE
                  She's over here.

     We see someone nearing through the brush.

                            HARRIS
                  No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain.
                  Come with us. Share with us. Take
                  my hand.

     Cynthia looks down the cliff.

                            ORDERLY'S VOICE
                  Take my hand.

     Cynthia backs away. She starts lowering herself down, trying
     to get footing. Some rocks slide out.

                  Cynthia, take my hand.

     The Orderly rushes to her, but she wavers dizzily and FALLS
     down the half-flight. She's dazed, but she becomes alert
     when she sees the orderly approaching. She picks herself up
     and runs.


98   INT. TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR                                       98
     She gets to the elevator. The door is just closing, but it
     opens again against a purse--Miriam's purse. The elevator is
     empty. Cynthia whips around looking for her. Orderlies and
     nurses are moving towards her.

     At the opposite and of the hallway, a window is broken.
     Cynthia runs to it. There is a WOMAN'S SCREAM from the
     street below. PEOPLE YELLING. Cynthia looks out and down.

     We know what she sees.    She covers her face.

      An orderly takes hold of her. She is docile now, almost
      weak. Alan runs up. He looks out the window. So does a
      Nurse.

      The nurse crosses herself.    Cynthia is escorted away amid the
      confusion.

      The CAMERA IS MOVING FORWARD, TOWARDS the window.

      It seemingly goes OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW.

      The FRAME is filled with bright blue sky.

      Silence, except for a slight BREEZE.

      Someone is falling through the sky.       It is MIRIAM.

      We see her CLOSER, flowing down, the wind rushing up round
      her. She is happy.

                   Cynthia, it's really quite

      The ground comes rushing up and we SLAM into it.

             You're not listening to me! He
             wants us all to die! He wants you
             all with them, and it's because of
             me!
                 (sobbing)
             It's all because of me...

Berrisford addresses a pack of about thirty REPORTERS and
PHOTOGRAPHERS and CAMERAMEN.

                       FIRST REPORTER
             Dr. Berrisford, what would you call
             two suicides on your promises so
             close together?

                       BERRISFORD
             I'd call it a tragic coincidence.
             Unfortunately, Borderline
             Personality Disorder is indicative
             of a pre-existing disposition
             towards suicidal tendencies.

                       SECOND REPORTER
             What about the commune girl? Has
             she confirmed that the fire was
             some sort of mass suicide?

                       BERRISFORD
             As that is a police matter, I am
             not at liberty to comment on it.

                          FIRST REPORTER
                Speaking of the police, doctor,
                isn't it true that they suspect
                that the recent deaths may not have
                been suicides at all?

                          BERRISFORD
                That's completely absurd.   Where do
                you get this nonsense?

                          FIRST REPORTER
                    (a smug smile)
                From Lieutenant Wasserman. He
                confirmed to me that he's assigning
                some of his officers to the
                hospital grounds until further
                notice.

      Pandemonium as the other reporters seize this information.

                          REPORTERS
                    (rapid fire)
                Doctor Berrisford, are you
                cooperating with the police? Dr.
                Berrisford, do your patients have a
                history of violence?

                          BERRISFORD
                Ah... I have work to do.    No
                further questions.

      And--flustered for once--he leaves the room.

                                                 CUT TO:


107   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                        107
      It is raining.   Cynthia sits in bed, in the dark.

      We see the CHARRED AND BURNED HARRIS sitting across the room
      in a shadow. Cynthia looks over at him.

                          HARRIS
                You're in pain, Cynthia.

      He reaches up to his face, and peels off some skin.    It
      CRACKLES and oozes. He peels off more.

                          HARRIS (CONT'D)
                Your pain is my pain. We share it
                all, because we have our love.

                   Our love will never die. Don't
                   make me take another of your
                   friends. Keep your promise,
                   lovechild. Join me.

      She stands, fumbles for the switch, knocks over a glass, and
      turns on the light.

      He is gone. As she stands there in shock, a HAND touches her
      shoulder, spins her around. She GASPS--

      It's Alan, who's just opened the door.        He looks at her,
      worried.

                             ALAN
                   I didn't want you to be alone.

      She sways, dizzy, sags in his arms.

                             ALAN (CONT'D)
                   Looks like I was right.

108   INT. CONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT                                             108
      Connie is sitting on her bad. She takes her pills from
      Hettie dutifully. Ed comes in.

                             HETTIE
                   What are you doing here?

                             ED
                   You know me at feeding time.

      He takes his meds from her, smiling. CHEWS THEM loudly and
      sloppily until she grimaces and goes out.

      Then, the minute the door closes, Ed and Connie are in each
      other's arms. They kiss like characters in a Harlequin
      Romance.

                             CONNIE
                       (coming up for air)
                   Why didn't you tell me before that
                   you were a Prince of Ancient
                   Atlantis?

                             ED
                   It slipped my mind ...    your
                   Highness.

       CONTINUED:

       She kisses him passionately again.    He breaks the clinch,
       pulls her towards the door.

                              ED (CONT'D)
                    They'll have bed check soon.   I
                    know a better place.


109    INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       109
       Alan site on the counter across from Cynthia's bed.    He plays
       with the hinged mirror on the wall.

                              ALAN
                    I don't know if you want to hear
                    this or not, and frankly, I don't
                    care.

       As he toys with the mirror, we see a CANTED REFLECTION of
       first Cynthia and then the hallway. A nurse passes by.

109A   ON CYNTHIA                                                        109A
       As she listens.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    You are no more responsible for
                    those deaths twelve hours ago than
                    you are for the ones twelve years
                    ago.

       Something catches her eye.

       Connie and Ed walk by.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Thinking otherwise is putting you
                    in a self-replicating spiral of
                    depression. And that puts me in a
                    bind... What do I do, write more
                    prescriptions? You need to face
                    reality, not get medicated out of
                    it...

       Cynthia GASPS.    HARRIS HAS APPEARED IN THE MIRROR, following
       Ed and Connie.

       Cynthia jumps up, heads for the door.    Alan catches her by
       the wrist,

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Damn it, Cynthia, you can't run
                    away from this--

                              CYNTHIA
                    It's Harris--he's going to do
                    something to Connie--to Ed--!

       Alan SLAPS her.    She pales... tries to hit him back.

                              ALAN
                    Good! Get mad--get angry--but not
                    at me--at these fantasies--!

       She stands on rocky feet, unsure...


112    INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                               112
       Connie and Ed come to a door marked "Utility." Ed looks
       around cautiously and opens the door, relieved that it's
       still unlocked.


113    INT. UTILITY ROOM - NIGHT                                          113
       Once inside the small space, he kisses Connie. He pulls out
       a pint flask of schnapps from his bathrobe pocket. He gives
       her a swig.

                              CONNIE
                        (wistful)

                              ED
                    No fooling you.

       He leads her back to a door that's labeled "DANGER:
       Authorized Personnel Only." The lock is busted open.     They go
       in.
                                                               75.




114   INT. TURBINE ROOM - NIGHT                                        114
      There are metal grating steps leading up to a platform that
      sits adjacent to a huge spinning turbine, its six-foot blades
      WHIRRING at top speed. Air ducts lead in and out of the
      space.

      Connie is uplifted, frightened, exhilarated. Their clothes
      and hair are blown around. They ascend the platform, and sit
      across from each other. They each take a swig. They kiss
      softly, spiritually.

                          ED
                I'm so happy.


115   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                             115
      The door to the utility room CLOSES.   It LOCKS.


116   INT. TURBINE ROOM - NIGHT                                        116
      Connie and Ed stare into each other's eyes.   They are lost.

      The CAMERA MOVES IN AND OUT between and around them,
      exploring the depth of their absorption. The CAMERA MOVES
      TOWARDS the huge spinning turbine. Its SOUND builds to a
      tremendous ROAR.

      We see Connie and Ed through the door into the turbine room.
      The door is pulled closed by someone or something. The knob
      locks.


117   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      117
      Cynthia keeps looking at the door, worried.

                          ALAN
                Miriam and Lana were both deeply
                disturbed women. Miriam tried to
                kill herself before. Lana was
                obsessed with the morbid... You
                heard her in the sessions. You
                can't twist what they did into
                something other than what it was.

      Just then, all the lights go OUT.

      Nothing. The door OPENS. In the dim light of the hallway
      emergency lamps, we SEE Cynthia go out.

                             ALAN (CONT'D)
                   Damn it, Cynthia, come back--!

      Trying to follow, he COLLIDES With some furniture.

      Darkness and confusion. Cynthia passes by the CAMERA. A
      moment later Alan comes by, looking for her. Other patients
      come out and wonder. Flashlights. A NURSE streams by.

                             NURSE
                   It's just overloaded circuits.
                   Everyone, please go back into your

      CAMERA ADJUSTS to show an elderly, skeletal custodian, EDGAR,
      on the phone.

                   We'll set it straight in a minute.
                   Somethin's caught in the turbine.

      Edgar comes up to the utility door, but it won't budge.

                   Goddammit.

121    INT. UTILITY TUNNEL - NIGHT                                           121
       This is a low passageway between floors. Edgar has to stoop
       under the ducts and pipes. He comes to a small hatchway in
       the coiling above him marked "CAUTION: Turbine."

       There is a latch which has to be pulled to release the
       hatchway. Edgar pulls. It's stuck. He yanks with his frail
       body. The latch barely moves.

       A TRICKLE OF BLOOD streams out at the edge, but Edgar doesn't
       see it.

       Edgar yanks and pulls with all his might, groaning and
       heaving. Finally he stops in frustration. He sits an a
       duct, resting.

       Just then the latch undoes itself. The hatchway slams open.
       Edgar is showered with red lumpy fluid. He is coated with
       it.

                            EDGAR
                  What the hell?

       Edgar looks down. In the pool of red is a woman's shoe.
       Puzzled, he bends down, picks it up. Something FALLS OUT OF
       IT.

121A   ON THE FLOOR                                                        121A

       as he reacts in shock, the spinning turbine begins to
       SPLATTER DROPS OF BLOOD on him.

                    Cynthia.

       Cynthia moves down the hall a bit.       She looks up at the
       coiling.

123    ANGLE - THE AIR VENT                                                 123
                              CONNIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Cynthia, we're up here!

       Down the hall further, another vent.

                              ED'S VOICE
                    Come with us, Cynthia!

                              CONNIE'S VOICE
                    You must join us, Cynthia!

       Cynthia follows the voices. She is underneath another larger
       vent with a fan spinning inside. Everyone in the hall
       ignores her.

                              HARRIS' VOICE
                    Cynthia, you must reach out and
                    embrace our love for you... You
                    must reach out to me...

       We see Harris now, behind the fan, in brief flashes of light,
       burnt then normal, gazing down at Cynthia. He reaches
       towards her.

                              CYNTHIA
                    Where are Connie and Ed?

       His fingers ARE SLICED OFF BY THE FAN.       He takes no notice.

                              HARRIS
                    They're with us now.

       We hear SPLASHING. Cynthia looks over. Gallons of blood and
       solid matter pour out of the ceiling vents all down the hall.

                           CYNTHIA
                 Where are they?
                     (she is frantic)
                 Where are Connie and Ed?   Where are
                 they?

       Alan wonders at the pouring red, then he hears Cynthia
       screaming. He runs down the hall to stop her.

       The patients and nurses watch the blood pour in horror.
       Cynthia is getting more and more hysterical.

                           CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                 Where are Connie and Ed?

       Alan corners her.

                           ALAN
                 It's all right--it's all right--

       Suddenly, out of nowhere, a BL00D-COVERED BODY careens into
       them, driving them apart!

       It's Edgar, covered with blood, in a total state of shock.

                           EDGAR
                 --horrible--sweet Jesus--help me--

       Alan struggles to restrain him.   Nurses run to help.

       Huddles on the floor in a position not unlike the one from
       her coma. She SOBS uncontrollably.

       out, watches Edgar pass by in a wheelchair, raving. Ralph
       and Gilda come up to Alan.

      Alan looks at her.       How did the grapevine got it to her so
      fast?

                             ALAN
                   Yes. We're not sure what
                   happened... There was evidence
                   that they were drinking... They
                   fell into... the main turbine.

                             RALPH
                   Fuck... Look, Ed drank before.
                   Lots of times. Didn't know that,
                   did you? But he didn't usually
                   decide to jump into a mix master,
                   man!

                             ALAN
                   Ralph, as for your own safety, you
                   are being given the most amount of
                   protection possible.

                             GILDA
                   The police are powerless.    Ask
                   Cynthia. She knows.
                       (softly)
                   Harris wants us all.

      Ralph looks at Gilda with almost as much dismay as Alan.

                             RALPH
                   Jesus Fucking Christ!    I'm getting
                   the hell out of here.

      Ralph storms out.

      As Ralph moves along, a paunchy POLICEMAN intercepts him.

      The newscast continues silently on the TV in her room.    She
      is getting dressed. She peaks out the door.


128   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                               128
      The Policeman assigned to her is down the hall a ways,
      chatting with a nurse. Cynthia slips out and down the
      corridor.

      She waits for an elevator. When a door opens, she tries to
      inconspicuously slip inside but she finds herself face to
      face with Alan who in just getting out of the elevator. He
      holds a grocery bag.

                             ALAN
                   Isn't this a coincidence?

                             CYNTHIA
                   I'm getting out of here.

      He takes her arm and starts leading her back to her room.

                             ALAN
                   Believe it or not, this is the
                   safest place for you to be. The
                   police are here. There are doctors
                   here. And I'm going to keep you
                   company, all night. I even brought
                   provisions.

      He shows a variety of fast food.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                   Pure unadulterated junk. At this
                   point, who cares about the
                   chemicals?

      She smiles slightly. He holds his arm out for her like a
      swain escorting his date. She takes it in a similar spirit.

       The policeman comes out of Cynthia's room, looking for her in
       alarm. He's instantly relieved to see her there with Alan.
       Alan directs her inside. She goes. Alan gives the Policeman
       a look.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Try harder next time.

       He goes into her room, leaving the embarrassed cop behind.
       Suddenly the LIGHTS RETURN with an eye-jarring FLASH. The
       cop has his revolver halfway out of the holster before he
       realizes what it is.

       They both react   to the returned power with relief. Alan
       takes the stuff   out of the bag: chips, dips, cookies, six-
       packs of beer.    He offers some of the chips. She shakes her
       head. The TV's    still on. Alan switches channels with the
       sound muted.

                    Yes, they are. Everyone's under
                    protection. Nothing can happen.

       pointing upwards. An outstretched hand SLAMS itself down,
       the blade impaling through the palm. The hand squirms its
       fingers a bit, then pulls off.

       He gets up clenching the perforated hand. He is very calm.
       He closes the knife and puts it in a drawer.

       Suddenly, violently, he kicks a trash bin.      Then he is calm
       again.

       Ralph's assigned Policeman pokes his head in the door.

      Alan lies back in front of the TV, eyes closed, SNORING.
      Sympathetic, Cynthia slips the remote control from his
      hand... then there is a KNOCK at the door. She goes there,
      finds Ralph, who steps inside.

                   Ralph was just here.   His hand
                   was... all bloody.

      They go to the door and they are immediately faced with
      Hettie.

                   Shit! It's his tranquilizer! If he

      Every five or six feet along in a line, there is a moderately-
      sized droplet splatter of blood. They follow the droplets
      along the hallway.

      They follow the droplets through a set of double doors.

      them.

      These hallways are unused.       Nobody around.

                          ALAN
                Was he behaving strangely?

                          CYNTHIA
                No more strangely than everybody
                also in this place.

                           CYNTHIA'S POLICEMAN
                     (with walkie-talkie)
                I can't get him. He must be shut
                off.

      They pass an open freight elevator.       Cynthia looks in it and
      stops.

      There is a droplet of blood on the floor inside.

                               CYNTHIA
                   Hey.

      A BLOODY HAND reaches out of the elevator covering her mouth
      and pulls her inside.


139   INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                         139
      Ralph holds her, slams the gate closed, and flips the switch.
      The car moves down. Cynthia SCREAMS.

      Alan and the policeman rush up just as the car disappears.

                               ALAN
                   Cynthia!

      They descend.       She wipes blood from her face.   He looks
      wired.

                             CYNTHIA
                   Ralph, we have to go and get your
                   medication.

      She slowly moves to the control panel. He watches her. Just
      as she is about to reach the buttons, he violently pushes her
      back.

                               RALPH
                   Relax.

      He smiles.

      The elevator comes down to a stop. Ralph throws the door
      open. It is a huge dark space, a vast store room. Cynthia
      won't come out. Ralph gestures politely.

             Ralph, I'm not going out.    We have
             to go back upstairs.

Ralph grabs her firmly and pulls her out.

                       CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
             Ralph, please!

                       RALPH
             I have to talk to you.

He leans in the elevator, opens the control panel and yanks
some wires. Sparks fly. The HUM of the elevator motor dies.
Cynthia is panicked.

                       RALPH (CONT'D)
             It's very, very, very, very, very
             important that I talk to you.

                       CYNTHIA
             Ralph, you're not being yourself.
             Can't you tell?

                        RALPH
             No!   This is the real me!

He flies across the basement and, grabbing a chair, smashes
the control box for the electric cargo door, the only other
entrance.

He darts up a storage aisle.      He rips a phone off the wall.

                        RALPH (CONT'D)
             I come down here a lot. It helps
             me unwind.

Cynthia can't see him. He wildly paces up and down the
storage aisles. Cynthia starts to cry.

                       CYNTHIA
             Ralph, please! How do we get out?

                       RALPH
             It's been said by better men than
             me in better ways in better times--
             there is no way out!

She goes to a barred window.

                        CYNTHIA
             Help!

Ralph goes into a rage. He pushes over a huge storage shelf.
Everything spills and breaks. Amid the rubble a pile of
surgical blades lies glinting in a pool of light.

Ralph looks down at it.

Cynthia sees him looking at it. She is afraid. He grabs
some of the blades randomly and disappears. He is walking
crazily up and down the storage aisles. Cynthia only catches
glimpses of him. He jumps up and breaks the individual LIGHT
BULBS which hang on wires, providing the only illumination.
The space grows DARKER. All the while, Ralph talks and
talks.

                    RALPH
          There are only a few chances for
          real glory, and most people fuck it
          up. Most people can't even find
          the noses on their fucking faces.
              (jump, BREAK)
          You want an example? How about
          EVERY FUCKING DOCTOR in this entire
          hospital? Do you think I'm just
          going to let myself slowly dissolve
          into nothingness here?!
              (jump, BREAK)
          I'm talking about a glorious glory.
          And everybody's trying to drag me
          down!

                    CYNTHIA
          Ralph, please, they said you have
          to take some pills.

                    RALPH
          Pills have got nothing to do with
          it! You know what I'm talking
          about!

He jumps, smashes the last bulb.   She can't see him.

                    CYNTHIA
          No, I don't. I don't.

                    RALPH
          You do! Real glory, hallelujah!
          The great big gig in the sky.
          Don't play dumb, Cynthia.

She sees him at the far and of the aisle. His shirt is off.
There are deep, bleeding cuts all over his chest and stomach.
He has blades clenched in both fists.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

Cynthia is terrified.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          I think you know the word I'm
          searching for.

He starts making deep slashes on his arm.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          U, N, I, T, Y! Unity!

                    CYNTHIA
          Oh God, Ralph! No!

                    RALPH
          Yes, oh, yes! Eternal bliss!

He stops and raises the scalpels to his chest.   He jabs them
in and cuts open down to his stomach.

                    CYNTHIA
          Ralph, please, stop!

He swats at the one remaining lamp. It flickers on and off.
Ralph's eyes flutter. He FALLS. Cynthia rushes to him.

                     CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          Ralph!

He throws a scalpel at her.   It misses, but she is spattered
with blood.

                    RALPH
              (fading)
          Get back.

Cynthia is crouched down, crying as she watches him.

                    RALPH (CONT'D)
          Join us, Cynthia.

The light flickers off, then on.   A hand is on Cynthia's
shoulder. She looks up...

it is Harris.

The bulb DIES.   Blackness.

      Lots of COPS, a few DOCTORS and ORDERLIES.    Alan is stopped
      by a FEMALE COP.

      He looks into the basement area and sees Ralph in a pool of
      blood. A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is taking pictures of him.
      Alan stares at Ralph.

      Berrisford is with Cynthia and a nurse.    Cynthia is getting
      an injection.

      Wasserman comes over to Alan and Berrisford.

             Isolation.

             Isolation? Are you out of your

             situation, severe identity crisis
             compounded with the multiple shock
             of these deaths. She's reverting

             the commune through an intermittent

                   Why don't you kill me?

       We see the whole room now. It's filled with Unity House
       Members, all of them. They're sitting leaning, slumping
       everywhere in the shadows. Among them are Connie and Ed.

                             CONNIE
                   You have to do it yourself, honey.
                   When you didn't... he took us
                   instead. But we're not mad. It's
                   wonderful here.

                   Death is like this really beautiful
                   trip Cynthia. We just want to
                   share
                   it with you.

       Lana and Miriam.

                             LANA
                   You mustn't be afraid, Cynthia.

       Harris in playing with his burning finger.

                             MIRIAM
                   if I can do it, you can do it,
                   honey.

      A NURSE notices Cynthia's movement on the screen.       She turns
      the volume up.

                             CYNTHIA (ON TV)
                   Why don't you just kill me?!

      The nurse gets up. Gilda is standing there.        She follows.
      Gilda's policeman lurks nearby.

                             GILDA'S POLICEMAN
                   Hey.


158   INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                           158
                             HARRIS
                   You have to join us because you
                   love us. You have to do it for
                   yourself.

      We hear the Nurse UNLOCKING the door.

      A MALE UNITY MEMBER looks over at the door.       We seem him
      momentarily burned.

                             HARRIS (CONT'D)
                   You have to do it for yourself--
                       (smiling)
                   --lovechild.

      We see Harris momentarily burned.       He blows his finger out.

                             CYNTHIA
                   But I'm so scared.

      The Nurse opens the door.    The room is empty except for
      Cynthia on her bed.

                             NURSE
                   You want me to call the doctor,
                   honey?

      Cynthia says nothing.

                             NURSE (CONT'D)
                   Try to sleep, all right?

      Gilda rushes in behind the Nurse, going to Cynthia.

                             NURSE (CONT'D)
                   Hey, get out of here!

                       (frantic)
                   I can do nothing for you now, but
                   know this--the answer you seek is
                   inside of you! It is inside you!

      Gilda's Policeman comes in.

                             NURSE
                   Get her out of here!

      He pulls at Gilda.

                             GILDA
                       (as she goes)
                   Know yourself and you will be at
                   peace! It is so!

      The Nurse SLAMS the door closed.    Cynthia is alone.


159   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                                159
      Gilda's policeman is on the phone.

                             POLICEMAN
                   Yeah, I'm taking her back to her
                   room... Okay, bye.

      He hangs up, looks around.    Gilda is gone.


160   INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT                                    160

      Gilda's policeman is still looking for her.      She's nowhere in
      sight.


164   INT. GILDA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                           164

      CONTINUED:

      Momentary silence.

      A shaft of light hits Gilda as someone comes in the door.
      Whoever it is nears Gilda. She is calm. She looks over.

                             GILDA
                   I know you'd come.

      Silence.

                             GILDA (CONT'D)
                   But you're too late.

      She holds up a bottle of tablets.       We fleetingly see the word
      "poisonous."

      The bottle SMASHES to the floor.

                                                    CUT TO:

      She looks like she's been crying.       She stares off into space.

      Someone crosses in the shadows to the window.

      The rubber edging is slit with a scalpel.

                             CYNTHIA
                   It feels good. I know this is
                   right.

                             HARRIS' VOICE
                   That's right. You need our love.
                   We need your love.

      A shadowed hand pushes on the plexiglass.       The windowpane
      plops onto the pavement below.

      A breeze wafts in.

      Cynthia gets out of bed and comes to the window. She looks
      out onto the evening horizon, refreshed, fully experiencing
      the moment.

       Alan comes out, still fuming. He walks along a ways and then
       looks at the illuminated SIGN pointing out the way to the
       "Berrisford Clinic." Alan stares at it, then in a sudden
       release of fury, KICKS it, once, twice, and then he THROWS
       his carton at it.

       Calming, feeling like an idiot, he sighs.

                              ALAN
                    Brilliant. Do we feel better now?
                    No. Yes. Maybe.

       A thought strikes him.    He reaches into his shirt pocket,
       takes out--

                        (with a shrug)
                    It's okay, officer. I'll write
                    myself a prescription in the
                    morning.

       He swallows it, dry, with a loud GULP, Then he picks up his
       papers and things, heads for the parking lot.

       PULLBACK as Alan unlocks it, his carton momentarily balanced
       on the car roof. The door open, Alan gets in, puts his box
       in the cluttered back seat. He SHIVERS from one of those
       unexpected chills we all get, then puts the key in the
       ignition, STARTS the engine, turns on the LIGHTS. Then he
       looks up ahead and sees--

       Alan sits, face unreadable.   He REVS the engine.   Faster.

       Berrisford dodges in and out of cars, behind lamp posts.
       Manic, Alan follows him relentlessly, skidding around turns,
       SIDESWIPING as many cars as budget allows. Finally--

171K   BERRISFORD                                                       171K

       He SLAMS Berrisford against the wall. Berrisford's body
       SMACKS against the bricks, rebounds onto the windshield,
       CRACKING IT.

       Alan recoils from the impact, blood on his lips from his own
       collision with the steering wheel. He looks at Berrisford,
       squirming a foot away with the little life left in him.

       Alan CACKLES, gives Berrisford the finger.

       Then he throws the car into reverse.

       The blood hits the windshield.    Idly, distracted, Alan turns
       on the windshield wipers...

       Suddenly HARRIS sits up in the rear seat, a smile on the
       burned and scarred face.

                               HARRIS
                    Good work, Dr. Goldman.   Now, it's
                    your turn.

       Skeletal hands GRAB Alan's throat.       He STRUGGLES.   KICKS--out
       of the corner of his eye he sees-

       Gasoline is flowing over the dented hood and through the

       He jerks his head up, face drenched in sweat. He's still in
       his original parking space! He's never even started the car!
       Gasping for air, still freaked, he opens the door, tumbles
       out.

       The box of his possessions is still on the roof of the car.
       Alan sees this, staggers against the car, fights a wave of
       nausea. Struggling to remain composed, he takes his pulse.
       Feels his head. Suspicion crosses his face. Then his hand
       moves to his shirt pocket.

       He turns, runs like hell towards the clinic.

      The two security guards start     running over. One of them has
      his gun drawn. Alan wants to      run, but he sees there is no
      way out. He sticks his hands      in the air. The guards are
      upon him. They start leading      him away.

      He looks back at Hettie.    He sees a fire alarm.

      Suddenly, he grabs one of the Guard's guns.       He dives against
      the wall and pulls the fire alarm.

      All of the Isolation Ward doors open.     BELLS and SIRENS go

      He hides in a doorway. They pass. He heads back up to

      latch to secure the door. SIRENS and BELLS continue. Alan
      looks over. The room is dark, except for the red light
      flashing on and off. Cynthia is crouched in the far corner
      by the open window.

      We can see that the room is otherwise empty of anybody.

                    still think you're part of the
                    Unity House, and the only way he
                    can prove it is if you want to kill

       Behind Alan, the dark shape of Berrisford emerges from
       outside the window. It is climbing inside from the ledge.

       Cynthia is getting hysterical.      Berrisford stands behind Alan

       Berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some
       skin. Alan flies against the wall.

       The gun is knocked away.

       Alan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness,

       Cynthia is a basket case.     She looks at Alan.

      worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. Alan runs out of
      Cynthia's room. He is surrounded by bizarre-looking people
      screaming, singing, dancing, praying.

      Alan scans every room. He slams into patients. The guards
      aren't far behind. Alan turns a corner, passing a door
      marked "NOT AN EXIT: ROOF ACCESS." It is ajar. He goes in

      flights. The landings face onto the outside with a railing,
      open, no glass.

      She in perched on the outside of the railing, a serene

      hands. He does too. They clasp.

                              ALAN'S VOICE
                   Cynthia!

      Suddenly she FALLS.

      She drops and dangles in the night air against


199   EXT. HOSPITAL BUILDING - NIGHT                                     199
      She is unconscious.     She swings twelve stories above the
      pavement.

      The CAMERA FOLLOWS UP her arm to her hand grasped tightly by
      Alan's hand. We CONTINUE UP TO Alan.

                              ALAN
                   Cynthia! Open your eyes!   Open
                   your eyes!

He is over the railing holding on with his other hand.

Cynthia is coming to.

                       ALAN (CONT'D)
             Pull up! Pull yourself up so I can
             got a grip on you!

                          ALAN
             No!

                          CYNTHIA
             Let me go.     I saw it.   It's
             beautiful.

                       ALAN
             You didn't see shit!       Hold on!

                       BERRISFORD
             Eternal bliss.

                        CYNTHIA
             Yes!   I want to go!    Let me go!

                       BERRISFORD
                 (coming forward)
             Let her go. She needs it.

                       ALAN
             No! Cynthia, Harris doesn't exist!
             He's dead! Look at who that is!
             Look at him! Look!

Cynthia looks at Berrisford deliriously.

He CHANGES from Berrisford to Harris with each FLASH.    He
comes to the railing where Alan is holding on.

Almost politely, he tries to undo Alan's grip.

                       ALAN (CONT'D)
             Goddamn you! Goddamn you!

Alan's grip on Cynthia slips down to her fingers.

                       BERRISFORD
             Let her go. Let her go and I'll
             forget your disobedience.

          together--

                    ALAN
          Publish this, asshole!

Alan SWINGS one leg up, KICKS Berrisford in the groin.
Berrisford HOWLS and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks.
Snarling like an animal, he stomps, claws and even bites at
Alan's hand.

                    ALAN (CONT'D)
              (to Cynthia)
          Don't you hear him? He's trying to
          bribe me--but I'm not letting go!
          I'll go with you, but I'm not
          letting go!

Berrisford sees the discarded gun... picks it up. He aims
unsteadily... SHOOTS. Alan yanks himself out of the way.
Berrisford misses. Berrisford moves closer. Raises the g=
barrel at point black range towards Alan's hand.

                    ALAN (CONT'D)
          Cynthia, help us! Help us both!

                    BERRISFORD
          You'll be with them, Dr. Goldman,
          Be happy.

          No!

                    CYNTHIA
          S...stop it... Stop it!

Berrisford SHOOTS. One of Alan's finger joints is BLOWN
AWAY. He SCREAMS, his grip loosens, and he SLIDES down the
railing. Berrisford moves several yards to stay close...
begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand.

                    ALAN
          Cynthia, don't let him kill you!
          Don't let him do this!

          Unity... It... it's my destiny...
          I've fought it too long. Right or

          It will close the book. End the

          bring joy and happiness! You're
          part of my life now. That's an
          unfinished story, too...

She looks at Berrisford viciously pounding on Alan's hand.

                       CYNTHIA
          Let me up.     Stop it.

She starts to climb up, but she can't.

                       CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          Let me up!

                    BERRISFORD
          I'm afraid it's too late for that.

Alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK.
She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze.

Alan is weakening.   He is losing consciousness.   He knows he
is about to die.

                    GUARD
          Dr. Berrisford?

Suddenly Berrisford freezes.

He is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up
the stairs. Berrisford backs away glaring.

Alan GROANS.   The guard rushes over.

                    GUARD (CONT'D)
          Jesus
              (Yelling down the stairs)
          Gomez, get up here!

The other guard appears.

They start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help
him up, Berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the
wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his
head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger.

CLICK.

CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. Out of bullets. The others are too
busy to be noticing what he in doing. Just as they pull
Cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see:

      Berrisford coming to the railing, and jumping, calmly.
      Silently.

                Holy shit.

      Cynthia numbly watches him fall.    Then she in pulled up and
      over...

200   INT. HALLWAY - OVERHEAD - NIGHT                                 200
      Cynthia is plopped over onto a gurney. Lights are passing
      her. She is being whisked down a hallway. She is descending
      into a haze of unconsciousness.

                          DOCTOR'S VOICE
                I need a detox prep! Stat!

201   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                            201
      Alan runs alongside the gurney with doctors and nurses. He
      clutches bloody bandages to his hand, tries to hear Cynthia.

                          ALAN
                It's okay. It's over. It was
                Berrisford. He killed them.

                          CYNTHIA
                Then all those other things...
                Faces... voices? They were...      in
                my head?

                          ALAN
                It was Berrisford. He shot you up
                with hallucinogens. What he didn't
                do, you imagined.

      There is joy through her delirium. She is just able to clasp
      hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of
      double doors.


202   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                         202
      A new station wagon whisks along the pretty road.
                                                                  114.

      Alan drives, Cynthia looks at a map.       They both look relaxed.
      They both have bandaged hands.

                          CYNTHIA
                Go right if that's the interstate.
                Yeah, it is.


207   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                               207
      Through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of
      Unity House. A chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies
      it. Alan and Cynthia pull up, park. Cynthia gets out and
      looks around. She goes to the front entrance. Alan follows
      her in.


208   INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY                                                208
      A mere skeleton of what it was. Daylight pours in through
      the faded, burnt slats of wood. Patches of woods have
      sprouted up. Cynthia wanders in and marvels at it all. Only
      piles of charcoal signify where furniture was.

      Alan meanders in from the other and of the house.

                          ALAN
                Victorian. Looks like it was a
                nice house once.

                           CYNTHIA
                Yes. I guess appearances can be
                deceiving.

      She moves out upstairs.       He follows her up onto the risky-
      looking steps.

209   ON THE LANDING                                                       209
      She reaches a point at the top that looks out over the meadow
      and pond. She looks out. Alan joins her. Cynthia takes in
      the view contentedly.

                             CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                It's dead.     It's really dead...

       She gestures to the house around them.

                                 CYNTHIA
                    It's over.

       Alan smiles. He pulls her close to him. They look into each
       other's eyes. Neither of them is completely at ease with the
       other, but there is honest affection. They hug, then kiss.

             Cynthia is a unique girl--the
             product of an environment and a
             philosophy unrivaled in its purity.
             I wanted to understand the depth of
             her commitment, the link between
             psychosis and total immersion
             philosophies, the dark terra

             Hey, go chow on a Latin dictionary,
             okay? You can bullshit all you
             want, but how do you account for
             six bodies?

                       BERRISFORD
             Clearly some unknown variable was a
             factor.

                       WASSERMAN
             Yeah? Well, if you didn't kill off

He smiles, shrugs the best he can in his plaster cast.

      Cynthia and Alan are still in each other's arms.        Cynthia
      pulls away.

                            ALAN
                  What's the matter?

                            CYNTHIA
                  I was just thinking about Gilda.
                  Somehow, she knew. She kept
                  talking about "him," but I didn't
                  know what she meant. She said the
                  answer was inside me. Why would
                  she say that?

      Alan doesn't have an answer.     She sighs.

                              ALAN
                  Let's go.

                  You go down. I'll be out in a
                  minute. I just want to... bury
                  some memories.

                              ALAN
                  You sure?

      She nods.   He goes.

      Cynthia gives a final look around at the deteriorated
      structure and turns down the stairs.

      She stands at the top of what remains of the stairs.

      We FOLLOW HER DOWN. Just as she nears the bottom, the
      TICKING of a clock is audible. It gets LOUDER. Cynthia
      reaches the last stop and turns into
                                                               118.




215   INT. FOYER - NIGHT                                                215
      We FOLLOW HER with a CONTINUOUS PAN. The foyer is new now,
      completely untouched by fire, just as it was at the beginning
      of the film. A candelabrum is lit.

      Cynthia turns and we PAN BACK TO THE STAIRCASE. It is new,
      unburnt. Two KIDS come scrambling down the stairs laughing.

      The entranceway, the archway to the front room, the staircase
      are all intact, just as we saw them in the opening scene.

      CYNTHIA peers into the kitchen. Two WOMEN in work aprons are
      kneading bread dough, chopping vegetables. They smile at
      Cynthia.

                           WOMAN 1
                Cynthia!   Are you staying for
                supper?

      Cynthia is silent, wide-eyed, taking it all in.    She turns
      towards the front door. Victor is coming in.

                           VICTOR
                Cynthia.   It's good.   Come in.

      She in unable to resist.


216   INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT                                           216
      They walk in. The room is filled with people. There is a
      fire in the hearth. Children play. Candles illuminate the
      space. Unity Members smile and great her casually as she
      passes them.

      Miriam in talking with a BEARDED MAN intently.

                          MIRIAM
                Cynthia, I'm so glad you're here.

      Ed and Connie are by the fireplace with some others.    They
      smile at Cynthia knowingly.

      Lana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with
      some children.

      Ralph is crouched with victor in a corner.    They are laughing
      warmly.




                                                          (CONTINUED)
                                                       119.
CONTINUED:

Gilda comes up to her. She is ebullient, happier, healthier
looking than we've ever seen her.

                       GILDA
             Cynthia, it's so wonderful here,
             but we miss you terribly.

Cynthia nears Harris. He smiles at her and kisses her.
Everyone in the room turns to her. Harris holds up a shiny
and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle. Cynthia
doesn't see it yet.

He puts the pointed tip against her chest.

                       HARRIS
             It's time, Cynthia.    It's finally
             time, isn't it?

                         EVERYONE
             Yes.

                       CYNTHIA
                 (fighting the vision)
             You don't exist.

                       HARRIS
             I wouldn't say that.
                 (he touches her)
             Go on. Take the knife.

She can't escape his gaze.

                        HARRIS (CONT'D)
             Do it.   You know you want to.

                       GILDA
             You know you do, Cynthia.

                       VICTOR
             You'll see how beautiful it is.

                         SOMEONE ELSE
             You will.

Cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris
lets go. She holds it there by herself, completely
hypnotized by his words, by his eyes.

                       MIRIAM
             Cynthia, we're only telling you
             this because we love you.



                                                   (CONTINUED)
                                                           120.
CONTINUED: (2)

                    HARRIS
          Beautiful lovechild. All will be
          in balance when you've joined us.
          All will be right when daughter is
          with father.

                    SOMEONE
          You're special, Cynthia.

                    SOMEONE ELSE
          Scared blood... daughter of the
          father.

Cynthia in mortified.

                      CYNTHIA
          I'm...?

                    HARRIS
          Now you remember.

                      CYNTHIA
          Yes...

                    HARRIS
          My own beautiful lovechild.
          Everyone has proven their love to
          me. Now you must.

She is weak now.    She is about to do it.

Her grasp tightens around the knife handle.      She's trembling.
She takes a deep breath.

                      CYNTHIA
          No!

She jams the knife into Harris' throat and pulls it out.

                    CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          No I don't! I don't love you!      I
          don't need you!

She is crazed. She flies around the room brandishing the
knife at everyone. They back off.

                     CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          I never loved any of you! I hate
          you! I hate you all! What you did
          was wrong!




                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                               121.
      CONTINUED: (3)

      She swats the knife at them all. Victor's arm gets cut.
      Gilda has to dive away from her. Cynthia is knocking over
      lamps and chairs in her rage. She is crying hysterically.

                          CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                It was WRONG! It was stupid!

                          HARRIS
                    (saddened)
                Oh, Cynthia.

                          CYNTHIA
                I never needed you!    Any of you!

      We are TIGHT ON CYNTHIA. She is winding down, crying with
      her face buried in her arms.

                          CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
                I never did...

      She is still.    Gradually, the silence fills with a quiet
      BREEZE.

                            ALAN
                Cynthia?

      She drops the knife. The knife is all rusty and corroded.
      The floor is a charred mass.

      Cynthia turns around.

      Alan comes in the front door. The room is again its empty,
      skeletal self, blackened and silent.

      Cynthia is trembling.

      She walks out of the room.

                          ALAN (CONT'D)
                Are you all right?

                            CYNTHIA
                Let's go.


217   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                            217
      She stands on the porch, holding onto a post, trying to calm
      herself. Alan comes out. As he starts the car, a gust comes
      up. The trees are thrashed around.

      The WIND ECHOES through the house.


                                                          (CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:

      MUSIC UP SOFTLY, EERILY.

      Cynthia descends the stairs.    The station wagon pulls up.
      She gets inside.


218   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                           218
      They pull out. Slowly we see Cynthia collect herself.      A
      sense of hope is evident.

                             CYNTHIA
                   It's going to be okay.   I'm going
                   to be okay.


219   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                    219
      The car speeds off trailing dust.

      We see the UNITY HOUSE in the distance.     The winds kicks up
      again.


220   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                             220
      We are CLOSER. Branches and leaves are being tossed around
      by violent gusts as we MOVE TOWARD the structure.

      A teenage GIRL comes running up from the field behind.     She
      is crying. She runs into the house. We FOLLOW HER.


221   INT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY                                             221
      She goes to a far corner and cries some more, angrily,
      hopelessly.

                             BOY
                       (far off)
                   Come on, where are you? I hope
                   you're not in that house... You
                   always got like this and make
                   stupid threats that you don't mean!

      The girl peeks out the corner of the window.

222   ANGLE -                                                            222
      The TEENAGE BOY is in the field beyond.

CONTINUED:

                       BOY (CONT'D)
             If you're not here on three, I'm
             history. Permanently. One...
             Two... Three! Fine. Good
             riddance.

THE GIRL backs away from the window, only more upset now.

A hand touches her shoulder.      She whirls around.

                       GIRL
                 (startled)
             Who are you?

                         HARRIS
             A friend.    You're upset.

She nods.

                       HARRIS (CONT'D)
             What would you say if I could
             promise you eternal bliss?

                       GIRL
             Eternal bliss? What do you mean?

TRACKING IN on the old knife an the floor. It begins to
transform from its rusty and corroded state into a new and
shiny knife.

MUSIC UP.

A burned, skeletal hand reaches INTO FRAME and takes it.

                                             CUT TO BLACK.

                     FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962

                

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

	It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
	people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
	policemen directing traffic.

	PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS

	waiting at street corner for light to change.

	CLOSE SHOT - MAN

	at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
	sky.

	TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM

	as she follows his gaze upward.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

	MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER

	as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
	walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
	gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS

	in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
	She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
	exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
	sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
	a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
	front door of a pet shop and enters.

	INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT

	Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
	toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
	MacGRUDER, comes toward her.

				MELANIE
		Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
		seen so many gulls?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Hello, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		What do you suppose it is?

	MED. SHOT

	Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
	BARKING, o.s.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(shaking her head)
		There must be a storm at sea. That 
		can drive them inland, you know.

	They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
	and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
	are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
	birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
	birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages. As they walk:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I was hoping you'd be a little late, 
		Miss Daniels.
			(apologetically)
		You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

				MELANIE
		You said three o'clock.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I know. Oh, I know.
			(she is more distressed 
			now)
		I've been calling all morning. Oh, 
		you have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
		they're so difficult to get, really 
		they are. We get them from India, 
		you know, when they're just little 
		chicks, and then we have to...

				MELANIE
		Well, this one won't be a chick, 
		will he?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
		not. This will be a full grown myna 
		bird. Full grown.

				MELANIE
		And he'll talk?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
		You'll have to teach him to talk.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Yes.
			(pause)
		Oh my, I suppose I should call them 
		again. They said three o'clock.
			(pause)
		Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
		Would you mind waiting?

				MELANIE
			(judiciously)
		I think maybe you'd better deliver 
		him. Let me give you my address.
			(she begins taking 
			off her gloves)

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(producing pencil and 
			pad)
		Oh. Oh, well, all right.

	As Melanie starts writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I'm sure they're on the way, though.  
		Could I just call?

				MELANIE
			(with a resigned sigh)
		Well, all right, but...

	She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
	finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
	counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

				MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
		Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
		Davidson's.
			(pause; accusingly)
		It's past three, you know.
			(pause)
		Well, how long do you think...? All 
		right, would you check it please?  
		Yes, I'll wait.

	Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
	she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
	with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
	her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
	bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
	BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER

	as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
	steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
	twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
	hat.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
	strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
	The birds are startled into scarlet flight.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
	nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
	her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

				MITCH
		I wonder if you could help me.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
			(deliberately, and 
			with a touch of 
			hauteur)
		I said I wonder if you could help 
		me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
	inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
	then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
	comes to her.

				MELANIE
			(solicitously)
		Yes, what was it you were looking 
		for, sir?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(deadpan)
		Lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds, sir?

				MITCH
		Yes. I understand there are different 
		varieties, it that true?

				MELANIE
		Well... yes, sir, there are.

				MITCH
		These are for my sister... her 
		birthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
		and... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
		want a pair of birds that were too 
		demonstrative.

				MELANIE
		I understand completely, sir.

				MITCH
		As the same time, I wouldn't want 
		birds that were aloof, either.

				MELANIE
			(leading him around 
			shop)
		No, of course not.

				MITCH
		Do you have a pair that are just 
		friendly?

				MELANIE
		I think so, sir.
			(she looks around)
		Now then, let me see.

				MITCH
			(at the finches)
		Aren't these lovebirds?

				MELANIE
		No, sir, those are... redbirds.

				MITCH
		The sign says strawberry finches.

				MELANIE
			(airily)
		Yes, we call them that too.
			(she moves away)
		Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
			(and stops before a 
			cage of canaries)

				MITCH
		Those are canaries, Miss.
			(pause)
		Doesn't this make you feel awful?

				MELANIE
			(baffled)
		Doesn't what make me...?

				MITCH
		All these innocent little creatures 
		caged up like this?

				MELANIE
		Well, we can't just let them fly 
		around the shop, you know.

				MITCH
		I suppose not. Is there an 
		ornithological reason for keeping 
		them in separate cages?

				MELANIE
		Oh, certainly. It's to protect the 
		species.

				MITCH
		I imagine that's very important.  
		Especially during the moulting season.

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's a particularly dangerous 
		time.

				MITCH
		Are they moulting now?

				MELANIE
		Some of them are.

				MITCH
		How can you tell?

				MELANIE
		Well... they get a sort of hangdog 
		expression.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

				MITCH
		Yes, I see.
			(pause)
		About those lovebirds, Miss...

				MELANIE
		Are you sure you wouldn't like to 
		see a canary instead? We have some 
		very nice canaries this week.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he smiles)
		She smiles back.

				MITCH
			(he waits)
		All right, may I see one, please?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
	out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
	where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
	and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
	cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

				MELANIE
			(feebly)
		Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

	One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
	into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

				MELANIE
		Oh!  Ohhhhh!

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
	Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
	finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
	day.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
		birds is loose!

	She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
	to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
	them suspiciously.

				MITCH
		Shhh! Shhhh!

	He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
	the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the canary in his hand.

				MELANIE
		There we are!

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
	door.

				MITCH
			(putting the canary 
			in)
		Back into your gilded cage, Melanie 
		Daniels.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	startled.

				MELANIE
		What did you say?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(savoring this)
		I was merely drawing a parallel, 
		Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		But how... how do you know my name?

				MITCH
			(secretly)
		A little birdie told me.
			(he smiles politely)
		Good day, Miss Daniels.
			(he bows to Mrs.  
			MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(he starts out)

				MELANIE
		Hey, wait a minute!

	She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
	bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

				MELANIE
		I don't know you.

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I know you.

				MELANIE
		How?

				MITCH
		We met in court.

				MELANIE
		We never met in court or anyplace 
		else.

				MITCH
		That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
		you in court.

				MELANIE
		When?

				MITCH
		Do you remember one of your practical 
		jokes that resulted in the smashing 
		of a plate glass window?

				MELANIE
		I didn't break that window!

				MITCH
		No, but your little prank did. The 
		judge should have put you behind 
		bars!

				MELANIE
		What are you? A policeman?

				MITCH
		I simply believe in the law, Miss 
		Daniels, and I'm not too keen on 
		practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		What do you call your lovebird story 
		if not a practical...

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I really do want those 
		birds.

				MELANIE
		You knew I didn't work here. You 
		deliberately...

				MITCH
		Right. I recognized you when I came 
		in. I thought you might like to know 
		what it felt like to be on the other 
		end of a gag. What do you think of 
		that, Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		I think you're a louse.

				MITCH
		I am.
			(he tips his hat)
		Good day.
			(to Mrs. MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(and he goes down the 
			steps)

				MELANIE
		And I'm glad you didn't get your 
		lovebirds!

				MITCH
			(breezily, as he goes 
			out)
		I'll find something else.
			(he gives a slight 
			bow)
		See you in court some day.

	The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		That... that... who was that?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I have no idea.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She 
	looks through the glass.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	getting into his car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking after the car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She 
	begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.

	as she comes up to the counter.

				MELANIE
		Have you got a pencil?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What? Oh, yes, certainly.

	As Melanie begins writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		They said the myna bird would be 
		here later this afternoon. If you'd 
		care to come back...

				MELANIE
		No, you'd better send him. May I use 
		your phone?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(bewildered by 
			everything)
		Yes, certainly.
			(she puts phone on 
			counter)

				MELANIE
			(as she dials)
		Do you have any lovebirds?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		No, not in the shop. But I can order 
		them for you.

				MELANIE
		How soon?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well... well, how soon would you 
		want them?

				MELANIE
		Immediately.
			(into phone)
		Is this the Daily News? Melanie 
		Daniels. Would you get me the city 
		desk, please?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I might be able to have them by 
		tomorrow morning. Would that be all 
		right?

				MELANIE
			(with an edged anger)
		That would be just fine.
			(into phone)
		Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I 
		want you to do a favor for me.
			(pause)
		No, this is a small one.
			(pause)
		Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, 
		would I try to pressure you?  Will 
		you call the Department of Motor 
		Vehicles for me and find out who 
		owns this license plate? DKQ dash 
		one seven six.
			(pause)
		Yes, a California plate.
			(pause)
		No, I'll stop up there in a little 
		while. Is daddy in his office?
			(pause)
		Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in 
		on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see 
		him later. Thank you, Charlie.
			(she hangs up)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.

				MELANIE
		Now. What time tomorrow morning?

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR

	pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She 
	glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around 
	to the other side, and opens the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses 
	in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND

	running down the list of names slowly. It stops.

	INSERT - THE CARD

	her finger beside it.

	BRENNER, M. 3B

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she 
	runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then 
	does the same for the next column.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, 
	grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

	REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE

	coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly 
	toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, 
	waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
	answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the 
	elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The 
	elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows 
	her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The 
	elevator doors close.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR

	The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
	Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
	down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-
	consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. 
	The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The 
	doors begin to open.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is 
	right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The 
	man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in 
	front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn 
	the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment 
	just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. 
	He looks at Melanie.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling at him feebly.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm 
	of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie 
	watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down 
	before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND

	reaching into the purse for a white envelope.

	INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE

	written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly 
	goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Miss...?  She stops, distressed.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other 
	end, near the elevator.

				MAN
		Is that for Mitch Brenner?

				MELANIE
			(curtly)
		Yes.

				MAN
		He's not home.

				MELANIE
		That's all right.

	She presses button for the elevator.

				MAN
		He won't be back until Monday. I 
		mean, if those birds are for him....

				MELANIE
		Monday?

				MAN
		Yes. I don't think you should leave 
		them in the hall, do you?

				MELANIE
			(trapped)
		Well, I...

	The elevator doors open.

				MELANIE
		Well, where did he go?

				MAN
		Bodega Bay. He goes up there every 
		weekend.

				MELANIE
		Bodega Bay? Where's that?

				MAN
		Up on the coast. About sixty miles 
		north of here.

				MELANIE
		Sixty...
			(her face falls)
		Oh.

				MAN
		About an hour and a half on the 
		freeway. Or two if you take the coast 
		highway.

				MELANIE
		Oh.

				MAN
		I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm 
		going away myself. Someone's got to 
		feed them, I suppose.

				MELANIE
			(in utter despair now)
		Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

				MAN
			(apologetically)
		I'm awfully sorry.

	He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes 
	inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to 
	look at the birds.

	LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down 
	the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks 
	up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds 
	are COOING and CHIRPING madly.

				MELANIE
		Oh, shut up!

	And she steps into the elevator.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)

	on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
	with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
	should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
	ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
	birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
	SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns wheel forcefully.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one 
	side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car 
	rounds the curve.

	FULL SHOT - (MATTE)

	Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay.

	FULL SHOT - A CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS AT WATERFRONT

	town.

	LONG SHOT - DOCKS ON LEFT

	through the windshield as Melanie slows her speed.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - STORES

	on right of the road as Melanie enters the town. SLOW PAN 
	matching car's cruise past BAKERY, SHOE REPAIR, CLEANERS, 
	RADIO AND TELEVISION.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - THE TIDES

	past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the 
	docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)

	studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN

	through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life 
	in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with 
	their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.  
	This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- 
	is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's

	P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO 
	BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the 
	door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling 
	suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks 
	quickly toward the front door.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	enters post office.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

	behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out 
	a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not 
	look up as she approaches.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars of the cage.

				MELANIE
		Good morning.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

				CLERK
			(without looking up)
		Morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could help me.

				CLERK
		Try my best.

				MELANIE
		I'm looking for a man named Mitchell 
		Brenner.

				CLERK
		Yep.

	He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		Do you know him?

				CLERK
		Yep.

				MELANIE
		Where does he live?

				CLERK
		Right here. Bodega Bay.

				MELANIE
		Yes, but where?

				CLERK
		Right across the bay there.

				MELANIE
		Where?

	It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he 
	leaves the window.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars, exasperated.

	REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE

	as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's 
	vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the 
	Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches 
	him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if 
	he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock 
	still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then 
	that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither 
	speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at 
	her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends 
	his arm and points.

				CLERK
		See where I'm pointing?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

				CLERK (O.S.)
		See them two big trees across there?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes?

				CLERK (O.S.)
		And the white house?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		That's where the Brenners live.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

				CLERK
		Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

				MELANIE
		The two kids?

				CLERK
		Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

				MELANIE
		I see. How do I get down there?

				CLERK
		Follow the road straight through 
		town 'til it curves off on the left.  
		That'll take you right around the 
		bay to their front door.

				MELANIE
		The front door.
			(pause)
		Isn't there a back road I can take?

				CLERK
		Nope. That's the road. Straight 
		through town, stay on your left, 
		right around the bay to the front 
		door.

				MELANIE
		You see, I wanted to surprise them.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		I didn't want to come right down the 
		road, where they could see me.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		It's a surprise, you see.

				CLERK
		Mmmmmm.
			(long pause)
		'Course, you could get yourself a 
		boat, cut right across the bay with 
		it. The Brenners got a little dock 
		there you could tie up at. If that's 
		what you wanted to do.

				MELANIE
		Where would I get a boat?

				CLERK
		Down at the dock by the Tides 
		Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard 
		boat?

				MELANIE
			(looking at him)
		Of course.

				CLERK
			(looks back at her)
		D'you want me to order one for you?

				MELANIE
			(surprised)
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		What name?

				MELANIE
		Daniels.

				CLERK
		Okay.

	He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the 
	bay.

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for 
	the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up 
	and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns 
	back toward the post office.

	INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, 
	still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could tell me...

				CLERK
		Yep?

				MELANIE
		The little girl's name.

				CLERK
		The little Brenner girl?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				CLERK
		Alice, I think.
			(he turns, shouts to 
			someone in rear)
		Harry, what's the little Brenner 
		girl's name?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		What?

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		The little Brenner girl.

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Lois!

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		It's Alice, ain't it?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		No, it's Lois!

				CLERK
			(to Melanie)
		It's Alice.

				MELANIE
		Are you sure?

				CLERK
		Well, I ain't positive, if that's 
		what you mean.

				MELANIE
		I need her exact name, you see.

				CLERK
		That case, I tell you what you do.  
		You go straight through town 'til 
		you see a little hotel on your left 
		there. Not the motel, that's the 
		other end of town. This is the hotel. 
		Now you take a right turn there, you 
		got that?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

				CLERK
		Near the top of the hill, you'll see 
		the school and right behind it, the 
		church. You head for the school.  
		Now just past the school, you'll see 
		a little house with a red mail box.  
		That's where Annie Hayworth lives, 
		she's the school teacher. You ask 
		her about the little Brenner girl.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		Yep.
			(pause)
		Could save yourself a lot of trouble. 
		Her name's Alice for sure.

				MELANIE
		Can I have the boat in about twenty 
		minutes?

	The Clerk nods.

				MELANIE
		How much for the phone calls?

				CLERK
			(brushing this aside)
		It's nothing.

	LONG SHOT (MATTE) - MELANIE'S CAR turning in school road.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR

	passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX

	with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.  
	The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the 
	front door. There are white curtains in every window of the 
	house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway 
	advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting. She RINGS the bell again:

				ANNIE'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Yes? Who is it?

				MELANIE
		Me!

				ANNIE'S VOICE
		Who's me?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of 
	the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for 
	flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the 
	house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
	two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
	hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the 
	garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
	stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling 
	of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.

				MELANIE
		Miss Hayworth?

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to 
		bother you, but...

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and 
	groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She 
	studies her openly.

				ANNIE
		Yes?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		The man at the post office sent me.  
		He said you'd know the name of the 
		little Brenner girl.

				ANNIE
		Cathy?

				MELANIE
		The one who lives in the white house 
		across the bay?

				ANNIE
		That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		They seemed sure it was either Alice 
		or Lois.

				ANNIE
		Which is why the mail in this town 
		never gets delivered to the right 
		place.
			(She takes out package 
			of cigarettes, offers 
			one to Melanie)
		Did you want to see Cathy about 
		something?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	taking cigarette, hesitating.

				MELANIE
		Well... not exactly.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	studying her, thinking she understands.

				ANNIE
		Are you a friend of Mitch's?

				MELANIE
		No, not really.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She 
	puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.

				ANNIE
		I've been wanting a cigarette for 
		the past twenty minutes, but I 
		couldn't convince myself to stop.  
		This 'tilling of the soil' can get a 
		little compulsive, you know.

				MELANIE
		It's a lovely garden.

				ANNIE
		Thank you. It gives me something to 
		do with my spare time.
			(pause)
		There's a lot of spare time in Bodega 
		Bay.
			(another pause)
		Did you plan on staying long?

				MELANIE
		No. Just a few hours.

				ANNIE
		You're leaving after you see Cathy?

				MELANIE
		Well... something like that.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so 
		mysterious.

				ANNIE
		Actually, it's none of my business.

	There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it 
	is none of Annie's business.

				ANNIE
			(putting out cigarette)
		I'd better get on my way. Thank you 
		very much.

				ANNIE
		Not at all.

	They begin walking toward the car.

				ANNIE
			(still curious)
		Did you drive up from San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		It's a nice drive.
			(pause)
		Is that where you met Mitch?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating, then)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		I guess that's where everyone meets 
		him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost 
	on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her 
	face.

				MELANIE
		Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss 
		Hayworth.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie leans over the seat.

				ANNIE
		Do I?
			(she shakes her head, 
			smiles wistfully)
		No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
			(pause)
		Or maybe a closed one.
			(she smiles again, 
			sees the lovebirds)
		Pretty. What are they?

		Lovebirds.

	Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship 
	with Mitch:

				ANNIE
		Mmm.
			(pause)
		Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

	She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	coming out of Brinkmeyer's General Store, carrying a small

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR

	crossing the highway down into the parking area behind the 
	Tides, close to the docks.

	HIGH SHOT

	She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the 
	bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman. 
	She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to 
	the dock and the waiting boat.  She gets into the outboard 
	motorboat, the fisherman helping her. He hands down the 
	lovebirds in their cage.

	FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

	pulling away from the dock, heading across the bay.

	coming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She 
	cuts the motor. The motor drifts to a stop. The bay is silent 
	except for the cry of the gulls.

	LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a 
	little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and 
	a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the 
	engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the 
	truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch 
	Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this 
	distance -- and he comes over to the truck.

	The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and 
	heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust 
	behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking 
	after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up 
	toward the barn in the distance.

	The barn door closed, still no sign of Mitch.

	boat tied up at the dock. Mitch crosses the docked boat, 
	leaps into Melanie's boat.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH AND MELANIE

	in the boat.

				MITCH
		That was the damndest thing I ever

				MELANIE
		What made it...

				MITCH
		It deliberately came down at you --
		you're bleeding...

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	a thin line of blood trickling from the cut on top of her 
	head, down onto her forehead and cheek. She seems dazed.  
	She shakes her head in answer to him, then touches the top

	weakly.

				MITCH
		Come on, let's take care of that.

	FULL SHOT - THE DOCK

		What happened, Mitch?

				MITCH
			(over his shoulder)
		A gull hit her.

				FISHERMAN
		A what?

	The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they walk across the parking area 
	behind the Tides, and to the closest office. Mitch tries the 
	door knob. The door is locked.

				MITCH
		Come on, we'd better go up to the 
		restaurant.

	They walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing 
	gas station across the road, the collection of stores 
	opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door 
	for her, and they ENTER.

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of 
	a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, 
	and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
	ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
	sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall 
	of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the 
	bay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
	bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
	movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
	CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates 
	his attention between serving his customers and watching the 
	Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

	MED. SHOT - THE BAR

	Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.

				MITCH
		Deke, have you got a first aid kit 
		back there?

				DEKE
			(instantly alarmed)
		What happened?

				MITCH
		Young woman cut herself.

				DEKE
		Shall I call the doctor?

				MITCH
			(accepting the first 
			aid kit)
		I don't think it's that serious.  
		You want to sit up here?

	Melanie climbs onto the stool.

				DEKE
		You cut yourself outside, Miss?

				MITCH
		Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a 
		boat.

	He is rummaging around in the kit.

				DEKE
		I had a man trip and fall in the 
		parking lot once, sued me before I 
		could bat an eyelash.

				MITCH
		I don't think Miss Daniels is going 
		to sue anybody.

				DEKE
			(doubtfully)
		Well, you're the lawyer.
			(goes to other end of 
			bar)

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.

				MELANIE
		What's that?

				MITCH
		Just some peroxide. I want to clean 
		out the cut.

	He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the 
	cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

				MELANIE
		So you're a lawyer.

				MITCH
		That's right. What are you doing in 
		Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		Do you practice here?

				MITCH
		No, San Francisco. What are you...?

				MELANIE
		What kind of law?

				MITCH
		Criminal.

				MELANIE
		Is that why you'd like to see everyone 
		behind bars?

				MITCH
		Not everyone, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Only violators and practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		That's right.

	As he swabs cut.

				MELANIE
		Ouch!

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		What are you doing up here?

				MELANIE
		Didn't you see the lovebirds?

				MITCH
		You came all the way up here to bring 
		me those birds?

				MELANIE
		To bring your sister those birds.  
		You said it was her birthday.  
		Besides, I was coming up anyway.

				MITCH
		What for?

				MELANIE
		To see a friend of mine.
			(she winces)
		Will you please be careful?

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		Who's your friend?

				MELANIE
		Why...
			(pause, stymied)

				MITCH
		Yes?

				MELANIE
			(blurting the only 
			name she knows)
		Annie. Annie Hayworth.

				MITCH
		Well, well, small world. Annie 
		Hayworth.

				MELANIE
			(realizing this was a 
			mistake)
		Yes.

				MITCH
		How do you know Annie?

				MELANIE
			(the lie getting deeper)
		We... we went to school together.  
		College.

				MITCH
		Did you! Imagine that! How long will 
		you be staying?

				MELANIE
		Just a few... just a day or two... 
		the weekend.

				MITCH
		I think we'll have to shave the hair. 
		Deke, have you got a razor?

				MELANIE
			(pulling away)
		Oh, no you don't!

				MITCH
		It's still bleeding a little. Here, 
		let me put this on.

	He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

				MITCH
		Bend your head down. This little 
		Band-Aid won't show.

	He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a 
	mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at 
	it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

				MITCH
		So you came up to see Annie, huh?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		I don't believe you.
			(grins)
		I think you came up to see me.

				MELANIE
		Why would I want to see you, of all 
		people?

				MITCH
			(shrugging)
		I don't know. But it seems to me you 
		must have gone to a lot of trouble 
		to find out who I was, and where I 
		lived and...

				MELANIE
		It was no trouble at all. I simply 
		called my father's paper. Besides, I 
		was coming up here anyway, I already 
		told you...

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		You like me, huh?

				MELANIE
		I loathe you. You have no manners.  
		And you're arrogant and conceited 
		and... I wrote you a letter about 
		it, in fact, but I tore it up.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		None of your business.
			(pause)
		Am I still bleeding?

	She lowers her head.

				MITCH
		Can't see a thing.

				MELANIE
		I can't say I like your seagulls 
		much, either. I come all the way up 
		here to...

				MITCH
		But you were coming up anyway, 
		remember?

				MELANIE
		I was! And all I get for my pains is 
		a... a... a hole in the head!

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		Right next to the one you already 
		had.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		Look, Mr. Brenner...

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	They turn toward the door.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER

	closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a 
	woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, 
	cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking 
	about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city 
	dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

				LYDIA
			(puzzled)
		I thought I saw your car. What are 
		you doing in town?

				MITCH
			(rising to greet her)
		I had to acknowledge a delivery.
			(grins)
		Mother, I'd like you to meet...

				LYDIA
		A what?

				MITCH
			(continuing)
		Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, 
	but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the 
	introduction.

				LYDIA
		How do you do, Miss Daniels?
			(to Mitch)
		Acknowledge a what?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MITCH
		A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels 
		brought some birds from San Francisco.

	Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San 
	Francisco chippies.

				LYDIA
		Oh. I see.

				MITCH
		For Cathy. For her birthday. By the 
		way, where is she?

				LYDIA
		Across at Brinkmeyer's.

				MITCH
		Miss Daniels is staying for the 
		weekend. In fact, I've already invited 
		her to dinner tonight.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		After all, you did go to the trouble 
		of bringing up those birds.

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

	BACK TO SCENE

				LYDIA
		You did say birds?

				MITCH
		Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

				LYDIA
			(understanding 
			completely now)
		Lovebirds, I see.

				MITCH
		...get away without thanking you in 
		some small way. After all, you haven't 
		even met Cathy and you are staying 
		for the weekend...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		You are, aren't you?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, but...

				MITCH
		Then it's settled. What time is 
		dinner, Mother?

				LYDIA
		Seven o'clock, same as usual.

				MITCH
		I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.  
		Where are you staying?

				MELANIE
		With... with Annie, of course.

				MITCH
		Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter 
		to seven, will that be all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie... Annie may have made other 
		plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I 
		can find my own way.

				MITCH
		You're sure now? You won't hire a 
		boat or anything?

				MELANIE
		I'm sure.

				MITCH
		Seven o'clock then.

				MELANIE
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	grinning.

				MITCH
		We'll be waiting. How's your head 
		now?

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

	Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.

				MELANIE
			(with an overwarm 
			smile)
		It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull 
		hit me, that's all.

	Lydia stares at her doubtfully.

	EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT

	Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her 
	hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still 
	in the window. The door suddenly opens.

				ANNIE
			(surprised)
		Oh, hi!
			(pause)
		Did you find her all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		Yes, I did.

	There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at 
	Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.

				MELANIE
		I was wondering...

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		That sign.
			(pause)
		Do you think I could have the room 
		for a single night?

				ANNIE
		Well, I'd really hope to rent it 
		for...

				MELANIE
		I would appreciate it. I've tried 
		everywhere in town, and they're all 
		full.

				ANNIE
			(after a pause)
		Sure. You can have it.
			(smiles)
		Where's your bag? In the car?

	Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then 
	smiles.

				ANNIE
		It's utilitarian, I'll say that for 
		it.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I just picked up some things for the 
		night at the general store. You see, 
		I hadn't planned on spending much 
		time here.

				ANNIE
		Yes, I know. Did something unexpected 
		crop up?

	There is a moment where both women look at each other...  
	When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she 
	is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(pause)
		May I use your phone? I'd like to 
		call home.

	There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's 
	attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.

				ANNIE
		Why don't you come in then?  I was 
		just about to mix a martini.

	She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both 
	hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.

	LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS

	flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.

		Don't they ever stop migrating?

	She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.  
	She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no 
	answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In

		Hi!

				CATHY
			(excitedly)
		Hi!

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
	old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt 
	and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates 
	for just a moment.

				CATHY
		Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking 
	her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.

				CATHY
		They're beautiful! They're just what 
		I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? 
		I can't tell which is which.

				MELANIE
		Well, I suppose...

		Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm

				MITCH
		Dinner's just about ready.

		We were out back looking at the

		with them.

				LYDIA

		There's nothing wrong with those

		They're always hungry, Fred. I opened

		No, they're not fussy chickens.

		Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get 
		over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll... 
		mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred, 
		thanks.

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Lydia comes to the table. Mitch and Melanie are sitting 
	opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving 
	the last bowl of soup.

				LYDIA
			(as she sits)
		He got a call from Dan Fawcett a 
		little while ago. His chickens won't 
		eat, either.

				CATHY
		It's what you said, Mom. Mr.  
		Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

				LYDIA
			(slowly)
		No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a 
		different brand.
			(extremely worried)
		You don't think they're getting sick, 
		do you, Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her eyes troubled as she picks up her napkin.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have 
	been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are 
	carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.  
	Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is 
	playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from 
	the ashtray now and again to take a puff.

				CATHY
		I still don't understand how you 
		knew I wanted lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Your brother told me.

				LYDIA
			(as she goes into 
			kitchen)
		Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, 
		is that right?

				MELANIE
		No, not exactly.

				CATHY
		Mitch knows lots of people in San 
		Francisco. Of course, they're mostly 
		hoods.

				LYDIA
			(from the kitchen)
		Cathy!

				CATHY
		Well, Mom, he's the first to admit 
		it.
			(to Melanie)
		He spends half his day in the 
		detention cells at the Hall of 
		Justice.

				LYDIA
			(coming from kitchen)
		In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is 
		entitled to a fair trial. Your 
		brother's practice...

				CATHY
		Mom, please, I know all the democracy 
		jazz. They're still hoods.
			(to Melanie)
		He's got a client now who shot his 
		wife in the head six times. Six times, 
		can you imagine it?
			(she starts for living 
			room)
		I mean, even twice would be overdoing 
		it, don't you think?

				MELANIE
			(to Mitch as he carries 
			load of dishes out)
		Why did he shoot her?

				MITCH
		He was watching a ball game on 
		television.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
		His wife changed the channel.

	He GOES INTO kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her 
	cigarette.

				CATHY
		Is smoking fun?

				MELANIE
		Oh, I suppose so.

				CATHY
		Could I have a puff?

				MELANIE
		I don't think your mother would like 
		that.

				CATHY (O.S.)
		Just a little one.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.  
	Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes 
	a small puff.

				CATHY
			(delighted)
		Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
			(determined)
		When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like 
		a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, 
		you know.

				MELANIE
		I know.

				CATHY
		Are you coming to my party?

				MELANIE
		I don't think so.
			(seeing the child's 
			face)
		I have to get back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Don't you like us?

				MELANIE
			(touching her hair)
		Darling, of course I do!

				CATHY
		Don't you like Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		I don't know yet.

				CATHY
		Mitch likes it very much. He comes 
		up every weekend, you know, even 
		though he has his own apartment in 
		the city. He says San Francisco is 
		just an ant hill at the foot of a 
		bridge.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I guess it does get a little hectic 
		at times.

				CATHY
		If you do decide to come, don't say 
		I told you about it. It's supposed 
		to be a surprise party.

	Melanie laughs.

				CATHY
		You see, they've got this whole 
		complicated thing figured out where 
		I'm going over to Michele's for the 
		afternoon, and Michele's mother is 
		going to say she has a headache and 
		would I mind very much if she took 
		me home. Then, when we get back here, 
		all of the kids'll jump out!
			(pause)
		Won't you come? Won't you please 
		come?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.

				MELANIE
		I don't think so, Cathy.

	INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.

				LYDIA
		She's a charming girl, isn't she, 
		Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yes, very.

				LYDIA
		And certainly pretty.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		How long have you known her?

				MITCH
		I told you. We met yesterday.

				LYDIA
		In a bird shop.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		She was selling birds.

				MITCH
		No. I only led her into believing I 
		believed she was... Mother, it's 
		really very complicated.

				LYDIA
		But she did buy the lovebirds and 
		then brought them all the way...

				MITCH
		Mother, where did you go to law 
		school?

				LYDIA
			(laughing)
		Forgive me. I suppose I'm just 
		naturally curious about a girl like 
		that.
			(pause)
		She's very rich, isn't she?

				MITCH
		I suppose so. Her father owns a big 
		newspaper in San Francisco.

				LYDIA
		You'd think he could manage to keep 
		her name out of print. She's always 
		mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		She is the one who jumped into that 
		fountain in Rome last summer, isn't 
		she?

				MITCH
		Yes, Mother.

				LYDIA
		Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
			(pause)
		I know it was supposed to be very 
		warm there, Mitch, but... well...  
		actually... well, the newspaper said 
		she was naked.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		It's none of my business, of course, 
		but when you bring a girl like that 
		to...

				MITCH
		Mother?

				LYDIA
			(looking up)
		Yes?

				MITCH
		I think I can handle Melanie Daniels 
		by myself.

				LYDIA
		Well...
			(she sighs)
		So long as you know what you want, 
		Mitch.

				MITCH
		I know exactly what I want, Mother.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

	as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing 
	off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the 
	face of the moon.

				MITCH
		You'll be able to find your way back, 
		won't you?

				MELANIE
		Oh, yes.

				MELANIE
		Will I be seeing you again?

				MELANIE
		San Francisco's a long way from here.

				MITCH
		I'm in San Francisco five days a 
		week. With a lot of time on my hands. 
		I'd like to see you.
			(he grins)
		Maybe we could go swimming or 
		something. Mother tells me you like 
		to swim.

				MELANIE
		How does Mother know what I like to 
		do?

				MITCH
		I guess she and I read the same gossip 
		columns.

				MELANIE
		Oh. That. Rome.

				MITCH
		Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get 
		along very...

				MELANIE
		In case you're interested, I was 
		pushed into that fountain.

				MELANIE
		Without any clothes on?

				MELANIE
		With all my clothes on!  The newspaper 
		that ran the story happens to be a 
		rival of my father's paper.  Anything 
		they said...

				MITCH
		You were just a poor, innocent victim 
		of circumstance, huh?

				MELANIE
		I'm neither poor nor innocent, but 
		the truth of that particular...

				MITCH
		The truth is you were running around 
		with a pretty wild crowd...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		...who didn't much care for propriety 
		or convention or...

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		...the opinions of others, and you 
		went right along with them, isn't 
		that the truth?

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's the truth. But I was 
		pushed into that fountain, and that's 
		the truth, too.

				MITCH
		Sure. Do you really know Annie 
		Hayworth?

				MELANIE
		No.
			(pause)
		At least, I didn't until I came up 
		here.

				MITCH
		So you didn't go to school together.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		And you didn't come up here to see 
		her.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		You were lying.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I was lying.

				MITCH
		Did you really write a letter to me?  
		Or was that a lie, too?

				MELANIE
		I wrote the letter.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think 
		you need those lovebirds, after all.  
		They may help your personality." 
		That's what it said.

				MITCH
		But you tore it up.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		Why?

				MELANIE
		Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

				MITCH
		Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

				MELANIE
		I told you what happened in Rome!

				MITCH
		Do you expect me to believe...?

				MELANIE
		I don't give a damn what you believe!

	Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door 
	when Mitch catches it in his hands.

				MITCH
		I'd still like to see you.

				MELANIE
		Why?

				MITCH
		I think it could be fun.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	pulling the door shut.

				MELANIE
		That might have been good enough in 
		Rome last summer. But it's not good 
		enough now.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		It is for me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		But not for me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		What do you want ?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
			(angrily sarcastic)
		I thought you knew! I want to go 
		through life laughing and beautiful 
		and jumping into fountains naked!  
		Good night!

	MED. SHOT - THE CAR

	as it pulls away. Mitch yanks his hands back from the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	as he watches the car leave.

	LONG SHOT - THE ROAD

	The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the 
	long line of telephone poles and wires and... something 
	strange on the wires.

	CLOSE SHOT MITCH

	His attention caught by the poles and wires.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WIRES

	Hundreds of birds sitting on them.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	HAYWORTH

	In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, 
	absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front 
	DOOR OPENING.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels? Is that you?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes.

	Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:

				ANNIE
		Hi.
			(seeing her face)
		Is something wrong? Is that cut 
		beginning to bother you?

				MELANIE
			(touching her head)
		No, it's not the cut that's bothering 
		me.

				ANNIE
			(concerned)
		Would you like some brandy?

				MELANIE
		If you have some, I'd...

				ANNIE
		I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.  
		Do you want a sweater or something?  
		A quilt?

	As Annie gets the brandy:

				MELANIE
		No, thank you.
			(pause)
		Won't you call me Melanie?

				ANNIE
		All right.
			(she smiles)

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. 
	She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, 
	by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her 
	the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				ANNIE
			(sitting opposite her)
		It gets a little chilly here at night 
		sometimes. Especially if you're over 
		near the bay.

	Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.

				ANNIE
		Well, how'd your evening go?

	Melanie shrugs.

				ANNIE
		Did you meet Lydia?

	Melanie nods.

				ANNIE
		Or would you rather I changed the 
		subject?

				MELANIE
			(with a tired smile)
		I think so.

				ANNIE
			(nodding)
		How do you like our little hamlet?

				MELANIE
		I despise it.

				ANNIE
			(laughing)
		Well, I don't suppose it offers much 
		to the casual visitor. Unless you're 
		thrilled by a collection of shacks 
		on a hillside. It takes a while to 
		get used to.

				MELANIE
		Where are you from originally, Annie?

				ANNIE
		San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		How'd you happen to come here?

				ANNIE
		Oh, someone invited me up for the 
		weekend a long time ago.

	There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.

				ANNIE
		Look, I see no reason for being coy 
		about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

	Melanie nods.

				ANNIE
		I guess you knew that, anyway.

				MELANIE
		I suspected as much.

				ANNIE
		You needn't worry. It's over and 
		done with. A long time ago.

				MELANIE
		Annie -- there's nothing between 
		Mitch and me.

				ANNIE
		Isn't there?
			(she shrugs)
		Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's 
		never anything between Mitch and any 
		girl.

				MELANIE
		What do you mean?

				ANNIE
		I think I'll have some of that, too.
			(she pours brandy, 
			drinks, sighs)
		I was seeing quite a lot of him in 
		San Francisco, you know.
			(she smiles weakly)
		And then, one weekend, he asked me 
		up to meet Lydia.

				MELANIE
		When was this?

				ANNIE
		Four years ago. Of course, that was 
		shortly after his father died.  Things 
		may be different now.

				MELANIE
		Different?

				ANNIE
		With Lydia.
			(pause)
		Did she seem a trifle distant?

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		A trifle.

				ANNIE
		Then maybe it isn't different at 
		all. You know, her attitude nearly 
		drove me crazy. I simply couldn't 
		understand it.

				ANNIE
		When I got back to San Francisco I 
		spent days trying to figure out just 
		what I'd done to displease her.

				MELANIE
		And what had you done?

				ANNIE
		Nothing! I simply existed. So what 
		was the answer? A jealous woman, 
		right? A clinging possessive mother.
			(she shakes her head)
		Wrong. With all due respect to 
		Oedipus, I don't think that was the 
		case at all.

				MELANIE
		Then what was it?

				ANNIE
		Lydia liked me, you see. That was 
		the strange part of it. In fact, now 
		that I'm no longer a threat, we're 
		very good friends.

				MELANIE
		Then why did she object to you?

				ANNIE
		Because she was afraid.

				MELANIE
		Afraid you'd take Mitch?

				ANNIE
		Afraid I'd give Mitch.

				MELANIE
		I don't understand.

				ANNIE
		Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch 
		the only thing Lydia can give him --
		love.

				MELANIE
		Annie, that adds up to a jealous, 
		possessive woman.

				ANNIE
		No, I don't think so. She's not afraid 
		of losing her son, you see.  She's 
		only afraid of being abandoned.

				MELANIE
		Someone ought to tell her she'd be 
		gaining a daughter.

				ANNIE
		She already has a daughter.

				MELANIE
		What about Mitch? Didn't he have 
		anything to say about this?

				ANNIE
			(apologetically)
		I can understand his position. He 
		went through a lot with Lydia after 
		his father died. He didn't want to 
		risk going through it all over again.

				MELANIE
		I see.

				ANNIE
		So it ended. Not immediately, of 
		course. I went back to San Francisco, 
		and I still saw Mitch every now and 
		then... but we both knew it was 
		finished.

				MELANIE
		Then what are you doing here in Bodega 
		Bay?

				ANNIE
		You get straight to the point, don't 
		you?

				MELANIE
		I'm sorry. Forgive me.

				ANNIE
		No, that's all right, I don't mind.  
		I came up here for two reasons. To 
		begin with, I was bored with my job 
		in San Francisco. I was teaching at 
		a private school there... well, you 
		know, you probably went to one 
		yourself.

				MELANIE
		I did.

				ANNIE
		Then you know. Little girls in brown 
		beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
		I'll go into that classroom on Monday 
		morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
		five upturned little faces, and each 
		of them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
		give me what you have.'
			(pause)
		And I'll give them what I have. I 
		haven't got very much, but I'll give 
		them every ounce of it. To me, that's 
		very important. It makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time.
			(she sighs)
		That's the first reason.

				MELANIE
		And the second?

				ANNIE
			(simply)
		I wanted to be near Mitch.
			(pause)
		It was over, and I knew it, but I 
		wanted to be near him, anyway.
			(she smiles)
		You see, I still like him a hell of 
		a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
		want to lose his friendship... ever.

	There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE 
	shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer 
	it.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	at the phone.

				ANNIE
		Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't 
		asleep. What is it?
			(pause)
		Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, 
		hold on.
			(she turns to Melanie)
		It's Mitch. For you.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie 
	hesitating.

				ANNIE
		He's waiting.

	Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie 
	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
	talks to Mitch in the background.

	Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

				MELANIE
			(at phone; coolly)
		Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, 
		thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I 
		simply followed the road. It's a 
		very bright night.
			(pause)
		What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to 
		apologize. I can understand...
			(pause; she listens)
		Well...
			(she listens again)
		That's very kind of you. No, I'm not 
		angry.
			(she listens)
		I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get 
		back to San Francisco.
			(pause)
		No, I wouldn't want to disappoint 
		Cathy, but...
			(pause)
		I see.
			(she is warming)
		I see. Well, if you really...
			(pause)
		All right. Yes, I'll be there.
			(pause)
		Good night, Mitch.

	She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.

				MELANIE
		He wants me to go to Cathy's party 
		tomorrow afternoon.
			(pause)
		I said I would.

				ANNIE
		I'll be going, too, to help out. It 
		should be fun, Melanie.

				MELANIE
		It seems so pointless.
			(she sighs)
		I think I'll go to sleep. This has 
		been a busy day.
			(picking up her paper 
			bag)
		My luggage.

	She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

				ANNIE
		Pretty. Did you get that at 
		Brinkmeyer's?

	Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent 
	for a moment, pensive. Then:

				MELANIE
		Do you think I should go?

				ANNIE
		That's up to you.

				MELANIE
		It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

				ANNIE
		Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

				MELANIE
			(firmly)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		Then go.

	The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

				MELANIE
		Thank you, Annie.

	Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, 
	startling them both.

				ANNIE
			(rising)
		Who can that be at this hour?
			(she walks to door)
		Who is it?
			(no answer)
		Is someone there?

	Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks 
	the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  
	There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

				ANNIE
			(to the emptiness 
			outside)
		Is anyone there?

				MELANIE
			(pointing to the ground)
		Look.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
			(sympathetically)
		Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably 
		lost his way in the dark.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.  
	And then, slowly:

				MELANIE
		But... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's 
		a full moon.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and 
	consternation:

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with 
	balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. 
	The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are 
	clustered around a long folding table upon which are 
	sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
	helping the children to more or telling them they are having 
	too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
	LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
	are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
	away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
	bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
	entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
	The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, 
	the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the 
	CAMERA out to the left.

	CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES

	Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and 
	stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one 
	of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one 
	of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

				MELANIE
		I really shouldn't have any more.  
		I'm a little tipsy already.

				MITCH
		I'm trying to get you to stay for 
		dinner. We're going to have a lot of 
		roast left over.

				MELANIE
		I couldn't possibly. I have to get 
		back.

				MITCH
			(with a shrug)
		Cheers.

				MELANIE
		Cheers.

	They drink.

				MELANIE
		What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?

				MITCH
		Why do you have to rush off? What's 
		so important in San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Well... I have to get to work tomorrow 
		morning, for one thing.

				MITCH
			(surprised)
		You have a job?

				MELANIE
			(sipping at the martini)
		I have several jobs.

				MITCH
		What do you do?

				MELANIE
		I do different things on different 
		days.

				MITCH
		Like what?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating)
		On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work 
		for the Travelers' Aid. At the 
		airport.

				MITCH
		Helping travelers.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

	She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really 
	considered before what she does with her time, and now that 
	she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant.

				MELANIE
		And on Tuesdays, I take a course in 
		General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's 
		not a job, of course. I just take it 
		because...

				MITCH
		What about Thursdays and Fridays?

				MELANIE
		On Thursdays I have my meeting and 
		lunch.
			(pause)
		I'm chairman of a group that's sending 
		a little Korean boy through school.  
		We plan how to raise funds and... 
		things like that.
			(she shrugs)

				MITCH
		And Fridays? What do you do then?

				MELANIE
		Nothing.
			(she smiles)
		I go to bird shops on Fridays.

				MITCH
		I'm glad you do.

				MELANIE
		Do you know what I was doing in that 
		shop?

				MITCH
		What?

				MELANIE
		I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. 
		She's seventy years old, and veddy 
		prim and strait-laced.
			(she does an imitation)
		She's coming back from Europe at the 
		end of the month, and I'm going to 
		give her a myna bird that'll talk to 
		her.

				MITCH
		What'll it say?

				MELANIE
			(facetiously)
		You'll think me very bold, sir.

				MITCH
		No, tell me.

	She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
	LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
	Melanie's face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	serious, introspective.

				MELANIE
		That's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a 
		bird to shock my aunt. That's just 
		silly and childish.
			(slight pause)
		Maybe I ought to go join the other 
		children.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where 
	the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch 
	stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse 
	of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children 
	are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold 
	from Michele to Cathy.

	CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH

	The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We 
	see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by 
	way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
	OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
	children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
	this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching Mitch and Melanie.

	MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this 
	moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday 
	cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also 
	catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat 
	as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. 
	During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy 
	off.

				ANNIE
		All right then, here we go.
			(she spins her)
		Once!
			(she spins her again)
		Twice!
			(she spins her again)
		Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!

	She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as 
	though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  
	Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:

				LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
		Look! Look!

	Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as 
	she looks up.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	A gull is swooping down.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously 
	reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly 
	swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.

				CATHY
		No touching allowed!

	She almost falls.

	FULL SHOT - THE GULL

	seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then 
	returns.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as 
	she ducks with two gulls swooping by.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round 
	to the front of it.

	FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	Annie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children 
	are running in the background.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	reacting to two more gulls diving.

	FULL SHOT - TWO GULLS - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	diving toward the children.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY

	She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks.

	TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS

	as a gull swoops between them.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	coming out of the house with a broom.

	TWO GULLS

	swooping down at the children's heads.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	swinging at gull and missing.

	LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	running toward bank. Gull swooping after him.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into 
	him.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank.

	THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY

	They look up.

	LONG SHOT - THE GULLS

	against the sky, flying away in formation.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no 
	longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to 
	Melanie.

				MITCH
		Are you all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
			(coming over)
		That's the darnest thing thing I've 
		ever seen in my life.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				LYDIA
		Are they gone?

				MITCH
		They're gone, Mother.

	FULL SHOT - THE LAWN

	as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the 
	cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck 
	very close by without having injured anyone. All that 
	adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

				LYDIA
		Well... well, is everyone all right?

				MITCH
			(with a small boy)
		I think he got a little scratch, 
		Mother.

				GIRL #3
		Did you see them? They were hawks!

				GIRL #4
		They were bigger than hawks!

				ANNIE
		Children, they were only seagulls.

	And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, 
	and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent 
	meaningful glance.

	BACK TO SCENE

				CATHY
		They must have been after the food, 
		Mother.

	They all turn toward the table.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE, 
	UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	eyes narrowed.

				MITCH
		They didn't touch anything.

	BACK TO SCENE

				ANNIE
			(trying to restore 
			order)
		Well, they're gone now, so... so 
		let's...
			(pause)
		Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't 
		you, Cathy?

				GIRL #2
		Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.

				MITCH
		You look a little shaken.

				MELANIE
		I... I am.
			(pause)
		Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, 
		is it? The gull yesterday when I was 
		in the boat, and the one last night 
		at Annie's, and now...

				MITCH
		Last night? What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		A gull smashed into Annie's front 
		door.
			(pause)
		Mitch... what's happening?

				MITCH
			(concerned)
		I don't know, Melanie.
			(pause)
		Look, do you have to go back to 
		Annie's?

				MELANIE
		No, I have my things in the car.

				MITCH
			(gently)
		Then stay and have something to eat 
		before you start back. I'd feel a 
		lot better.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND 

	He is slicing the leftover roast beef.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to 
	call into living room. The lovebirds in their cage are making 
	a terrible racket.

				MITCH
		Do you want some mustard with this?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		No, thank you.

				CATHY
			(coming from kitchen)
		Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

				MITCH
		She said something about having to 
		get home to take a call from her 
		mother back East.

				CATHY
		Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?

				MITCH
		Take it into the living room, would 
		you, hon?

				CATHY
			(seeing the birds)
		What's the matter with them?

	Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some 
	French bread.

				LYDIA
		What's the matter with all the birds?

	She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still 
	tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, 
	and then signs heavily.

				LYDIA
		Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm 
		sure Miss Daniels wants to get on 
		her way.

	As she moves into the living room.

				CATHY
		I think you ought to stay the night, 
		Melanie.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a sharp look at her daughter.

	MED. SHOT - CATHY

	pouring coffee into the cups set on coffee table.

				CATHY
		We've got an extra room upstairs and 
		everything.

				MITCH
			(coming in with two 
			plates)
		That road can be a bad one at night, 
		Melanie.
			(he picks up coffee 
			cup, hands it to 
			Melanie)

	They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet 
	style.

				MELANIE
		If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll 
		come onto the freeway much earlier.

				LYDIA
			(picking up a cup)
		Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, 
		isn't it, Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that 
		traffic going back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Did you put the cover on that cage, 
		Mom?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I did.

				CATHY
		Just listen to them!

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Some cream?

				MELANIE
		I'll get it.

	She reaches over for the cream pitcher. Her eye is caught by 
	something in the fireplace.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking curiously.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	a single swift is sitting on the hearth.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning to Mitch.

				MELANIE
		Mitch...

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	as dozens of swifts begin pouring from the opening.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened now.

	hundreds of birds pouring into the room.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	shrieking in terror, dropping her coffee cup.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	reaching for small fireplace broom.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	shrieking as the birds dive at her face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	realizing it's impossible to run. They must stay and fight.

				MITCH
			(shouting)
		Cathy, get some matches!

	MED. SHOT - CATHY

	running for the kitchen. Birds swooping after her.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the fireplace broom.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds 
	coming out of the opening. He stuffs paper under the logs 
	already in place there.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering 
	in her hair, caught there.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the broom, covered with birds.

	MED. SHOT - A PICTURE ON THE WALL

	(an enlargement of a photograph of Cathy, smiling.) As a

	MED. SHOT - CATHY

	running into the room, covering her face with bent arm, 
	rushing to Mitch with the box of matches.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	taking the matches. He lights one. A bird hits his arm. He 
	drops the match. He lights another one.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE MATCH

	falling onto the paper in the fireplace. It flickers for a 
	moment, then catches. Birds are still pouring out, past the 
	paper beginning to catch.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE

	as a bird crashes through it.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head. She is 
	hysterics now, BABBLING. The SHRIEK of the birds is a wild 
	cacophony.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE

	blazing.

	MED. SHOT - A BIRD

	swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	the birds leaving en masse now.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	A shambles. Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND

	reaching down to pick up a dead bird.

	MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY

	a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out 
	speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the 
	palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.

				MALONE
		That's a chimney swift, all right.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		We know what it is, Al.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.

				MALONE
		Well, these birds live in chimneys, 
		you know.

				MITCH
		Not by the thousands.

				MALONE
		No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
			(pause)
		Did you have a light burning or 
		something.

				MITCH
		Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

				MALONE
		'Cause sometimes birds are attracted 
		by light, you know.
			(pause)
		Sure is a peculiar thing.

				MITCH
		What are we going to do about it, 
		Al?

				MALONE
		I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do 
		about what?

				MITCH
		Well...
			(he feels a little 
			foolish)
		Well... these birds attacked us.

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	slight disbelief on his face.

				MALONE
		What's more likely, they got in the 
		room and was just panicked, that's 
		all.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
			(still a little 
			hesitant)
		All right, I'll grant you a bird'll 
		panic in an enclosed room. But, they 
		didn't just get in. They came in! 
		Right down that chimney.

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
			(trying to make sense 
			of this)
		My wife found a bird in the back 
		seat of her car once.

				MALONE
			(shrugs)
		Didn't know how he got in there.  
		Had a broken leg, turned out. Just 
		fluttering all around there.
			(he shrugs again)

				MITCH
		These birds were...

				MALONE
		What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is 
		these things happen sometimes, you 
		know? Ain't much we can do about it.
			(he shrugs)

				LYDIA
		Tell him about the party.

				MITCH
		That's right. We had a party here 
		this afternoon for Cathy. Her 
		birthday.

				MALONE
		Oh, yeah, yeah.
			(he grins)
		How old is she now?

				MITCH
		Eleven. In the middle of the party, 
		some gulls came down at the children. 
		And Miss Daniels was attacked by a 
		gull just yesterday after...

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	considering this.

				MALONE
		Yeah.
			(thinking)
		Were the kids bothering them or 
		something? 'Cause sometimes they'll 
		do that, you know. If you make any 
		kind of disturbance near them, they'll 
		just come after you. I seen that 
		plenty of times myself.

	TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		The children were playing a game, 
		Al. Those gulls attacked without...

				MALONE
		Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty 
		strong word, don't you think? I mean, 
		birds just don't go around attacking 
		people without no reason, you know 
		what I mean? The kids just probably 
		scared them, that's all.

				LYDIA
		These birds attacked!

				MALONE
			(nodding)
		Well, what would you like me to do, 
		Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on 
		any suspicious birds in the area?
			(he smiles)
		Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't 
		it?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		Does this room look silly?

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
		No, you got quite a mess here, I'll 
		admit that.
			(pause)
		Maybe you oughta put some screening 
		on top of your chimney
			(pause)
		Seems a little pointless, though.  
		Freak accident like this wouldn't 
		happen again in a million years.
			(pause)
		You want some help cleaning up?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	exasperated.

				MITCH
		I can handle it myself.

	putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders.

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
		Well, if there's anything else I can

				MITCH
		Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.

				MALONE
		Goodnight, Lydia.

	No answer.

				MALONE
		Sure is peculiar, I got to say that 
		for it.

	He exits.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still

	utter helplessness.

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather 
	unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store.  Her 
	hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a 
	lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is 
	busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS 
	VOICES.

	 

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to 
		drop Cathy off now.

				MITCH'S VOICE
		Okay.

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		I'll probably drive over to the 
		Fawcett farm. Do you need anything 
		in town?

				MITCH'S VOICE
		No.

	Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window 
	and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck 
	starting.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck 
	and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the 
	road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA 
	FOLLOWING. She opens the door.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	There is no answer.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. 
	The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops 
	at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on 
	her face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds 
	TWEET at her.

				MELANIE
			(imitating them)
		Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is 
	an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.  
	She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then 
	peers out of the side window.

	LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin 
	column of smoke is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to 
	put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She 
	picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the 
	cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee 
	and then breathes deeply of the air.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE

	fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have 
	not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke 
	is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the 
	end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off 
	the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the 
	sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs 
	as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky 
	for a moment.

	SLOW PAN

	as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in 
	sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in 
	its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin 
	column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and 
	raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts 
	the rake down and begins walking toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch 
	coming toward her, her eyes glowing.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	closer to the house now.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting, anticipating.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR 
	CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the 
	garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS 
	again. She turns.

	Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing 
	a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wanted to change my shirt.

	Melanie is uncomprehending.

				MITCH
		It smelled of the fire.

				MELANIE
			(nodding)
		It's hard to believe anything at all 
		happened yesterday, isn't it? It's 
		so beautiful and still now.
			(pause; then sagely)
		I think I've got it all figured out, 
		by the way.

				MITCH
		Really? Tell me about it.

				MELANIE
			(secretively)
		It's an uprising.

				MITCH
		Of birds?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, of birds.

	Mitch grins.

				MELANIE
		It all started several months ago 
		with a peasant sparrow up in the 
		hills, a malcontent. He went around 
		telling all the other sparrows that 
		human beings weren't fit to rule 
		this planet, preaching wherever anyone 
		would listen...

				MITCH
		Growing a beard...

				MELANIE
			(delighted)
		Yes, of course, he had to have a 
		beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' 
		he kept saying, over and over...

				MITCH
		So they united.

				MELANIE
		Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows 
		out for kicks...

				MITCH
		Well, they'll go along with anything.

				MELANIE
		Sure. But eventually, even the more 
		serious-minded birds began to listen.  
		"Why should humans rule?" they asked
		 themselves.

				MITCH
		Hear!

				MELANIE
		Why should we submit ourselves to 
		their domination?

				MITCH
		Hear, hear!

				MELANIE
		And all the while, that sparrow was 
		getting in his little messages.  
		Birds of the world, unite!

				MITCH
		Take wing!

				MELANIE
		You have nothing to lose but your 
		feathers.

	They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then 
	laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly 
	still.

				MITCH
			(attempting to be 
			serious)
		What it was, probably...

				MELANIE
		Mmm?

				MITCH
		They're probably hungry, that's all.  
		This was a bad summer. They eat 
		berries and... and nuts, you know, 
		and the hills are all burned out, so 
		they're probably searching for food 
		wherever they can get it.

				MELANIE
		With my little sparrow leading team.

	She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.  
	Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror 
	story, they are becoming a little frightened.

				MITCH
		It's so damn quiet out there.

				MELANIE
		It was like that yesterday.

				MITCH
		What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		After the gulls attacked.

				MITCH
		I hadn't thought of that.
			(pause)
		And then the swifts came.

				MELANIE
		It makes you feel as if they're... 
		they're waiting or... resting... 
		or....

				MITCH
			(trying to make it 
			light again)
		No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. 
		Your sparrow is standing on a soap 
		box and...

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face dead serious.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		...waving his little wings...

	His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the 
	garden is silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming 
	slowly and with the chill of horror on them.

				MELANIE
		They were angry, Mitch. They came 
		out of the chimney in fury.
			(pause)
		I had the feeling they wanted each 
		and every one of us dead.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes 
	to him longingly.

				MITCH
		Melanie, Melanie...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened, Mitch.

				MITCH
		No, no...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened and confused and I... 
		I think I want to go back to San 
		Francisco where there are buildings 
		and... and concrete and...

				MITCH
		Melanie...

				MELANIE
		...everything I know.

	She looks up at him suddenly.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		Oh damn it, why did you have to walk 
		into that shop?

	They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

	EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK

	Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name 
	of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate.  
	Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She 
	knocks. There is no answer.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a 
	little away from the house.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	There is no answer. She shades her eyes and looks out over 
	the fields.

	LONG SHOT - FARMHAND ON TRACTOR

	FULL SHOT - THE BARNYARD

	as Lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth.

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		Hi, there!

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND

	He stops the tractor, turns toward Lydia, shading his eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		Is Mr. Fawcett home?

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND

				FARMHAND
			(shouting back)
		I think so, ma'm. His missus is in

				LYDIA
		Have you seen him this morning?

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND FARMHAND

	No, ma'm. I reckon he's in there, though.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(shouting it)
		Thank you!

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	as she crosses the barnyard again. There are several chickens 
	scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag 
	of feed lying against the fence.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	getting an idea.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the 
	ground.

				LYDIA
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.  
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN

	He struts up to the scattered grain.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	watching him.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN

	He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from 
	it and struts off.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction 
	strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.  
	In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you home?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window 
	closest to the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW

	A small pane of glass is broken.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	puzzled.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	going to the front door, trying the knob.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the 
	house.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	The house is still and silent.

	INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT

	as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the 
	right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her 
	left and looks down a long corridor.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial 
	light into the corridor.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she 
	should leave. A determined look comes over her face.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the 
	opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you in there?

	No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing 
	the door open.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.

	SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and 
	continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A 
	standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still 
	burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass 
	shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane 
	of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its 
	top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped 
	out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near 
	decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, 
	all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, 
	and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, 
	continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its 
	PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single 
	bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, 
	one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately 

							  CUTS TO:

	CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT

	His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their 
	empty staring sockets.  Immediately

							   CUT TO:

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a terrified scream erupting from her mouth.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in 
	an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she 
	is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips 
	her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still 
	screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she 
	backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

	CAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.

	FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK

	at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the 
	highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite 
	direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV

	through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend 
	leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, 
	there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in 
	the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and 
	barrels into the front yard.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck 
	just as it jerks to a stop.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia.

		What is it?

	INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.  
	She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set 
	with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the 
	kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		That was Al on the phone. He wants 
		me to meet him out at the Fawcett 
		place. Says some detectives from 
		Santa Rosa'll be there in a little 
		while.
			(pause)
		Will you be all right here?

				MELANIE
		Yes. I was just taking her in some 
		tea.

	He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses 
	her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to 
	him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.

				MELANIE
		Be careful. Please.

	She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, 
	full kiss.

	FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN

	as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and 
	then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his 
	car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, 
	through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on 
	the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM

	This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a 
	life no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead 
	husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of 
	Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct 
	femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing 
	the tray.

				MELANIE
		No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought 
		you might like some tea.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

				LYDIA
		Oh, thank you.

	There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, 
	arranges the pillows behind Lydia.

				LYDIA
		Where's Mitch?

				MELANIE
		Al Malone wanted him out at the 
		Fawcett farm.

				LYDIA
		Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

				MELANIE
		He was calling from the farm, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Then he saw.

				MELANIE
		He must have. He sent for the Santa 
		Rosa police.

				LYDIA
		What good will they do?

	She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie 
	walks to the window and looks out over the bay.

				LYDIA
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		What?

				LYDIA
		Cathy. At the school.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression 
	clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all 
	right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting 
	smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Do I sound foolish to you?

				MELANIE
		No.

				LYDIA
		I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
			(she shudders)
		They have such big windows at the 
		school.
			(pause)
		All the windows were broken. In Dan's 
		bedroom. All the windows.

				MELANIE
		Try not to think of that, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		I wish I were a stronger person.  
		There is a long awkward silence. She 
		sips at her tea reflectively.

				LYDIA
		I lost my husband four years ago, 
		you know.
			(pause)
		It's odd how you depend on someone 
		for strength, and then suddenly all 
		the strength is gone, and you're 
		alone.
			(pause)
		I'd love to relax some time. I'd 
		love to be able to sleep.
			(pause; the worried 
			look again)
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie's there. She'll be all right.

				LYDIA
		I'm not this way, you know. Not 
		usually. I don't fuss and fret over 
		my children.
			(pause)
		When Frank died...
			(pause)
		You see, he knew the children, he 
		really knew them. He had the knack 
		of being able to enter into their 
		world, of becoming a part of them.  
		That's a rare talent.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		I wish I could be that way.

	There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in 
	this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her 
	husband's death, is discussing it with another person.  
	Curiously, the person is Melanie.

				LYDIA
			(honestly and simply)
		I miss him.
			(pause)
		You know, sometimes I wake up in the 
		morning, and I think 'I have to make 
		Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get 
		up and there's a... a very good reason 
		for getting out of bed until... until, 
		of course, I remember.
			(pause)
		I miss talking to him.
			(pause)
		Cathy's a child, you know, and 
		Mitch...
			(she shrugs a little 
			sadly)
		...Mitch has his own life.
			(pause)
		I'm glad he stayed here today. I 
		feel safer with him here.
			(she sighs deeply)

				MELANIE
		Would you like to rest now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		No.  No... don't go yet.
			(pause)
		I feel as if I... I don't understand 
		you. And I want so much to understand.

				MELANIE
		Why, Mrs. Brenner?

				LYDIA
		Because my son is...
			(pause)
		My son seems to be fond of you.
			(pause)
		And I...
			(pause)
		I'm not quite sure how I feel about 
		it. I really don't know if I... like 
		you or not.

				MELANIE
		Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?  
		You liking me?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I think so. My son is important 
		to me. I want to like any girl he 
		chooses.

				MELANIE
		And if you don't?

				LYDIA
			(with a faint smile)
		Then I don't suppose it'll matter 
		much to anyone but me.

				MELANIE
		I think it might also matter to Mitch.

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		Mitch has always done exactly what 
		he wanted to do.
			(pause)
		I'm not complaining. That's the mark 
		of a man.  But...
			(pause)
		You see, I... I wouldn't want to 
		be... be left alone. I don't think I 
		could bear being left alone.  I... 
		forgive me. This business with the 
		birds has me upset.  I... I don't 
		know what I'd do if Mitch weren't 
		here.

				MELANIE
			(going to the bed; 
			adjusting the pillow)
		Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
			(sighing)
		I wish I were stronger.
			(she pauses and looks 
			toward the window.)
		Do you think she's all right? Do you 
		think she's safe at the school?

				MELANIE
		Would you like me to go for her?

				LYDIA
		I couldn't ask you to.

				MELANIE
		I don't mind, really.

				LYDIA
		Would you? I'd feel so much better.

				MELANIE
		I'll just clear up here, and then 
		dress.

	She picks up the tray and starts for the door.

				LYDIA
		Melanie?

	At the door, Melanie turns.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her face soft.

				LYDIA
			(gently)
		Thank you for the tea.

	door and looks in.

	leading the children in song. She catches sight of Melanie 
	at the door. Melanie wiggles her fingers. Annie points to 
	her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few 
	minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.  
	Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.

	EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT

	Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house.  
	Inside the children are still singing.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)

	Again five more crows arrive.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is 
	no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing 
	inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her 
	cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the 
	school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time 
	so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going 
	on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what 
	seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is 
	drawn to something above her.

	MED. SHOT - SKY

	She is almost looking into the play yard.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	A crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS it down, we see for the first time that the number 
	of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or 
	even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.

				ANNIE
		All right now.

	from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly 
	INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of 
	the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.

				MELANIE
		We've got to get the children out of 
		here. These big windows... there's 
		no way to board them up.

	Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves 
	restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.

				ANNIE
		Quiet down, children! Quiet down!

	The children modulate into silence.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels wants to see how we 
		conduct ourselves during a fire drill. 
		I'd like you to...

				CHILDREN
			(grumbling in Unison)
		A fire drill? This is our play period, 
		Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc.

				ANNIE
		I'd like you to show her how quiet 
		and obedient you can be.

	The children again fall silent.

				ANNIE
		We're going to go out of the school 
		now. Those of you who live nearby 
		can go directly home. I want the 
		rest of you to go down the hill, all 
		the way to the hotel. Do you 
		understand?

				CHILDREN
		All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss 
		Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do 
		we...?

				ANNIE
			(shushing them)
		I want you to go as quietly as you 
		can, not a sound, until I tell you 
		to run. And then I want you to run 
		as fast as you can. Does everyone 
		understand?
			(pause - silence)
		All right. John, would you lead the 
		class, please?

	The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens 
	it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the 
	play yard.

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as 
	DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his 
	wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A 
	DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of 
	booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in 
	his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and 
	efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another 
	table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing 
	and clowning around throughout following at a table in the 
	rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the 
	counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.  
	Over her head, the television set is blasting with its 
	perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

				MELANIE
		Daddy, there were hundreds of them.  
		No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying 
		to tell you this as calmly as I know 
		how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
			(she takes a deep 
			breath)
		Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes 
		ago.

	The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing 
	walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking 
	woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through 
	foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what 
	Melanie is saying.

				MELANIE
		At the school. No, I don't. Just a 
		minute.
			(to Deke)
		What's the name of the school?

				DEKE
		Just the Bodega Bay School.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Help you, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I need some change, Mr. Carter.

	As Deke opens cash register...

				MELANIE
		The Bodega Bay School.
			(to Deke)
		Could you turn that down, please?

	Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.

				MELANIE
		I don't know how many children.
		Thirty or forty. Yes.

	Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to 
	Melanie.

				MELANIE
		No, the birds didn't attack until 
		the children were outside the school. 
		Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. 
		Is there a difference between crows 
		and blackbirds?

				MRS. BUNDY
			(turning from machine)
		There is very definitely a difference, 
		Miss.

				MELANIE
		They're different, Daddy.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Thank you.
			(into phone)
		I think these were crows. Yes, 
		hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked 
		the children, attacked them.
			(exasperated)
		Daddy, a little girl was sent to the 
		hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all 
		right, but you act as if I'm... all 
		right, all right.
			(pause)
		No, I can't come home now. I just 
		can't, Daddy. How is it there? I 
		mean... are there birds? In the sky?  
		But no trouble. Well, I hope...
			(pause)
		I don't know when. I simply can't 
		leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.  
		All right, Daddy, good-by.

	She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They're both perching birds, of 
		course, but of quite different 
		species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. 
		The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.
			(to Deke)
		Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

				DEKE
		In the book right here, Miss.

	As Melanie looks it up...

				DEKE
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		I don't see what difference it makes, 
		Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If 
		they attacked the school, that's 
		pretty serious.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(with a superior smile)
		I hardly think either species would 
		have the intelligence to launch a 
		massed attack. Their brain pans aren't 
		large enough for such...

				MELANIE
			(dialing)
		I just came from the school, madam.  
		I don't know about their brain pans 
		but...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not aggressive creatures, 
		Miss. They bring beauty to the world. 
		It is mankind, rather, who...

				HELEN
			(going to door leading 
			to kitchen)
		Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.  
		Baked potato on all of them.

	LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

				MELANIE
			(into phone)
		Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, 
		please?
			(pause)
		Yes, I'll wait.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(continuing to Deke)
		...insist on making it difficult for 
		life to survive on this planet. If 
		it weren't for birds...

				DEKE
		Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to 
		understand. This young lady says 
		there was an attack on the school.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Impossible.

				MELANIE
			(in background)
		Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.  
		Something terrible has happened.

	Her background conversation continues through following:

				DRUNK
			(suddenly)
		It's the end of the world!

				HELEN
		What's this about the school?

				DEKE
		Bunch of crows attacked the school, 
		Helen.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.
			(suddenly quoting)
		"Thus saith the Lord God to the 
		mountains, and to the hills, to the 
		rivers and to the valleys; Behold, 
		I, even I, will bring a sword upon 
		you, and I will destroy your high 
		places.

				HELEN
		The Lord's not destroying anything, 
		Jason.

				DRUNK
		"In all your dwelling places, the 
		cities shall be laid waste, and the 
		high places shall be laid waste!"
			(he nods)
		Ezekiel, Chapter six.

				HELEN
			(quoting)
		"Woe unto them that rise up early in 
		the morning that they may follow 
		strong drink."

				DRUNK
			(nodding)
		Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of 
		the world.

				MELANIE
		Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.  
		Good-by.
			(she hangs up)

				MRS. BUNDY
			(laughing)
		I hardly think a few birds are going 
		to bring about the end of the world.

				MELANIE
			(turning to her)
		These weren't a few birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN

	waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; 
	becoming very nervous.

	BACK TO SCENE

				DEKE
		I didn't even know there were many 
		crows in Bodega Bay this time of 
		year.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The crow is a permanent resident 
		throughout its range. In fact, during 
		our Christmas Count, we recorded...

	CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES

	eating.

				SHOLES
			(suddenly, from his 
			table)
		How many gulls did you count, Mrs.  
		Bundy?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MRS. BUNDY
		Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are 
		several varieties.

				SHOLES
		The ones that've been raising the 
		devil with my fishing boats.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Probably herring gulls. They arrive 
		in November, you know, and don't 
		migrate North again until March or...

				MELANIE
			(leaping upon this)
		Have you had trouble with gulls?

				SHOLES
		One of my boats did last week.

				DEKE
			(making a connection)
		This young lady got hit by a gull 
		only Saturday.

				SAM'S VOICE
			(from kitchen)
		Pick up the chicken.

				HELEN
		Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was 
		crows.
			(she picks up tray, 
			shrugs, goes to table)
		Deke, I'm still waiting for those 
		Bloody Marys!

				DEKE
		Coming right up!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really 
	frightened.

				WOMAN
		Could you ask them to lower their 
		voices, please? They're frightening 
		the children.

				LITTLE GIRL
		Timmy has a canary.

				HELEN
		That's nice. Are you Timmy?

				LITTLE BOY
		My cousin is Timmy.

	BACK TO SCENE

				SAM'S VOICE
			(leaving table, coming 
			to bar)
		A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized 
		one of my boats.  Practically tore 
		of the skipper's arm.

				HELEN
			(coming back)
		You're scaring the kids. Keep it 
		low.

				DEKE
		You're scaring me, too. Are you trying 
		to say all these...
			(he shakes his head)
		That sounds impossible, Sebastian.

				SHOLES
		I'm only telling you what happened 
		to my boat.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The gulls were after your fish, Mr.  
		Sholes. Really, let's be logical 
		about this.

				MELANIE
		What were the crows after at the 
		school?

				MRS. BUNDY
		What do you think they were after, 
		Miss...?

				MELANIE
		Daniels. I think they were after the 
		children.

				MRS. BUNDY
		For what purpose?

				MELANIE
		To...
			(she hesitates)
		To kill them.

	There is a long silence.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Why?

	Another silence.

				MELANIE
		I don't know why.

				MRS. BUNDY
		I thought not. Birds have been on 
		this planet since archaeopteryx, 
		Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty 
		million years ago!

	A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait 
		all that time to start a... a war 
		against humanity?

				MELANIE
		No one called it a war!

				SALESMAN
		Scotch, light on the water.

				MRS. BUNDY
		You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying 
		as much.

				HELEN
		Are you finished here, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
		Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Who said anything about war? All I 
		said was that some gulls...

				HELEN
			(yelling to kitchen)
		One apple pie! You want more coffee?

				SHOLES
		No. ...came down on one of my boats.  
		They could have been after the fish, 
		just as you said.

				SALESMAN
		Your captain should have shot at 
		them.

				SHOLES
		What?

				SALESMAN
		Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most 
		birds are. If you ask me, we should 
		wipe them all out. World would be 
		better off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(outraged)
		Birds?

				SALESMAN
		Yeah, birds. All they do is make a 
		mess of everything. Who needs them?

				MRS. BUNDY
		We need them.

				SALESMAN
		Not if they're starting a war.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They are incapable of organized 
		warfare!

				MELANIE
		Have you ever seen a jay protecting 
		a nest?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I have seen jays doing everything it 
		is conceivable for jays to do.  
		Ornithology happens to be my 
		avocation, Miss Daniels. You're 
		talking about preservation of the 
		species, a hen protecting her young.  
		There's a vast difference between...

				MELANIE
		Maybe they're all protecting the 
		species. Maybe they're tired of being 
		shot at and roasted in ovens and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Are you discussing gamebirds now?  
		All birds are not gamebirds, you 
		know.

				MELANIE
		I don't know anything about birds 
		except that they're attacking this 
		town.

				SALESMAN
		Then fight back. Get yourselves guns 
		and wipe them off the face of the 
		earth.

				MRS. BUNDY
		That would hardly be possible.

				DEKE
		Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Because there are 8,650 species of 
		birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. 
		It's estimated that five billion, 
		seven hundred and fifty million birds 
		live in the United States alone. The 
		five continents of the world...

				SALESMAN
			(muttering)
		Kill them all. Get rid of them.  
		Messy animals.

				MRS. BUNDY
		...probably contain more than a 
		hundred billion birds!

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world!

				DEKE
		Well, we seem to have more than our 
		share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.  
		Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe 
		they've all gone crazy.

				HELEN
		Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want 
		it at the table?

				SHOLES
		No. Here's fine.
			(he begins eating)

				HELEN
		Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?

				DEKE
		Coming.

				HELEN
			(angrily)
		Are we running a business here -- or 
		a bird sanctuary?

				SHOLES
			(beginning to change 
			his mind)
		Actually, those gulls must have been 
		after the fish.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course.

				SHOLES
		Makes a lot more sense than... well, 
		an attack.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course it does. If we believe 
		that birds are attacking, why... why 
		next we'll believe that grasshoppers 
		and cockroaches are capable of...

				DRUNK
		Cockroaches!  Urghh!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	getting more and more anxious.

				WOMAN
		Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.

				BOY
		Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

				SHOLES
		Maybe we're all getting a little 
		carried away by this. Admittedly, a 
		few birds acted strangely. That's no 
		reason to believe...

				MELANIE
		This isn't a few birds! I keep telling 
		you that! These are gulls and swifts 
		and crows and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

				MELANIE
		Maybe! Is it impossible?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Yes. I have never known birds of 
		different species to flock together.  
		The very concept is unimaginable.
			(laughing)
		Why if that happened, we wouldn't 
		have a chance. How could we possible 
		hope to fight them?

				SHOLES
		We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.  
		Bundy.

				WOMAN
			(calling from table)
		Excuse me, may I have a check, please?

				HELEN
			(concerned)
		Is everything all right, ma'am?

				WOMAN
		Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the 
		road.

				SAM
			(coming from kitchen)
		What's the matter? Something wrong 
		out here?

				DEKE
		Nothing's wrong.

				SAM
		All this shouting.

				MRS. BUNDY
		We're fighting a war, Sam.

				SAM
		A war? Against who? Did the 
		Russians...?

				SHOLES
		Against birds.

				WOMAN
			(suddenly)
		I'm glad you all think this is so 
		amusing. You've frightened my children 
		half out of their wits.

				BOY
		I'm not scared, Mommy.

				WOMAN
		Keep quiet. If that young lady saw 
		an attack on the school, why won't 
		you believe her?

				SAM
		What attack? Who attacked the school?

				WOMAN
		Birds did. Crows! And you're all 
		sitting around here debating! What 
		do you want them to do next? Crash 
		through that window?

				LITTLE GIRL
			(frightened by her 
			mother)
		Mommy!

				WOMAN
		Quiet! Why don't you all get home?  
		Lock your doors and windows!
			(her hysteria rising)
		Put on your coats, children!
			(to Deke)
		What's the fastest road to San 
		Francisco?

				DEKE
		The freeway, ma'am.

				WOMAN
		Where do I get it?

				SALESMAN
		I'm going out that way, lady. You 
		can follow me.

				WOMAN
		Then let's go. Now!

				SALESMAN
		I haven't finished my drink.

				WOMAN
			(on edge of panic, 
			shouting at her 
			children)
		Put on your coats! Do you want to 
		get trapped here?

				BOY
		I can't find my scarf.

				WOMAN
		Look in your sleeve!

	The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.

				MITCH
		Melanie?

	At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.

				MITCH
			(going to her)
		I got here as fast as I could.  
		Where's Cathy?

				MELANIE
		At Annie's house. She's all right.

				SAM
		Al, why aren't you over there where 
		the attack was?

				MALONE
		Because I just got back from Dan 
		Fawcett's place, that's why.

				MITCH
		He was killed last night. By birds.

				MALONE
		Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know 
		that for a fact.

				MRS. BUNDY
		What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

				MALONE
		Santa Rosa police think it was a 
		felony murder. They think a burglar 
		broke in and killed him.

				WOMAN
		Were the Santa Rosa police at your 
		school today?
			(impatiently, to 
			salesman)
		Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		Take it easy, lady.
			(through window)
		There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

				DRUNK
			(quoting)
		"Look at the birds of the air: they 
		do not sow or read, yet your heavenly 
		father feeds them."

				WOMAN
		I'll never feed another bird as long 
		as I live!

				SALESMAN
		Something like this happened in Santa 
		Cruz last year. The town was covered 
		with seagulls.

				WOMAN
		Can't you please finish your drink?

				MRS. BUNDY
		That's right, sir, I recall it. A 
		large flock of seagulls got lost in 
		a fog and headed in for the town, 
		where all the lights were.

				SALESMAN
		They made some mess, too, smashing 
		into houses and everything.
			(shaking his head)
		They always make a mess. We're better 
		off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The point is that no one seemed to 
		get upset about it. They were gone 
		the next morning, just as if nothing 
		at all had happened. Poor things.

				WOMAN
		I'm leaving! Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		All right, all right!
			(he downs his drink)
		Hope you figure this out, folks.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.

	The Tides is silent for a moment.

				SHOLES
		Well, I'd better get back to the 
		cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

				DEKE
		Let's see. Scallops and coffee...

				MITCH
		Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.

	Sholes turns to him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face very serious.

				MITCH
		Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

				SHOLES
		No one ever said you were, Mitch.

				MITCH
			(flatly)
		I think we're in trouble. I don't 
		know how or why this started, but I 
		know it's here and I know we'd be 
		crazy to ignore it.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(sarcastically)
		Ignore what? The bird war?

				MITCH
			(exploding)
		Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, 
		the bird plague, you can call it 
		what you want to, they're out there 
		massing someplace and they'll be 
		back, you can count on that!

				MRS. BUNDY
		Ridiculous!

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home 
		and polish your binoculars?

				SAM
		Go on, Mitch.

				MITCH
		If we don't do something now, if we 
		don't get Bodega Bay on the move...

				SHOLES
		Look, Mitch, even if this is true, 
		even if all the birds...

				MITCH
		Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
			(after a long pause)
		No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't 
		see any reason for it.

				MITCH
		It's happening. Isn't that a good 
		enough reason?

				SHOLES
			(thoughtfully)
		I like Bodega Bay as well as any 
		man. If I thought...
			(he shakes his head)

				MITCH
		Then help me, Sebastian. You're an 
		important man in this town. If you'll 
		help, the rest will.

				SHOLES
		Help how? What do you want to do?

				MITCH
		I'm not sure, but...

				SHOLES
		If you don't even know what you want 
		to do...

				MELANIE
		Listen to him, please.

				SAM
			(taking position beside 
			Melanie)
		You listen to him, Sebastian!

				MITCH
		I only know we've got to drive them 
		away from town -- before they drive 
		us away.

				SHOLES
		How?

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, you said something about 
		Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting 
		lost in the fog, and heading in for 
		the lights.

				DEKE
		We don't have any fog this time of 
		year, Mitch.

				MITCH
		We'll make our own fog.

				SHOLES
		How do you plan to do that?

				MITCH
		With smoke.

				MALONE
		There's an ordinance against burning 
		anything in this town, unless it's...

				MITCH
		We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army 
		uses.

				DEKE
		What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad 
		as birds.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not bad!

				SHOLES
		How can we go on living here if we 
		blanket the town with smoke?

				MITCH
		Can we go on living here otherwise?

	Pause. They are silent.

				SAM
			(slowly)
		It's worth a try, Sebastian.

	There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:

				MELANIE
		Look!

	They turn toward the window.

	TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT

	Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or 
	four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of 
	the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the 
	window and out to the left.

				DEKE
			(alarmed)
		Gulls!

				MITCH
		They're back!

				SHOLES
		They're only the usual... What are 
		you...

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the 
	attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is 
	seen disappearing into the men's room.

	INT. TIDES

	A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the 
	Tides Restaurant.

	TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT

	A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man 
	on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and 
	then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out 
	and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep 
	by.  The gas begins to flow away.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie 
	after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see 
	people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas 
	station. At the door, Mitch turns.

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Stay back in here.

	Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.  
	They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at 
	the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the 
	window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to 
	rescue the attacked gas station attendant.

	Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter 
	away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in 
	the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks 
	down.

	TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT

	on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is 
	flowing to the right into the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE

	flowing down to the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.

	MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS

	along the flowing gas back to the station.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She turns back to the car park.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked 
	below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, 
	has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of 
	lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the 
	happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn 
	attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the 
	man.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As 
	he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and 
	he drops it.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her horror-stricken face.

	FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA

	Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's 
	car, and the one next to it go up in flames.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	TURNING TO SEE

	FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

	The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, 
	following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, 
	which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured 
	attendant.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT

	A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the 
	town rushing around the car park and the streets across the 
	highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see 
	automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil 
	smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the 
	parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and 
	have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the 
	foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill 
	with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes 
	obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop 
	down on the town.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone 
	booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing 
	out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin 
	to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the 
	restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:

				MELANIE
		Mitch...! Mitch!

	We see her look up to the sky.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	The sky is full of seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again 
	to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in 
	the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE

	slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all 
	around her.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people 
	who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with 
	clouds of birds coming on them.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her 
	eyes for Mitch.

	MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the 
	direction of the car park.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water 
	from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning 
	cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around 
	them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her eyes turn up quickly.

	LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.  
	Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner 
	coming toward her in the phone booth.  We can see birds flying 
	in and out of the windows of the car.  We can see the arm 
	and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the 
	background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

	CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	as the car comes toward her in the booth.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.

	CLOSER SHOT

	A side view of the car after practically scraping the side 
	of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the 
	driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently 
	give us a view of its interior.

	FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	watching the car.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It 
	explodes.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no 
	avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down 
	and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight 
	turn, now sees:

	THE TIDES TOWN

	The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop 
	their hose.

	CLOSER SHOT

	shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the 
	water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows 
	of the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window 
	she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the 
	left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its 
	palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and 
	leaping and kicking its van to pieces.

	At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of 
	a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.  
	His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are 
	covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.  
	Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides 
	Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, 
	the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and 
	waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of 
	recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls 
	crash around the booth causing her to go back.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE

	looking out again toward Mitch.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction 
	while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning 
	building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. 
	Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the 
	smoking building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking across in horror.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly 
	Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls 
	down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, 
	another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the 
	window as Mitch drops the child.

	FLASH - MELANIE

	watching this breathlessly.

	CLOSER SHOT

	The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.  
	He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the 
	windows. They disappear into the building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	holding her breath.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	getting more desperate.

	CLOSEUP - BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window 
	and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	sees her and starts running toward the booth.

	HIGH SHOT - MITCH

	beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.

	LOW SHOT

	close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag 
	Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the 
	CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.

	INT. THE TIDES

	There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the 
	windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The 
	CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very 
	hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.  
	There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can 
	hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a 
	woman's voice SCREAMS out:

				WOMAN
		Why are they doing it?! Why are they 
		doing it...?!

	Some of the heads of the group turn.

	CLOSE SHOT

	It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.  
	Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and 
	helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some 
	words.

				MRS. BUNDY
			([Mrs. Bundy offers a 
			weak explanation of 
			why the birds could 
			have gone berserk 
			like this. This 
			information should 
			be obtained from Dr. 
			Stager.])

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over 
	their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.

				MITCH
			(looking up)
		I think they're going.

	Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud 
	CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.

	MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, 
	we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has 
	gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who 
	are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the 
	window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the 
	street.

				MITCH
		I think it's safe to get out now.

				MELANIE
		Don't let's take any chances.

				MITCH
		We've got to get Cathy.

	They open the door and make their way out into the street, 
	running and looking about them desperately.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched 
	on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the 
	sidewalk.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as 
	they move along past the last street and come into the more 
	countrified part of the town.

	LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD

	We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which 
	we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the 
	school roof.

	SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks 
	up, Melanie following his look.

	SKY SHOT - FULL

	of wheeling gulls.

	SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the 
	school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

	There are a few blackbirds on it.

				MELANIE'S VOICE
		Look... the crows again.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.

				MELANIE
		Careful, Mitch. The crows may be 
		back in the play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play 
	yard, we see what they see.

	MED. SHOT

	THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of 
	crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	They walk stealthily past.

	CLOSE SHOT

	CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they 
	approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over 
	her shoulder toward the crows.

	EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

	Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE

	A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the 
	door.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He reaches the body. He rolls it over.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	dead.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	The shock registering on his face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment 
	what Mitch's reaction will be.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's 
	face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket 
	and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to 
	keep her warm. He turns away then.

	MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW

	with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, 
	with her eyes peering at something outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning to follow Cathy's gaze.

	CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS

	Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD

	As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at 
	the birds. Melanie dashes forward.

				MELANIE
			(as the birds flutter 
			into the air)
		Mitch! Don't!

	She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he 
	maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are 
	now hovering flight.

				MELANIE
		Please! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of 
		here!

	Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the 
	house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a 
	state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds 
	Cathy to her.

	CLOSER THREE SHOT

	as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.

				MELANIE
		Mitch, you can't leave her out there.

	He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder 
	is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and 
	then a door is CLOSED.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer 
	in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

	MED. SHOT

	He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the 
	three of them as they silently make their way past the crows 
	once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out 
	cautiously to the right.

	MED. SHOT

	CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.

	BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE

	They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.

	MED. SHOT

	Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE

	The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go 
	toward the waiting car.

	MED. SHOT

	They arrive at the car.

				MELANIE
		You drive, Mitch.

	She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch 
	slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the 
	CAMERA and goes down the school road.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie 
	looks over her shoulder.

				MELANIE
			(holding her breath)
		I don't think they're coming.

	Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes 
	wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then 
	suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as 
	the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.

				CATHY
		On our way back from taking Michele 
		home... we... we heard the explosion 
		and went outside to... see what... 
		what it was.
			(pause)
		All at once the... the birds were 
		everywhere. All at once.  She... she 
		pushed me inside and... they covered 
		her.
			(pause)
		Annie.
			(pause)
		She pushed me inside.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.

							  DISSOLVE

	CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA 
	TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings 
	to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues 
	low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting 
	there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, 
	not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the 
	Brenner house in the distance.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed 
	across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two 
	attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

	LONG SHOT - THE BAY

	covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is 
	still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where 
	the ladder leans against the side of the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, 
	carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She 
	is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is 
	not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her 
	hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked 
	with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there 
	is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she 
	stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

				MELANIE
		The town looks clear.

				MITCH
		The bay doesn't.

				MELANIE
		How long have they been gathering 
		there?

				MITCH
		The past fifteen minutes.
			(pause)
		It seems to be a pattern, doesn't 
		it? They strike and disappear, and 
		then they start massing again.

	Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.

				MELANIE
		I keep thinking of Annie.
			(she squeezes her 
			eyes shut)

				MITCH
			(after a long pause)
		It... it doesn't look very different, 
		does it? A little smoke over the 
		town, but otherwise...

				MELANIE
			(looking)
		Even the birds sitting out there.  
		It does look very much the same, 
		Mitch. This could be last week.

				MITCH
		It may not be last week again for a 
		long long time.

	They are both silent.

				MELANIE
		Look. They're still coming.

	Mitch nods. Silence.

				MITCH
		Do you want to try your father again?
			(Melanie shakes her 
			head.  Puzzled, Mitch 
			looks at her)

				MELANIE
		I tried a little while ago. The 
		phone's dead.

				MITCH
		Have we still got power?

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(leaning against him)
		I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very 
		tired.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch! I'm getting something on the 
		radio!

	INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

	Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a 
	footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the 
	room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from 
	the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

				LYDIA
		I can't get any of the local stations.  
		I think this is San Francisco.

				ANNOUNCER
		...would include formulation of a 
		central financing committee to handle 
		credit and to allocate responsibility 
		for the various facets of the project. 
		A vote on the motion is expected 
		early tomorrow morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	listening.

				ANNOUNCER
		Continuing with the local news, police 
		are still investigating the series 
		of valuable jade burglaries in the 
		Chinatown area. The round-up of known 
		criminals has not as yet produced a 
		suspect, but Commissioner Nelson 
		said today he was certain the 
		burglaries were quote linked and the 
		work of the team of professionals 
		unquote.
			(pause)
		In Bodega Bay early this morning, a 
		large flock of crows attacked a group 
		of children who were leaving the 
		school during a fire drill. One little 
		girl was seriously injured and taken 
		to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but 
		the majority of children reached 
		safety in the town.
			(pause)
		On the national scene today, the 
		opening of the new session of Congress 
		was marked by a State of the Union 
		address that...

				MITCH
		Is that all?

				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		...drew a standing ovation for the 
		President. The Chief Executive, in 
		discussing our relation to Europe 
		and the rest of the world community 
		said: "These various elements of our 
		foreign policy lead as I have said 
		to a single goal --

				MITCH
			(sighing)
		We're going to need more wood for 
		the fire. We can't let it go out.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing as drone 
			in background)
		The goal of a peaceful world of free 
		and independent states.  This is our 
		guide for the present and our vision 
		for the future -- a free community 
		of nations, independent but 
		interdependent, uniting north and 
		south, east and west, in one great 
		family of man, outgrowing and 
		transcending the hates and fears 
		that rend our age.  We will not reach 
		that goal today or tomorrow.  We may 
		not reach it in our lifetime.  But 
		the quest is the great adventure of 
		our century.  We sometimes chafe at 
		the burdens of our obligations, the 
		complexity of our decisions, the 
		agony of our choices, but there is 
		no comfort or security for us in 
		evasion, no solution in abdication, 
		no relief in irresponsibility.
			(pause)
		In assuming the tasks of the 
		Presidency, I said that few 
		generations, in all history, had 
		been granted the role of being the 
		great defender of freedom in its 
		hour of maximum danger.  This is our 
		good fortune, and I welcome it now 
		as I did when I first took office.
			(pause)
		For it is the fate of this generation -- 
		Of you in the Congress and of me as 
		President -- to live with a struggle 
		we did not start, in a world we did -
		not make. But the pressures of life 
		are not always distributed by choice. 
		And while no nation has ever faced 
		such a challenge, no nation has ever 
		been ready to seize the burden and 
		the glory of...

				LYDIA
			(pause)
		Did you you get the windows in the 
		attic, Mitch?

				MITCH
		 I got them all, Mother.

				LYDIA
		When do you think they'll come?

				MITCH
		I don't know.

				LYDIA
		If there are... larger birds, Mitch... 
		they'll get into the house.

				MITCH
		That's a chance we have to take.

				LYDIA
		Maybe we ought to leave.

				MITCH
		Not now.  Not while they're massing 
		out there.

				LYDIA
		When? 

				MITCH
		I don't know when.  We'll see what...

				LYDIA
		Where will we go?

				MITCH
		I don't know yet.  I think we'll be 
		safe here.
			(Pause)
		Let's bring that wood in.

				LYDIA
		What happens when we run out of wood?

	Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and 
	long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the 
	tension being played in front of it.

				MITCH
		I don't know. We'll break up the 
		furni...

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		You don't know, you don't know!  
		When will you know? When we're all 
		dead? Like Annie?

				CATHY

		Mother!

		If your father were here...

				MITCH

		Mother! I'm trying my best!

		I'm... trying... my...

		I'm sorry, Mitch.

	FULL SHOT - HOUSE

	as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.  
	There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they 
	begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly 
	scan the sky.

	FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS

	flying in tight formation.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Where are they heading?

				MITCH
		Inland.

				MELANIE
		Santa Rosa?

				MITCH
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. 
	It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa 
	Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.

				MITCH (O.S.)
			(gently)
		Come on. Let's get this wood in.

	Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and 
	her eyes remain on the sky.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we 
	can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the 
	sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.  
	There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, 
	kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace 
	putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room 
	and dumps another load.

				MELANIE
		That's the last of it.

				LYDIA
		Did you close the door?

				MELANIE
		And locked it.

				CATHY
		Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in 
		here?

				LYDIA
			(snapping it)
		No!

				CATHY
		Mom, they're in a cage!

				LYDIA
		They're birds!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.

				MITCH
			(softly)
		Let them stay in the other room.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent 
	except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more 
	wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still 
	are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in 
	the house.

				CATHY
		Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The 
		birds.

				MITCH
			(putting wood on fire)
		I don't know, honey.

				CATHY
		Why are they trying to kill people?

				MITCH
		I wish I could say. But if I could 
		answer that, I could also tell you 
		why people are trying to kill people.

	The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the 
	lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall 
	silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, 
	her eyes widening.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of 
	their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of 
	splintering glass.

				LYDIA
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhh.

	Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, 
	the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes 
	of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards 
	and the outside of the house begins building, almost like 
	muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. 
	Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, 
	is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section 
	entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the 
	roof.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She 
	squeezes her eyes shut.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, 
	there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat

	of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
	tat. Tat-

				CATHY
			(in terror)
		I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I 
		want to throw...

	Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.

				MELANIE
		I'll go with you.

	They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR 
	Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling 
	of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of 
	birds striking the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the 
	birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his 
	watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back 
	door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
	dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  
	He cannot tell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a 
	NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing 
	sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	coming into the entry hall.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR

	The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside 
	assail the door.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining 
	room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it 
	toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and 
	piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, 
	CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags 
	it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table 
	when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with 
	alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is 
	and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of 
	desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The 
	CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din 
	now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

				MELANIE
		When will they stop?

				MITCH
		I thought they'd have stopped by 
		now.

				MELANIE
		What time is it?

				MITCH
		Almost two a.m.

				MELANIE
		You must be exhausted.

				MITCH
		How about you?

	She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their 
	cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready 
	to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the 
	chair, goes to the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the birds, wondering.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their 
	expressions. Malice or benevolence?

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	watching, unmoving.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER

	as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  
	One of them tweets.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wonder if Cathy fed them.

	He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, 
	takes out a small box of bird feed.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE

	as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  
	His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
	small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
	Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
	The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
	small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
	in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
	tweeting, they begin to eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
	against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  
	Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, 
	pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

				MITCH
			(holding her)
		You should have left when you wanted 
		to.

	She shakes her head.

				MITCH
		You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		I don't want to be safe. I want to 
		be with you.

	There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like 
	a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, 
	Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand 
	in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of 
	night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

				MITCH
			(in the darkness)
		The power.

				MELANIE
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Wait here. Don't move.

	The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the 
	blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the 
	SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes 
	on.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as 
	he directs the beam upwards.

				MITCH
		We'd better light some of those lamps.

				MELANIE
		No... wait.
			(pause)
		Hold me.

	In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is 
	almost black in the room except for the strange effect of 
	the flashlight as he holds it behind her.

				MITCH
		I think they're easing off.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the 
	fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep 
	on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  
	Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly 
	and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer 
	the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another 
	SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a 
	steady dribbling, difficult to place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.

				MELANIE
			(whispering)
		Mitch?

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns toward him.

				MELANIE
			(still whispering)
		Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	asleep.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming 
	from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, 
	picks up a very long flashlight.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the 
	entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled 
	against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into 
	the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam 
	on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor 
	outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, 
	goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's 
	all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second 
	bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first 
	door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light 
	on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, 
	goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to 
	the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back 
	toward the door when she stops.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR

	a pile of chipped and broken plaster.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING

	A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, 
	and suddenly, her eyes open wide.

	CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL

	sitting in the darkness, staring at her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	reacting.

	QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL

	wings spread in the beam of light.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering 
	back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the

	FULL SHOT - THE CEILING

	a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward 
	her.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds 
	attack her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is 
	a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering 
	wings.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie, open the door!

	He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie 
	struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed 
	by the birds.

	She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the 
	spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering 
	of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault 
	on the door by Mitch outside.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
			(screaming)
		Mitch, get her out of there!

	MED. SHOT - THE ROOM

	Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in 
	view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see 
	on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	The door begins to open.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He 
	begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for 
	Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins 
	dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been 
	shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  
	We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch 
	pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut 
	behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at 
	the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

				MITCH
		Mother, get a rope!

				LYDIA
		Oh, my God, look at her!

				MITCH
			(shouting)
		Get a rope!

	She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  
	There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He 
	will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his 
	hand, knocking the club from it.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his 
	hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  
	Another bird flutters into the corridor.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his 
	hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and 
	is immediately attacked by the other bird.

				MITCH
			(yelling)
		Mother! Hurry!

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a 
	heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily 
	to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and 
	compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the 
	doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
	the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to 
	Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia 
	following. As they go downstairs:

				MITCH
		Cathy! Get a blanket and some 
		bandages!

				CATHY
			(at the foot of the 
			stars, on the verge 
			of tears)
		Is she all right?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

				MELANIE
		I'm... I'm....

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the 
	couch.

				MITCH
		Just lie there and keep still.

	Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  
	By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over 
	Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands 
	are trembling, and he drops it.

				LYDIA
		Let me do that, Mitch.

	She picks up the bandage.

				MITCH
		I can handle it.

				LYDIA
		I know you can.
			(her eyes meet his)
		But I'd like to.

	He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Please don't mess me up with bandages, 
		Mrs. Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Shhhh. Shhhh.

				MELANIE
		Please.

	But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the 
	cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

				LYDIA
			(as she works)
		I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

				MITCH
		You're doing fine.

				LYDIA
			(Apologizing)
		I mean. I want to...

	Pause.

				CATHY
		Listen!

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to 
	hear.

				LYDIA
		They're gone. God have mercy, they're 
		gone.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the 
	table and chair. He opens the door a crack.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD

	through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no 
	birds visible.

	FULL SHOT - THE DOOR

	from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred 
	and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds 
	spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is 
	directly behind him.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	a shambles, all the windows broken.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				MITCH
		They're gone. The same pattern.

				LYDIA
		But they'll be back.

				MITCH
		We won't be here.

				LYDIA
		Where can we go, Mitch? There's no 
		place to go.

				MITCH
		I want to try for San Francisco.  
		There are buildings there. Steel and 
		concrete!

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		We'd never make it. They're probably 
		all over the road.

				MITCH
		We have to try it.
			(a long silence)
		We can't stay here.
			(silence)
		Melanie needs help.
			(silence)
		Mother, the house won't take another 
		attack.

				LYDIA
		If...
			(pause)
		If... when we get to San Francisco...
			(pause)
		If they're already there?

				MITCH
		They won't be.

				LYDIA
		If they are?

				MITCH
		We'll worry about that when we get 
		there.

				LYDIA
		I'm frightened, terribly frightened.  
		I... I don't know what's out there, 
		Mitch.

				MITCH
		What do we have to know, Mother?  
		We're all together, we all love each 
		other, we all need each other. What 
		else is there? Mother, I want us to 
		stay alive!

				LYDIA
			(nodding; then after 
			a pause)
		I started to say... inside...

				MITCH
		You don't have to.

	He holds out his hand to her.

				MITCH
		I think we'd better get started.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD

	It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before 
	dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following 
	until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is 
	deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's 
	convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house 
	together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the 
	back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background 
	is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia 
	comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking 
	down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the 
	house.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just 
	outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking back at her.

	FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA

	Across the expanse of the desolated yard.

				CATHY
		May I take them, Mitch?

	He does not answer. She continues looking at him.

				CATHY
		They haven't harmed anyone.

				LYDIA
		Take them.

				MITCH
			(with a slow nod)
		We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

	He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  
	The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front 
	seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, 
	and looks toward the trees.

	MED. SHOT - THE TREES

	covered with waiting birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	getting into car.

				MITCH
		Be careful with that door.

	Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch 
	does the same with his door.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Mitch, if they hear the car 
		starting... if they see movement...

				MITCH
		We'll take it slow until we get to 
		the main road.
			(pause)
		Are you ready?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND

	turning the key. The motor springs to life.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	anticipation on all the faces.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he takes a deep breath)
		Here we go.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is 
	still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it 
	passes the gate and starts down the road.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small 
	fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  
	The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the 
	road.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW

	She gasps quickly.

	MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE

	standing, waiting silently.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	as the tension begins to starts.

				MITCH
		Shhh.  Shhhh.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with 
	waiting seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning toward the side of the road ahead.

	FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	covered with waiting birds.

				CATHY
			(whispering)
		Mitch, let's turn back.

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhhhh.

	MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE

	as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front 
	porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his 
	hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded 
	window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	reacting.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.

	as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding 
	road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
	standing wires, watching, waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as 
	the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of 
	birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every 
	pole, on every fence.

				LYDIA
		Mitch!

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as he stops the car and looks ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened, try not to reveal her fear.

				MELANIE
		Can we turn back?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		I... I don't think so. If we get 
		through town, I think we'll be all 
		right.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest 
	reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, 
	who makes the decision.

				MELANIE
		Then go ahead, Mitch.

	FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR

	as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow 
	rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	as she turns to look out the window on her side.

	CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS

	as the car moves past them slowly.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	closing her eyes.

	FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE

	through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with 
	birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all 
	over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the 
	open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the 
	gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken 
	windows.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH

	The tension on their faces,

	MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES

	as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and

	More slashes, more light in scattered beams.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the 
	memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the 
	owl.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the 
	incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(almost a prayer)
		Dear God... dear God... please, 
		please, what have we done? Please.
			(and then in anger at 
			the roof and the 
			birds)
		Can't they leave us alone?
			(shrieking it)
		LEAVE US ALONE!

	MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof 
	suddenly rips back.

	FULL SHOT - BIRDS

	from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof 
	tears back.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds, 
	and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around 
	Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	racing along as the birds hover over it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks 
	as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.

	FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR

	streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in 
	the road.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)

	It is arrow-straight, no curves.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins 
	to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds 
	attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into 
	them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They 
	are well ahead of the birds now.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		We're losing them.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	only a nod, his face streaming tears.

	LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)

	as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the 
	distance.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release 
	of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles 
	Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening, 
	looks ahead through the windshield.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR

	all their faces visible.

				CATHY
		Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll 
		be all right? In the trunk? Can they 
		breath?

				MITCH
			(with the faintest 
			smile)
		I think they'll be all right, honey.

	There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the 
	wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.  
	They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint 
	their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches 
	up to turn down the sun visor.

				MITCH
		It looks... it looks clear up ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise 
	over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the 
	distance it goes.

                     FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962

                

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

	It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
	people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
	policemen directing traffic.

	PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS

	waiting at street corner for light to change.

	CLOSE SHOT - MAN

	at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
	sky.

	TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM

	as she follows his gaze upward.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

	MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER

	as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
	walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
	gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS

	in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
	She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
	exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
	sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
	a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
	front door of a pet shop and enters.

	INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT

	Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
	toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
	MacGRUDER, comes toward her.

				MELANIE
		Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
		seen so many gulls?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Hello, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		What do you suppose it is?

	MED. SHOT

	Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
	BARKING, o.s.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(shaking her head)
		There must be a storm at sea. That 
		can drive them inland, you know.

	They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
	and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
	are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
	birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
	birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages. As they walk:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I was hoping you'd be a little late, 
		Miss Daniels.
			(apologetically)
		You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

				MELANIE
		You said three o'clock.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I know. Oh, I know.
			(she is more distressed 
			now)
		I've been calling all morning. Oh, 
		you have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
		they're so difficult to get, really 
		they are. We get them from India, 
		you know, when they're just little 
		chicks, and then we have to...

				MELANIE
		Well, this one won't be a chick, 
		will he?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
		not. This will be a full grown myna 
		bird. Full grown.

				MELANIE
		And he'll talk?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
		You'll have to teach him to talk.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Yes.
			(pause)
		Oh my, I suppose I should call them 
		again. They said three o'clock.
			(pause)
		Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
		Would you mind waiting?

				MELANIE
			(judiciously)
		I think maybe you'd better deliver 
		him. Let me give you my address.
			(she begins taking 
			off her gloves)

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(producing pencil and 
			pad)
		Oh. Oh, well, all right.

	As Melanie starts writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I'm sure they're on the way, though.  
		Could I just call?

				MELANIE
			(with a resigned sigh)
		Well, all right, but...

	She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
	finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
	counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

				MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
		Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
		Davidson's.
			(pause; accusingly)
		It's past three, you know.
			(pause)
		Well, how long do you think...? All 
		right, would you check it please?  
		Yes, I'll wait.

	Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
	she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
	with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
	her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
	bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
	BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER

	as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
	steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
	twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
	hat.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
	strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
	The birds are startled into scarlet flight.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
	nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
	her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

				MITCH
		I wonder if you could help me.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
			(deliberately, and 
			with a touch of 
			hauteur)
		I said I wonder if you could help 
		me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
	inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
	then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
	comes to her.

				MELANIE
			(solicitously)
		Yes, what was it you were looking 
		for, sir?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(deadpan)
		Lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds, sir?

				MITCH
		Yes. I understand there are different 
		varieties, it that true?

				MELANIE
		Well... yes, sir, there are.

				MITCH
		These are for my sister... her 
		birthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
		and... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
		want a pair of birds that were too 
		demonstrative.

				MELANIE
		I understand completely, sir.

				MITCH
		As the same time, I wouldn't want 
		birds that were aloof, either.

				MELANIE
			(leading him around 
			shop)
		No, of course not.

				MITCH
		Do you have a pair that are just 
		friendly?

				MELANIE
		I think so, sir.
			(she looks around)
		Now then, let me see.

				MITCH
			(at the finches)
		Aren't these lovebirds?

				MELANIE
		No, sir, those are... redbirds.

				MITCH
		The sign says strawberry finches.

				MELANIE
			(airily)
		Yes, we call them that too.
			(she moves away)
		Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
			(and stops before a 
			cage of canaries)

				MITCH
		Those are canaries, Miss.
			(pause)
		Doesn't this make you feel awful?

				MELANIE
			(baffled)
		Doesn't what make me...?

				MITCH
		All these innocent little creatures 
		caged up like this?

				MELANIE
		Well, we can't just let them fly 
		around the shop, you know.

				MITCH
		I suppose not. Is there an 
		ornithological reason for keeping 
		them in separate cages?

				MELANIE
		Oh, certainly. It's to protect the 
		species.

				MITCH
		I imagine that's very important.  
		Especially during the moulting season.

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's a particularly dangerous 
		time.

				MITCH
		Are they moulting now?

				MELANIE
		Some of them are.

				MITCH
		How can you tell?

				MELANIE
		Well... they get a sort of hangdog 
		expression.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

				MITCH
		Yes, I see.
			(pause)
		About those lovebirds, Miss...

				MELANIE
		Are you sure you wouldn't like to 
		see a canary instead? We have some 
		very nice canaries this week.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he smiles)
		She smiles back.

				MITCH
			(he waits)
		All right, may I see one, please?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
	out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
	where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
	and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
	cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

				MELANIE
			(feebly)
		Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

	One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
	into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

				MELANIE
		Oh!  Ohhhhh!

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
	Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
	finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
	day.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
		birds is loose!

	She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
	to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
	them suspiciously.

				MITCH
		Shhh! Shhhh!

	He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
	the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the canary in his hand.

				MELANIE
		There we are!

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
	door.

				MITCH
			(putting the canary 
			in)
		Back into your gilded cage, Melanie 
		Daniels.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	startled.

				MELANIE
		What did you say?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(savoring this)
		I was merely drawing a parallel, 
		Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		But how... how do you know my name?

				MITCH
			(secretly)
		A little birdie told me.
			(he smiles politely)
		Good day, Miss Daniels.
			(he bows to Mrs.  
			MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(he starts out)

				MELANIE
		Hey, wait a minute!

	She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
	bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

				MELANIE
		I don't know you.

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I know you.

				MELANIE
		How?

				MITCH
		We met in court.

				MELANIE
		We never met in court or anyplace 
		else.

				MITCH
		That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
		you in court.

				MELANIE
		When?

				MITCH
		Do you remember one of your practical 
		jokes that resulted in the smashing 
		of a plate glass window?

				MELANIE
		I didn't break that window!

				MITCH
		No, but your little prank did. The 
		judge should have put you behind 
		bars!

				MELANIE
		What are you? A policeman?

				MITCH
		I simply believe in the law, Miss 
		Daniels, and I'm not too keen on 
		practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		What do you call your lovebird story 
		if not a practical...

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I really do want those 
		birds.

				MELANIE
		You knew I didn't work here. You 
		deliberately...

				MITCH
		Right. I recognized you when I came 
		in. I thought you might like to know 
		what it felt like to be on the other 
		end of a gag. What do you think of 
		that, Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		I think you're a louse.

				MITCH
		I am.
			(he tips his hat)
		Good day.
			(to Mrs. MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(and he goes down the 
			steps)

				MELANIE
		And I'm glad you didn't get your 
		lovebirds!

				MITCH
			(breezily, as he goes 
			out)
		I'll find something else.
			(he gives a slight 
			bow)
		See you in court some day.

	The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		That... that... who was that?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I have no idea.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She 
	looks through the glass.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	getting into his car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking after the car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She 
	begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.

	as she comes up to the counter.

				MELANIE
		Have you got a pencil?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What? Oh, yes, certainly.

	As Melanie begins writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		They said the myna bird would be 
		here later this afternoon. If you'd 
		care to come back...

				MELANIE
		No, you'd better send him. May I use 
		your phone?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(bewildered by 
			everything)
		Yes, certainly.
			(she puts phone on 
			counter)

				MELANIE
			(as she dials)
		Do you have any lovebirds?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		No, not in the shop. But I can order 
		them for you.

				MELANIE
		How soon?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well... well, how soon would you 
		want them?

				MELANIE
		Immediately.
			(into phone)
		Is this the Daily News? Melanie 
		Daniels. Would you get me the city 
		desk, please?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I might be able to have them by 
		tomorrow morning. Would that be all 
		right?

				MELANIE
			(with an edged anger)
		That would be just fine.
			(into phone)
		Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I 
		want you to do a favor for me.
			(pause)
		No, this is a small one.
			(pause)
		Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, 
		would I try to pressure you?  Will 
		you call the Department of Motor 
		Vehicles for me and find out who 
		owns this license plate? DKQ dash 
		one seven six.
			(pause)
		Yes, a California plate.
			(pause)
		No, I'll stop up there in a little 
		while. Is daddy in his office?
			(pause)
		Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in 
		on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see 
		him later. Thank you, Charlie.
			(she hangs up)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.

				MELANIE
		Now. What time tomorrow morning?

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR

	pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She 
	glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around 
	to the other side, and opens the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses 
	in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND

	running down the list of names slowly. It stops.

	INSERT - THE CARD

	her finger beside it.

	BRENNER, M. 3B

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she 
	runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then 
	does the same for the next column.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, 
	grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

	REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE

	coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly 
	toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, 
	waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
	answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the 
	elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The 
	elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows 
	her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The 
	elevator doors close.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR

	The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
	Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
	down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-
	consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. 
	The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The 
	doors begin to open.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is 
	right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The 
	man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in 
	front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn 
	the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment 
	just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. 
	He looks at Melanie.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling at him feebly.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm 
	of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie 
	watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down 
	before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND

	reaching into the purse for a white envelope.

	INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE

	written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly 
	goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Miss...?  She stops, distressed.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other 
	end, near the elevator.

				MAN
		Is that for Mitch Brenner?

				MELANIE
			(curtly)
		Yes.

				MAN
		He's not home.

				MELANIE
		That's all right.

	She presses button for the elevator.

				MAN
		He won't be back until Monday. I 
		mean, if those birds are for him....

				MELANIE
		Monday?

				MAN
		Yes. I don't think you should leave 
		them in the hall, do you?

				MELANIE
			(trapped)
		Well, I...

	The elevator doors open.

				MELANIE
		Well, where did he go?

				MAN
		Bodega Bay. He goes up there every 
		weekend.

				MELANIE
		Bodega Bay? Where's that?

				MAN
		Up on the coast. About sixty miles 
		north of here.

				MELANIE
		Sixty...
			(her face falls)
		Oh.

				MAN
		About an hour and a half on the 
		freeway. Or two if you take the coast 
		highway.

				MELANIE
		Oh.

				MAN
		I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm 
		going away myself. Someone's got to 
		feed them, I suppose.

				MELANIE
			(in utter despair now)
		Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

				MAN
			(apologetically)
		I'm awfully sorry.

	He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes 
	inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to 
	look at the birds.

	LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down 
	the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks 
	up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds 
	are COOING and CHIRPING madly.

				MELANIE
		Oh, shut up!

	And she steps into the elevator.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)

	on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
	with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
	should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
	ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
	birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
	SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns wheel forcefully.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one 
	side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car 
	rounds the curve.

	FULL SHOT - (MATTE)

	Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay.

	FULL SHOT - A CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS AT WATERFRONT

	ahead, through the windshield as the car approaches.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind the wheel, leaning forward slightly for a look at the 
	town.

	LONG SHOT - DOCKS ON LEFT

	through the windshield as Melanie slows her speed.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - STORES

	on right of the road as Melanie enters the town. SLOW PAN 
	matching car's cruise past BAKERY, SHOE REPAIR, CLEANERS, 
	RADIO AND TELEVISION.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - THE TIDES

	past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the 
	docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)

	studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN

	through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life 
	in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with 
	their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.  
	This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- 
	is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's

	P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO 
	BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the 
	door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling 
	suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks 
	quickly toward the front door.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	enters post office.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

	behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out 
	a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not 
	look up as she approaches.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars of the cage.

				MELANIE
		Good morning.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

				CLERK
			(without looking up)
		Morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could help me.

				CLERK
		Try my best.

				MELANIE
		I'm looking for a man named Mitchell 
		Brenner.

				CLERK
		Yep.

	He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		Do you know him?

				CLERK
		Yep.

				MELANIE
		Where does he live?

				CLERK
		Right here. Bodega Bay.

				MELANIE
		Yes, but where?

				CLERK
		Right across the bay there.

				MELANIE
		Where?

	It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he 
	leaves the window.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars, exasperated.

	REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE

	as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's 
	vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the 
	Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches 
	him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if 
	he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock 
	still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then 
	that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither 
	speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at 
	her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends 
	his arm and points.

				CLERK
		See where I'm pointing?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

				CLERK (O.S.)
		See them two big trees across there?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes?

				CLERK (O.S.)
		And the white house?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		That's where the Brenners live.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

				CLERK
		Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

				MELANIE
		The two kids?

				CLERK
		Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

				MELANIE
		I see. How do I get down there?

				CLERK
		Follow the road straight through 
		town 'til it curves off on the left.  
		That'll take you right around the 
		bay to their front door.

				MELANIE
		The front door.
			(pause)
		Isn't there a back road I can take?

				CLERK
		Nope. That's the road. Straight 
		through town, stay on your left, 
		right around the bay to the front 
		door.

				MELANIE
		You see, I wanted to surprise them.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		I didn't want to come right down the 
		road, where they could see me.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		It's a surprise, you see.

				CLERK
		Mmmmmm.
			(long pause)
		'Course, you could get yourself a 
		boat, cut right across the bay with 
		it. The Brenners got a little dock 
		there you could tie up at. If that's 
		what you wanted to do.

				MELANIE
		Where would I get a boat?

				CLERK
		Down at the dock by the Tides 
		Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard 
		boat?

				MELANIE
			(looking at him)
		Of course.

				CLERK
			(looks back at her)
		D'you want me to order one for you?

				MELANIE
			(surprised)
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		What name?

				MELANIE
		Daniels.

				CLERK
		Okay.

	He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the 
	bay.

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for 
	the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up 
	and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns 
	back toward the post office.

	INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, 
	still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could tell me...

				CLERK
		Yep?

				MELANIE
		The little girl's name.

				CLERK
		The little Brenner girl?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				CLERK
		Alice, I think.
			(he turns, shouts to 
			someone in rear)
		Harry, what's the little Brenner 
		girl's name?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		What?

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		The little Brenner girl.

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Lois!

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		It's Alice, ain't it?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		No, it's Lois!

				CLERK
			(to Melanie)
		It's Alice.

				MELANIE
		Are you sure?

				CLERK
		Well, I ain't positive, if that's 
		what you mean.

				MELANIE
		I need her exact name, you see.

				CLERK
		That case, I tell you what you do.  
		You go straight through town 'til 
		you see a little hotel on your left 
		there. Not the motel, that's the 
		other end of town. This is the hotel. 
		Now you take a right turn there, you 
		got that?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

				CLERK
		Near the top of the hill, you'll see 
		the school and right behind it, the 
		church. You head for the school.  
		Now just past the school, you'll see 
		a little house with a red mail box.  
		That's where Annie Hayworth lives, 
		she's the school teacher. You ask 
		her about the little Brenner girl.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		Yep.
			(pause)
		Could save yourself a lot of trouble. 
		Her name's Alice for sure.

				MELANIE
		Can I have the boat in about twenty 
		minutes?

	The Clerk nods.

				MELANIE
		How much for the phone calls?

				CLERK
			(brushing this aside)
		It's nothing.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	grinning, as she makes for the door and EXITS.

	EXT. GENERAL STORE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	LONG SHOT (MATTE) - MELANIE'S CAR turning in school road.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR

	passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX

	with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.  
	The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the 
	front door. There are white curtains in every window of the 
	house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway 
	advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting. She RINGS the bell again:

				ANNIE'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Yes? Who is it?

				MELANIE
		Me!

				ANNIE'S VOICE
		Who's me?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of 
	the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for 
	flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the 
	house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
	two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
	hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the 
	garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
	stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling 
	of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.

				MELANIE
		Miss Hayworth?

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to 
		bother you, but...

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and 
	groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She 
	studies her openly.

				ANNIE
		Yes?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		The man at the post office sent me.  
		He said you'd know the name of the 
		little Brenner girl.

				ANNIE
		Cathy?

				MELANIE
		The one who lives in the white house 
		across the bay?

				ANNIE
		That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		They seemed sure it was either Alice 
		or Lois.

				ANNIE
		Which is why the mail in this town 
		never gets delivered to the right 
		place.
			(She takes out package 
			of cigarettes, offers 
			one to Melanie)
		Did you want to see Cathy about 
		something?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	taking cigarette, hesitating.

				MELANIE
		Well... not exactly.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	studying her, thinking she understands.

				ANNIE
		Are you a friend of Mitch's?

				MELANIE
		No, not really.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She 
	puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.

				ANNIE
		I've been wanting a cigarette for 
		the past twenty minutes, but I 
		couldn't convince myself to stop.  
		This 'tilling of the soil' can get a 
		little compulsive, you know.

				MELANIE
		It's a lovely garden.

				ANNIE
		Thank you. It gives me something to 
		do with my spare time.
			(pause)
		There's a lot of spare time in Bodega 
		Bay.
			(another pause)
		Did you plan on staying long?

				MELANIE
		No. Just a few hours.

				ANNIE
		You're leaving after you see Cathy?

				MELANIE
		Well... something like that.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so 
		mysterious.

				ANNIE
		Actually, it's none of my business.

	There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it 
	is none of Annie's business.

				ANNIE
			(putting out cigarette)
		I'd better get on my way. Thank you 
		very much.

				ANNIE
		Not at all.

	They begin walking toward the car.

				ANNIE
			(still curious)
		Did you drive up from San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		It's a nice drive.
			(pause)
		Is that where you met Mitch?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating, then)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		I guess that's where everyone meets 
		him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost 
	on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her 
	face.

				MELANIE
		Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss 
		Hayworth.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie leans over the seat.

				ANNIE
		Do I?
			(she shakes her head, 
			smiles wistfully)
		No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
			(pause)
		Or maybe a closed one.
			(she smiles again, 
			sees the lovebirds)
		Pretty. What are they?

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds.

	Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship 
	with Mitch:

				ANNIE
		Mmm.
			(pause)
		Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

	She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	watching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face.

	HIGH SHOT

	She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the 
	bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman. 
	She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to 
	the dock and the waiting boat.  She gets into the outboard 
	motorboat, the fisherman helping her. He hands down the 
	lovebirds in their cage.

	FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

	coming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She

	except for the cry of the gulls.

	LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a 
	little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and 
	a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the 
	engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the 
	truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch 
	Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this 
	distance -- and he comes over to the truck.

	The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and 
	heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust 
	behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking 
	after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up 
	toward the barn in the distance.

	opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door 
	for her, and they ENTER.

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of 
	a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, 
	and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
	ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
	sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall 
	of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the 
	bay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
	bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
	movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
	CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates 
	his attention between serving his customers and watching the 
	Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

	MED. SHOT - THE BAR

	Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.

				MITCH
		Deke, have you got a first aid kit 
		back there?

				DEKE
			(instantly alarmed)
		What happened?

				MITCH
		Young woman cut herself.

				DEKE
		Shall I call the doctor?

				MITCH
			(accepting the first 
			aid kit)
		I don't think it's that serious.  
		You want to sit up here?

	Melanie climbs onto the stool.

				DEKE
		You cut yourself outside, Miss?

				MITCH
		Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a 
		boat.

	He is rummaging around in the kit.

				DEKE
		I had a man trip and fall in the 
		parking lot once, sued me before I 
		could bat an eyelash.

				MITCH
		I don't think Miss Daniels is going 
		to sue anybody.

				DEKE
			(doubtfully)
		Well, you're the lawyer.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.

				MELANIE
		What's that?

				MITCH
		Just some peroxide. I want to clean 
		out the cut.

	He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the 
	cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

				MELANIE
		So you're a lawyer.

				MITCH
		That's right. What are you doing in 
		Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		Do you practice here?

				MITCH
		No, San Francisco. What are you...?

				MELANIE
		What kind of law?

				MITCH
		Criminal.

				MELANIE
		Is that why you'd like to see everyone 
		behind bars?

				MITCH
		Not everyone, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Only violators and practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		That's right.

	As he swabs cut.

				MELANIE
		Ouch!

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		What are you doing up here?

				MELANIE
		Didn't you see the lovebirds?

				MITCH
		You came all the way up here to bring 
		me those birds?

				MELANIE
		To bring your sister those birds.  
		You said it was her birthday.  
		Besides, I was coming up anyway.

				MITCH
		What for?

				MELANIE
		To see a friend of mine.
			(she winces)
		Will you please be careful?

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		Who's your friend?

				MELANIE
		Why...
			(pause, stymied)

				MITCH
		Yes?

				MELANIE
			(blurting the only 
			name she knows)
		Annie. Annie Hayworth.

				MITCH
		Well, well, small world. Annie 
		Hayworth.

				MELANIE
			(realizing this was a 
			mistake)
		Yes.

				MITCH
		How do you know Annie?

				MELANIE
			(the lie getting deeper)
		We... we went to school together.  
		College.

				MITCH
		Did you! Imagine that! How long will 
		you be staying?

				MELANIE
		Just a few... just a day or two... 
		the weekend.

				MITCH
		I think we'll have to shave the hair. 
		Deke, have you got a razor?

				MELANIE
			(pulling away)
		Oh, no you don't!

				MITCH
		It's still bleeding a little. Here, 
		let me put this on.

	He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

				MITCH
		Bend your head down. This little 
		Band-Aid won't show.

	He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a 
	mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at 
	it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

				MITCH
		So you came up to see Annie, huh?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		I don't believe you.
			(grins)
		I think you came up to see me.

				MELANIE
		Why would I want to see you, of all 
		people?

				MITCH
			(shrugging)
		I don't know. But it seems to me you 
		must have gone to a lot of trouble 
		to find out who I was, and where I 
		lived and...

				MELANIE
		It was no trouble at all. I simply 
		called my father's paper. Besides, I 
		was coming up here anyway, I already 
		told you...

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		You like me, huh?

				MELANIE
		I loathe you. You have no manners.  
		And you're arrogant and conceited 
		and... I wrote you a letter about 
		it, in fact, but I tore it up.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		None of your business.
			(pause)
		Am I still bleeding?

	She lowers her head.

				MITCH
		Can't see a thing.

				MELANIE
		I can't say I like your seagulls 
		much, either. I come all the way up 
		here to...

				MITCH
		But you were coming up anyway, 
		remember?

				MELANIE
		I was! And all I get for my pains is 
		a... a... a hole in the head!

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		Right next to the one you already 
		had.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		Look, Mr. Brenner...

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	They turn toward the door.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER

	closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a 
	woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, 
	cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking 
	about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city 
	dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

				LYDIA
			(puzzled)
		I thought I saw your car. What are 
		you doing in town?

				MITCH
			(rising to greet her)
		I had to acknowledge a delivery.
			(grins)
		Mother, I'd like you to meet...

				LYDIA
		A what?

				MITCH
			(continuing)
		Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, 
	but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the 
	introduction.

				LYDIA
		How do you do, Miss Daniels?
			(to Mitch)
		Acknowledge a what?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MITCH
		A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels 
		brought some birds from San Francisco.

	Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San 
	Francisco chippies.

				LYDIA
		Oh. I see.

				MITCH
		For Cathy. For her birthday. By the 
		way, where is she?

				LYDIA
		Across at Brinkmeyer's.

				MITCH
		Miss Daniels is staying for the 
		weekend. In fact, I've already invited 
		her to dinner tonight.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		After all, you did go to the trouble 
		of bringing up those birds.

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

	BACK TO SCENE

				LYDIA
		You did say birds?

				MITCH
		Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

				LYDIA
			(understanding 
			completely now)
		Lovebirds, I see.

				MITCH
		...get away without thanking you in 
		some small way. After all, you haven't 
		even met Cathy and you are staying 
		for the weekend...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		You are, aren't you?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, but...

				MITCH
		Then it's settled. What time is 
		dinner, Mother?

				LYDIA
		Seven o'clock, same as usual.

				MITCH
		I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.  
		Where are you staying?

				MELANIE
		With... with Annie, of course.

				MITCH
		Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter 
		to seven, will that be all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie... Annie may have made other 
		plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I 
		can find my own way.

				MITCH
		You're sure now? You won't hire a 
		boat or anything?

				MELANIE
		I'm sure.

				MITCH
		Seven o'clock then.

				MELANIE
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	grinning.

				MITCH
		We'll be waiting. How's your head 
		now?

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

	Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.

				MELANIE
			(with an overwarm 
			smile)
		It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull 
		hit me, that's all.

	Lydia stares at her doubtfully.

	EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT

	Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her 
	hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still 
	in the window. The door suddenly opens.

				ANNIE
			(surprised)
		Oh, hi!
			(pause)
		Did you find her all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		Yes, I did.

	There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at 
	Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.

				MELANIE
		I was wondering...

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		That sign.
			(pause)
		Do you think I could have the room 
		for a single night?

				ANNIE
		Well, I'd really hope to rent it 
		for...

				MELANIE
		I would appreciate it. I've tried 
		everywhere in town, and they're all 
		full.

				ANNIE
			(after a pause)
		Sure. You can have it.
			(smiles)
		Where's your bag? In the car?

	Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then 
	smiles.

				ANNIE
		It's utilitarian, I'll say that for 
		it.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I just picked up some things for the 
		night at the general store. You see, 
		I hadn't planned on spending much 
		time here.

				ANNIE
		Yes, I know. Did something unexpected 
		crop up?

	There is a moment where both women look at each other...  
	When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she 
	is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(pause)
		May I use your phone? I'd like to 
		call home.

	There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's 
	attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.

				ANNIE
		Why don't you come in then?  I was 
		just about to mix a martini.

	She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both 
	hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.

	LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS

	flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

				ANNIE
			(shaking her head)
		Don't they ever stop migrating?

	But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously 
	serious expression.

							  DISSOLVE

	LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's 
	car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained 
	with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the 
	silence.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	as it pulls into the Brenner yard.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine 
	her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.  
	She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.  
	She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no 
	answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In 
	the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from 
	behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.

				MELANIE
			(calling)
		Hi!

	FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA

	in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.

				CATHY
			(excitedly)
		Hi!
			(she breaks into a 
			trot toward Melanie)

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
	old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt 
	and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates 
	for just a moment.

				CATHY
		Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking 
	her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.

				CATHY
		They're beautiful! They're just what 
		I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? 
		I can't tell which is which.

				MELANIE
		Well, I suppose...

	FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM

				MITCH
			(coming up)
		Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm 
		glad you came. Are you hungry?

				MELANIE
		Famished.

				MITCH
		Dinner's just about ready.
			(explaining)
		We were out back looking at the 
		chickens. Something seems to be wrong 
		with them.

				LYDIA
			(going toward house)
		There's nothing wrong with those 
		chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call 
		Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

				MITCH
			(as they follow into 
			house)
		I don't know what good that'll do.
			(aside to Melanie)
		Chickens won't eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining 
	room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along.

				LYDIA
		He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

				MITCH
		Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer 
		beware.

				LYDIA
		Whose side are you on?

				MITCH
		I'm simply quoting the law.

				LYDIA
		Never mind the law. Cathy, you can 
		start serving the soup.

	She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone 
	RINGS.

				LYDIA
		This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.  
		I didn't interrupt your dinner, did 
		I?
			(pause)
		Fred, that feed you sold me is no 
		good.
			(pause)
		The chicken feed. The three bags I 
		brought.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	holding the telephone.

				LYDIA
		Well, it's just no good. The chickens 
		won't eat it.
			(pause)
		They're always hungry, Fred. I opened 
		one of the sacks when I got home, 
		and I poured it out for them, and 
		they wouldn't touch it. Now you know 
		chickens as well as I do, and when 
		they won't eat, there's just something 
		wrong with what they're being fed, 
		that's all.
			(pause)
		No, they're not fussy chickens.
			(pause)
		Who? What's he got to do with it?
			(pause)
		Fred, I don't care how much feed you 
		sold him. My chickens...
			(pause)
		He did? Dan Fawcett?
			(pause)
		This afternoon?
			(pause)
		Well, that only proves what I'm 
		saying. The feed you sold us is...
			(pause)
		Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Uh-
		huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see 
		him. You don't think there's something 
		going around, do you?
			(pause)
		No, never.
			(pause)
		No, Fred, they don't seem sick at 
		all. They just won't eat.
			(pause)
		Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get 
		over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll... 
		mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred,

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Lydia comes to the table. Mitch and Melanie are sitting 
	opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving 
	the last bowl of soup.

				LYDIA
			(as she sits)
		He got a call from Dan Fawcett a 
		little while ago. His chickens won't 
		eat, either.

				CATHY
		It's what you said, Mom. Mr.  
		Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

				LYDIA
			(slowly)
		No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a 
		different brand.
			(extremely worried)
		You don't think they're getting sick, 
		do you, Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her eyes troubled as she picks up her napkin.

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have 
	been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are 
	carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.  
	Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is 
	playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from 
	the ashtray now and again to take a puff.

				CATHY
		I still don't understand how you 
		knew I wanted lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Your brother told me.

				LYDIA
			(as she goes into 
			kitchen)
		Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, 
		is that right?

				MELANIE
		No, not exactly.

				CATHY
		Mitch knows lots of people in San 
		Francisco. Of course, they're mostly 
		hoods.

				LYDIA
			(from the kitchen)
		Cathy!

				CATHY
		Well, Mom, he's the first to admit 
		it.
			(to Melanie)
		He spends half his day in the 
		detention cells at the Hall of 
		Justice.

				LYDIA
			(coming from kitchen)
		In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is 
		entitled to a fair trial. Your 
		brother's practice...

				CATHY
		Mom, please, I know all the democracy 
		jazz. They're still hoods.
			(to Melanie)
		He's got a client now who shot his 
		wife in the head six times. Six times, 
		can you imagine it?
			(she starts for living 
			room)
		I mean, even twice would be overdoing 
		it, don't you think?

				MELANIE
			(to Mitch as he carries 
			load of dishes out)
		Why did he shoot her?

				MITCH
		He was watching a ball game on 
		television.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
		His wife changed the channel.

	He GOES INTO kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her 
	cigarette.

				CATHY
		Is smoking fun?

				MELANIE
		Oh, I suppose so.

				CATHY
		Could I have a puff?

				MELANIE
		I don't think your mother would like 
		that.

				CATHY (O.S.)
		Just a little one.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.  
	Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes 
	a small puff.

				CATHY
			(delighted)
		Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
			(determined)
		When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like 
		a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, 
		you know.

				MELANIE
		I know.

				CATHY
		Are you coming to my party?

				MELANIE
		I don't think so.
			(seeing the child's 
			face)
		I have to get back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Don't you like us?

				MELANIE
			(touching her hair)
		Darling, of course I do!

				CATHY
		Don't you like Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		I don't know yet.

				CATHY
		Mitch likes it very much. He comes 
		up every weekend, you know, even 
		though he has his own apartment in 
		the city. He says San Francisco is 
		just an ant hill at the foot of a 
		bridge.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I guess it does get a little hectic 
		at times.

				CATHY
		If you do decide to come, don't say 
		I told you about it. It's supposed 
		to be a surprise party.

	Melanie laughs.

				CATHY
		You see, they've got this whole 
		complicated thing figured out where 
		I'm going over to Michele's for the 
		afternoon, and Michele's mother is 
		going to say she has a headache and 
		would I mind very much if she took 
		me home. Then, when we get back here, 
		all of the kids'll jump out!
			(pause)
		Won't you come? Won't you please 
		come?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.

				MELANIE
		I don't think so, Cathy.

	INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.

				LYDIA
		She's a charming girl, isn't she, 
		Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yes, very.

				LYDIA
		And certainly pretty.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		How long have you known her?

				MITCH
		I told you. We met yesterday.

				LYDIA
		In a bird shop.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		She was selling birds.

				MITCH
		No. I only led her into believing I 
		believed she was... Mother, it's 
		really very complicated.

				LYDIA
		But she did buy the lovebirds and 
		then brought them all the way...

				MITCH
		Mother, where did you go to law 
		school?

				LYDIA
			(laughing)
		Forgive me. I suppose I'm just 
		naturally curious about a girl like 
		that.
			(pause)
		She's very rich, isn't she?

				MITCH
		I suppose so. Her father owns a big 
		newspaper in San Francisco.

				LYDIA
		You'd think he could manage to keep 
		her name out of print. She's always 
		mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		She is the one who jumped into that 
		fountain in Rome last summer, isn't 
		she?

				MITCH
		Yes, Mother.

				LYDIA
		Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
			(pause)
		I know it was supposed to be very 
		warm there, Mitch, but... well...  
		actually... well, the newspaper said 
		she was naked.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		It's none of my business, of course, 
		but when you bring a girl like that 
		to...

				MITCH
		Mother?

				LYDIA
			(looking up)
		Yes?

				MITCH
		I think I can handle Melanie Daniels 
		by myself.

				LYDIA
		Well...

				MELANIE
		Oh, yes.

				MELANIE
		Will I be seeing you again?

				MITCH

				MELANIE
		Oh. That. Rome.

				MITCH
		Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get 
		along very...

				MELANIE
		In case you're interested, I was 
		pushed into that fountain.

				MELANIE
		Without any clothes on?

				MELANIE
		With all my clothes on!  The newspaper 
		that ran the story happens to be a 
		rival of my father's paper.  Anything 
		they said...

				MITCH
		You were just a poor, innocent victim 
		of circumstance, huh?

				MELANIE
		I'm neither poor nor innocent, but 
		the truth of that particular...

				MITCH
		The truth is you were running around 
		with a pretty wild crowd...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		...who didn't much care for propriety 
		or convention or...

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		...the opinions of others, and you 
		went right along with them, isn't 
		that the truth?

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's the truth. But I was 
		pushed into that fountain, and that's 
		the truth, too.

				MITCH
		Sure. Do you really know Annie 
		Hayworth?

				MELANIE
		No.
			(pause)
		At least, I didn't until I came up 
		here.

				MITCH
		So you didn't go to school together.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		And you didn't come up here to see 
		her.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		You were lying.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I was lying.

				MITCH
		Did you really write a letter to me?  
		Or was that a lie, too?

				MELANIE
		I wrote the letter.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think 
		you need those lovebirds, after all.  
		They may help your personality." 
		That's what it said.

				MITCH
		But you tore it up.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		Why?

				MELANIE
		Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

				MITCH
		Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

				MELANIE
		I told you what happened in Rome!

				MITCH
		Do you expect me to believe...?

				MELANIE
		I don't give a damn what you believe!

	DOOR OPENING.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels? Is that you?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes.

	Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:

				ANNIE
		Hi.
			(seeing her face)
		Is something wrong? Is that cut 
		beginning to bother you?

				MELANIE
			(touching her head)
		No, it's not the cut that's bothering 
		me.

				ANNIE
			(concerned)
		Would you like some brandy?

				MELANIE
		If you have some, I'd...

				ANNIE
		I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.  
		Do you want a sweater or something?  
		A quilt?

	As Annie gets the brandy:

				MELANIE
		No, thank you.
			(pause)
		Won't you call me Melanie?

				ANNIE
		All right.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. 
	She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact,

		Thank you.

		It gets a little chilly here at night

			(nodding)
		How do you like our little hamlet?

				MELANIE
		I despise it.

			(laughing)
		Well, I don't suppose it offers much

		Where are you from originally, Annie?

				ANNIE
		Oh, someone invited me up for the

		Look, I see no reason for being coy

				ANNIE
		I guess you knew that, anyway.

				MELANIE
		I suspected as much.

				ANNIE
		You needn't worry. It's over and 
		done with. A long time ago.

				MELANIE
		Annie -- there's nothing between 
		Mitch and me.

				ANNIE
		Isn't there?
			(she shrugs)
		Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's 
		never anything between Mitch and any 
		girl.

				MELANIE
		What do you mean?

				ANNIE
		I think I'll have some of that, too.
			(she pours brandy, 
			drinks, sighs)
		I was seeing quite a lot of him in 
		San Francisco, you know.
			(she smiles weakly)
		And then, one weekend, he asked me 
		up to meet Lydia.

				MELANIE
		When was this?

				ANNIE
		Four years ago. Of course, that was 
		shortly after his father died.  Things 
		may be different now.

				MELANIE
		Different?

				ANNIE
		With Lydia.
			(pause)
		Did she seem a trifle distant?

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		A trifle.

				ANNIE
		Then maybe it isn't different at 
		all. You know, her attitude nearly 
		drove me crazy. I simply couldn't 
		understand it.

				ANNIE
		When I got back to San Francisco I 
		spent days trying to figure out just 
		what I'd done to displease her.

				MELANIE
		And what had you done?

				ANNIE
		Nothing! I simply existed. So what 
		was the answer? A jealous woman, 
		right? A clinging possessive mother.
			(she shakes her head)
		Wrong. With all due respect to 
		Oedipus, I don't think that was the 
		case at all.

				MELANIE
		Then what was it?

				ANNIE
		Lydia liked me, you see. That was 
		the strange part of it. In fact, now 
		that I'm no longer a threat, we're 
		very good friends.

				MELANIE
		Then why did she object to you?

				ANNIE
		Because she was afraid.

				MELANIE
		Afraid you'd take Mitch?

				ANNIE
		Afraid I'd give Mitch.

				MELANIE
		I don't understand.

				ANNIE
		Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch 
		the only thing Lydia can give him --
		love.

				MELANIE
		Annie, that adds up to a jealous, 
		possessive woman.

				ANNIE
		No, I don't think so. She's not afraid 
		of losing her son, you see.  She's 
		only afraid of being abandoned.

				MELANIE
		Someone ought to tell her she'd be 
		gaining a daughter.

				ANNIE
		She already has a daughter.

				MELANIE
		What about Mitch? Didn't he have 
		anything to say about this?

				ANNIE
			(apologetically)
		I can understand his position. He 
		went through a lot with Lydia after 
		his father died. He didn't want to 
		risk going through it all over again.

				MELANIE
		I see.

				ANNIE
		So it ended. Not immediately, of 
		course. I went back to San Francisco, 
		and I still saw Mitch every now and 
		then... but we both knew it was 
		finished.

				MELANIE
		Then what are you doing here in Bodega 
		Bay?

				ANNIE
		You get straight to the point, don't 
		you?

				MELANIE
		I'm sorry. Forgive me.

				ANNIE
		No, that's all right, I don't mind.  
		I came up here for two reasons. To 
		begin with, I was bored with my job 
		in San Francisco. I was teaching at 
		a private school there... well, you 
		know, you probably went to one 
		yourself.

				MELANIE
		I did.

				ANNIE
		Then you know. Little girls in brown 
		beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
		I'll go into that classroom on Monday 
		morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
		five upturned little faces, and each 
		of them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
		give me what you have.'
			(pause)
		And I'll give them what I have. I 
		haven't got very much, but I'll give 
		them every ounce of it. To me, that's 
		very important. It makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time.
			(she sighs)
		That's the first reason.

				MELANIE
		And the second?

				ANNIE
			(simply)
		I wanted to be near Mitch.
			(pause)
		It was over, and I knew it, but I 
		wanted to be near him, anyway.
			(she smiles)
		You see, I still like him a hell of 
		a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
		want to lose his friendship... ever.

	There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE 
	shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer 
	it.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	at the phone.

				ANNIE
		Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't 
		asleep. What is it?
			(pause)
		Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, 
		hold on.
			(she turns to Melanie)
		It's Mitch. For you.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie 
	hesitating.

				ANNIE
		He's waiting.

	Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie 
	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
	talks to Mitch in the background.

	Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

				MELANIE
			(at phone; coolly)
		Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, 
		thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I 
		simply followed the road. It's a 
		very bright night.
			(pause)
		What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to 
		apologize. I can understand...
			(pause; she listens)
		Well...
			(she listens again)
		That's very kind of you. No, I'm not 
		angry.
			(she listens)
		I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get 
		back to San Francisco.
			(pause)
		No, I wouldn't want to disappoint 
		Cathy, but...
			(pause)
		I see.
			(she is warming)
		I see. Well, if you really...
			(pause)
		All right. Yes, I'll be there.
			(pause)
		Good night, Mitch.

	She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.

				MELANIE
		He wants me to go to Cathy's party 
		tomorrow afternoon.
			(pause)
		I said I would.

				ANNIE
		I'll be going, too, to help out. It 
		should be fun, Melanie.

				MELANIE
		It seems so pointless.
			(she sighs)
		I think I'll go to sleep. This has 
		been a busy day.
			(picking up her paper 
			bag)
		My luggage.

	She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

				ANNIE
		Pretty. Did you get that at 
		Brinkmeyer's?

	Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent 
	for a moment, pensive. Then:

				MELANIE
		Do you think I should go?

				ANNIE
		That's up to you.

				MELANIE
		It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

				ANNIE
		Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

				MELANIE
			(firmly)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		Then go.

	The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

				MELANIE
		Thank you, Annie.

	Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, 
	startling them both.

				ANNIE
			(rising)
		Who can that be at this hour?
			(she walks to door)
		Who is it?
			(no answer)
		Is someone there?

	Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks 
	the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  
	There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

				ANNIE
			(to the emptiness 
			outside)
		Is anyone there?

				MELANIE
			(pointing to the ground)
		Look.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
			(sympathetically)
		Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably 
		lost his way in the dark.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.  
	And then, slowly:

				MELANIE
		But... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's 
		a full moon.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and 
	consternation:

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with 
	balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. 
	The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are 
	clustered around a long folding table upon which are 
	sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
	helping the children to more or telling them they are having 
	too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
	LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
	are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
	away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
	bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
	entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
	The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, 
	the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the 
	CAMERA out to the left.

	CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES

	Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and 
	stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one 
	of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one 
	of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

				MELANIE
		I really shouldn't have any more.  
		I'm a little tipsy already.

				MITCH
		I'm trying to get you to stay for 
		dinner. We're going to have a lot of 
		roast left over.

				MELANIE
		I couldn't possibly. I have to get 
		back.

				MITCH
			(with a shrug)
		Cheers.

				MELANIE
		Cheers.

	They drink.

				MELANIE
		What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?

				MITCH
		Why do you have to rush off? What's 
		so important in San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Well... I have to get to work tomorrow 
		morning, for one thing.

				MITCH
			(surprised)
		You have a job?

				MELANIE
			(sipping at the martini)
		I have several jobs.

				MITCH
		What do you do?

				MELANIE
		I do different things on different 
		days.

				MITCH
		Like what?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating)
		On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work 
		for the Travelers' Aid. At the 
		airport.

				MITCH
		Helping travelers.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

	She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really 
	considered before what she does with her time, and now that 
	she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant.

				MELANIE
		And on Tuesdays, I take a course in 
		General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's 
		not a job, of course. I just take it 
		because...

				MITCH
		What about Thursdays and Fridays?

				MELANIE
		On Thursdays I have my meeting and 
		lunch.
			(pause)
		I'm chairman of a group that's sending 
		a little Korean boy through school.  
		We plan how to raise funds and... 
		things like that.
			(she shrugs)

				MITCH
		And Fridays? What do you do then?

				MELANIE
		Nothing.
			(she smiles)
		I go to bird shops on Fridays.

				MITCH
		I'm glad you do.

				MELANIE
		Do you know what I was doing in that 
		shop?

				MITCH
		What?

				MELANIE
		I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. 
		She's seventy years old, and veddy 
		prim and strait-laced.
			(she does an imitation)
		She's coming back from Europe at the 
		end of the month, and I'm going to 
		give her a myna bird that'll talk to 
		her.

				MITCH
		What'll it say?

				MELANIE
			(facetiously)
		You'll think me very bold, sir.

				MITCH
		No, tell me.

	She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
	LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
	Melanie's face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	serious, introspective.

				MELANIE
		That's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a 
		bird to shock my aunt. That's just 
		silly and childish.
			(slight pause)
		Maybe I ought to go join the other 
		children.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where 
	the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch 
	stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse 
	of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children 
	are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold 
	from Michele to Cathy.

	CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH

	The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We 
	see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by 
	way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
	OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
	children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
	this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching Mitch and Melanie.

	MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this 
	moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday 
	cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also 
	catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat 
	as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. 
	During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy 
	off.

				ANNIE
		All right then, here we go.
			(she spins her)
		Once!
			(she spins her again)
		Twice!
			(she spins her again)
		Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!

	She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as 
	though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  
	Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:

				LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
		Look! Look!

	Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as 
	she looks up.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	A gull is swooping down.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously 
	reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly 
	swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.

				CATHY
		No touching allowed!

	She almost falls.

	FULL SHOT - THE GULL

	seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then 
	returns.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as 
	she ducks with two gulls swooping by.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round 
	to the front of it.

	FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	Annie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children 
	are running in the background.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	reacting to two more gulls diving.

	FULL SHOT - TWO GULLS - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	diving toward the children.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY

	She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks.

	TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS

	as a gull swoops between them.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	coming out of the house with a broom.

	TWO GULLS

	swooping down at the children's heads.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	swinging at gull and missing.

	LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	running toward bank. Gull swooping after him.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into 
	him.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank.

	THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY

	They look up.

	LONG SHOT - THE GULLS

	against the sky, flying away in formation.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no 
	longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to 
	Melanie.

				MITCH
		Are you all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
			(coming over)
		That's the darnest thing thing I've 
		ever seen in my life.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				LYDIA
		Are they gone?

				MITCH
		They're gone, Mother.

	FULL SHOT - THE LAWN

	as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the 
	cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck 
	very close by without having injured anyone. All that 
	adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

				LYDIA
		Well... well, is everyone all right?

				MITCH
			(with a small boy)
		I think he got a little scratch, 
		Mother.

				GIRL #3
		Did you see them? They were hawks!

				GIRL #4
		They were bigger than hawks!

				ANNIE
		Children, they were only seagulls.

	And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, 
	and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent 
	meaningful glance.

	BACK TO SCENE

				CATHY
		They must have been after the food, 
		Mother.

	They all turn toward the table.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE, 
	UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	eyes narrowed.

				MITCH
		They didn't touch anything.

	BACK TO SCENE

				ANNIE
			(trying to restore 
			order)
		Well, they're gone now, so... so 
		let's...
			(pause)
		Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't 
		you, Cathy?

				GIRL #2
		Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.

				MITCH
		You look a little shaken.

				MELANIE
		I... I am.
			(pause)
		Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, 
		is it? The gull yesterday when I was 
		in the boat, and the one last night 
		at Annie's, and now...

				MITCH
		Last night? What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		A gull smashed into Annie's front 
		door.
			(pause)
		Mitch... what's happening?

				MITCH
			(concerned)
		I don't know, Melanie.
			(pause)
		Look, do you have to go back to 
		Annie's?

				MELANIE
		No, I have my things in the car.

				MITCH
			(gently)
		Then stay and have something to eat 
		before you start back. I'd feel a 
		lot better.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.

							  DISSOLVE

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND 

	He is slicing the leftover roast beef.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to 
	call into living room. The lovebirds in their cage are making 
	a terrible racket.

				MITCH
		Do you want some mustard with this?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		No, thank you.

				CATHY
			(coming from kitchen)
		Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

				MITCH
		She said something about having to 
		get home to take a call from her 
		mother back East.

				CATHY
		Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?

				MITCH
		Take it into the living room, would 
		you, hon?

				CATHY
			(seeing the birds)
		What's the matter with them?

	Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some 
	French bread.

				LYDIA
		What's the matter with all the birds?

	She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still 
	tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, 
	and then signs heavily.

				LYDIA
		Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm 
		sure Miss Daniels wants to get on 
		her way.

	As she moves into the living room.

				CATHY
		I think you ought to stay the night, 
		Melanie.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a sharp look at her daughter.

	MED. SHOT - CATHY

	pouring coffee into the cups set on coffee table.

				CATHY
		We've got an extra room upstairs and 
		everything.

				MITCH
			(coming in with two 
			plates)
		That road can be a bad one at night, 
		Melanie.
			(he picks up coffee 
			cup, hands it to 
			Melanie)

	They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet 
	style.

				MELANIE
		If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll 
		come onto the freeway much earlier.

				LYDIA
			(picking up a cup)
		Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, 
		isn't it, Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that 
		traffic going back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Did you put the cover on that cage, 
		Mom?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I did.

				CATHY
		Just listen to them!

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Some cream?

				MELANIE
		I'll get it.

	She reaches over for the cream pitcher. Her eye is caught by 
	something in the fireplace.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking curiously.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	a single swift is sitting on the hearth.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning to Mitch.

				MELANIE
		Mitch...

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	as dozens of swifts begin pouring from the opening.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened now.

				MELANIE
			(shouting it)
		Mitch!

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	hundreds of birds pouring into the room.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	shrieking in terror, dropping her coffee cup.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	full of birds, swooping, diving. Mitch runs to the door, 
	throws it open.

				MITCH
			(to the others)
		Get outside! Run!
			(he turns toward Lydia)

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA in terror, surrounded by birds.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Mother!

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching the cloth from the coffee table, cups, coffee pot, 
	sugar bowl, creamer falling to the floor as he swings the 
	cloth at the birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	covering her face.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	reaching for small fireplace broom.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	shrieking as the birds dive at her face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	realizing it's impossible to run. They must stay and fight.

				MITCH
			(shouting)
		Cathy, get some matches!

	MED. SHOT - CATHY

	running for the kitchen. Birds swooping after her.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the fireplace broom.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds 
	coming out of the opening. He stuffs paper under the logs 
	already in place there.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering 
	in her hair, caught there.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the broom, covered with birds.

	MED. SHOT - A PICTURE ON THE WALL

	(an enlargement of a photograph of Cathy, smiling.) As a 
	bird flutters against it.

	MED. SHOT - CATHY

	running into the room, covering her face with bent arm, 
	rushing to Mitch with the box of matches.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	taking the matches. He lights one. A bird hits his arm. He 
	drops the match. He lights another one.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE MATCH

	falling onto the paper in the fireplace. It flickers for a 
	moment, then catches. Birds are still pouring out, past the 
	paper beginning to catch.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE

	as a bird crashes through it.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head. She is 
	hysterics now, BABBLING. The SHRIEK of the birds is a wild 
	cacophony.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE

	blazing.

	MED. SHOT - A BIRD

	swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying

		Mitch! The curtains!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning, seeing, his eyes opening wide.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	ripping at the flaming curtain. He throws it to the floor, 
	begins stamping on it.

				CATHY
		It's working! The fire's working!

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she beats away another bird.

	CLOSE SHOT - ONE OF THE BROKEN WINDOWS

	the birds leaving en masse now.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	A shambles. Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures 
	askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass. In a 
	corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering 
	her face, sobbing. The burnt curtain is still smoldering.  
	Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom 
	wearily. The attack is over.

	INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND

	reaching down to pick up a dead bird.

	MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY

	a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out 
	speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the 
	palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.

				MALONE
		That's a chimney swift, all right.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		We know what it is, Al.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.

				MALONE
		Well, these birds live in chimneys, 
		you know.

				MITCH
		Not by the thousands.

				MALONE
		No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
			(pause)
		Did you have a light burning or 
		something.

				MITCH
		Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

				MALONE
		'Cause sometimes birds are attracted 
		by light, you know.
			(pause)
		Sure is a peculiar thing.

				MITCH
		What are we going to do about it, 
		Al?

				MALONE
		I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do 
		about what?

				MITCH
		Well...
			(he feels a little 
			foolish)
		Well... these birds attacked us.

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	slight disbelief on his face.

				MALONE
		What's more likely, they got in the 
		room and was just panicked, that's 
		all.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
			(still a little 
			hesitant)
		All right, I'll grant you a bird'll 
		panic in an enclosed room. But, they 
		didn't just get in. They came in! 
		Right down that chimney.

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
			(trying to make sense 
			of this)
		My wife found a bird in the back 
		seat of her car once.

				MALONE
			(shrugs)
		Didn't know how he got in there.  
		Had a broken leg, turned out. Just 
		fluttering all around there.
			(he shrugs again)

				MITCH
		These birds were...

				MALONE
		What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is 
		these things happen sometimes, you 
		know? Ain't much we can do about it.
			(he shrugs)

				LYDIA
		Tell him about the party.

				MITCH
		That's right. We had a party here 
		this afternoon for Cathy. Her 
		birthday.

				MALONE
		Oh, yeah, yeah.
			(he grins)
		How old is she now?

				MITCH
		Eleven. In the middle of the party, 
		some gulls came down at the children. 
		And Miss Daniels was attacked by a 
		gull just yesterday after...

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	considering this.

				MALONE
		Yeah.
			(thinking)
		Were the kids bothering them or 
		something? 'Cause sometimes they'll 
		do that, you know. If you make any 
		kind of disturbance near them, they'll 
		just come after you. I seen that 
		plenty of times myself.

	TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		The children were playing a game, 
		Al. Those gulls attacked without...

				MALONE
		Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty 
		strong word, don't you think? I mean, 
		birds just don't go around attacking 
		people without no reason, you know 
		what I mean? The kids just probably 
		scared them, that's all.

				LYDIA
		These birds attacked!

				MALONE
			(nodding)
		Well, what would you like me to do, 
		Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on 
		any suspicious birds in the area?
			(he smiles)
		Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't 
		it?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		Does this room look silly?

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
		No, you got quite a mess here, I'll 
		admit that.
			(pause)
		Maybe you oughta put some screening 
		on top of your chimney
			(pause)
		Seems a little pointless, though.  
		Freak accident like this wouldn't 
		happen again in a million years.
			(pause)
		You want some help cleaning up?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	exasperated.

				MITCH
		I can handle it myself.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	giving a small moan.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		I'll take Cathy up to bed.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		Are you staying?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		I think I should, don't you?

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	observing, making no comment.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders.

				MELANIE
		I'll get my things from the car. Do 
		you want to walk with me, Cathy?

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

	as Cathy and Melanie go out.

				MALONE
		Well, if there's anything else I can 
		do, Mitch...

				MITCH
		Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.

				MALONE
		Goodnight, Lydia.

	No answer.

				MALONE
		Sure is peculiar, I got to say that 
		for it.

	He exits.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still 
	as a stone in her chair. The door closes gently on a note of 
	utter helplessness.

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather 
	unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store.  Her 
	hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a 
	lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is 
	busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS 
	VOICES.

	 

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to 
		drop Cathy off now.

				MITCH'S VOICE
		Okay.

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		I'll probably drive over to the 
		Fawcett farm. Do you need anything 
		in town?

				MITCH'S VOICE
		No.

	Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window 
	and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck 
	starting.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck 
	and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the 
	road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA 
	FOLLOWING. She opens the door.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	There is no answer.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. 
	The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops 
	at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on 
	her face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds 
	TWEET at her.

				MELANIE
			(imitating them)
		Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is 
	an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.  
	She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then 
	peers out of the side window.

	LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin 
	column of smoke is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to 
	put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She 
	picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the 
	cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee 
	and then breathes deeply of the air.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE

	fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have 
	not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke 
	is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the 
	end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off 
	the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the 
	sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs 
	as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky 
	for a moment.

	SLOW PAN

	as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in 
	sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in 
	its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin 
	column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and 
	raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts 
	the rake down and begins walking toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch 
	coming toward her, her eyes glowing.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	closer to the house now.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting, anticipating.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR 
	CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the 
	garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS 
	again. She turns.

	Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing 
	a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wanted to change my shirt.

	Melanie is uncomprehending.

				MITCH
		It smelled of the fire.

				MELANIE
			(nodding)
		It's hard to believe anything at all 
		happened yesterday, isn't it? It's 
		so beautiful and still now.
			(pause; then sagely)
		I think I've got it all figured out, 
		by the way.

				MITCH
		Really? Tell me about it.

				MELANIE
			(secretively)
		It's an uprising.

				MITCH
		Of birds?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, of birds.

	Mitch grins.

				MELANIE
		It all started several months ago 
		with a peasant sparrow up in the 
		hills, a malcontent. He went around 
		telling all the other sparrows that 
		human beings weren't fit to rule 
		this planet, preaching wherever anyone 
		would listen...

				MITCH
		Growing a beard...

				MELANIE
			(delighted)
		Yes, of course, he had to have a 
		beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' 
		he kept saying, over and over...

				MITCH
		So they united.

				MELANIE
		Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows 
		out for kicks...

				MITCH
		Well, they'll go along with anything.

				MELANIE
		Sure. But eventually, even the more 
		serious-minded birds began to listen.  
		"Why should humans rule?" they asked
		 themselves.

				MITCH
		Hear!

				MELANIE
		Why should we submit ourselves to 
		their domination?

				MITCH
		Hear, hear!

				MELANIE
		And all the while, that sparrow was 
		getting in his little messages.  
		Birds of the world, unite!

				MITCH
		Take wing!

				MELANIE
		You have nothing to lose but your 
		feathers.

	They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then 
	laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly 
	still.

				MITCH
			(attempting to be 
			serious)
		What it was, probably...

				MELANIE
		Mmm?

				MITCH
		They're probably hungry, that's all.  
		This was a bad summer. They eat 
		berries and... and nuts, you know, 
		and the hills are all burned out, so 
		they're probably searching for food 
		wherever they can get it.

				MELANIE
		With my little sparrow leading team.

	She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.  
	Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror 
	story, they are becoming a little frightened.

				MITCH
		It's so damn quiet out there.

				MELANIE
		It was like that yesterday.

				MITCH
		What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		After the gulls attacked.

				MITCH
		I hadn't thought of that.
			(pause)
		And then the swifts came.

				MELANIE
		It makes you feel as if they're... 
		they're waiting or... resting... 
		or....

				MITCH
			(trying to make it 
			light again)
		No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. 
		Your sparrow is standing on a soap 
		box and...

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face dead serious.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		...waving his little wings...

	His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the 
	garden is silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming 
	slowly and with the chill of horror on them.

				MELANIE
		They were angry, Mitch. They came 
		out of the chimney in fury.
			(pause)
		I had the feeling they wanted each 
		and every one of us dead.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes 
	to him longingly.

				MITCH
		Melanie, Melanie...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened, Mitch.

				MITCH
		No, no...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened and confused and I... 
		I think I want to go back to San 
		Francisco where there are buildings 
		and... and concrete and...

				MITCH
		Melanie...

				MELANIE
		...everything I know.

	She looks up at him suddenly.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		Oh damn it, why did you have to walk 
		into that shop?

	They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

	EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK

	Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name 
	of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate.  
	Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She 
	knocks. There is no answer.

		Dan?

	She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a

	FULL SHOT - THE BARNYARD

	as Lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth.

				LYDIA

		Hi, there!

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND

	He stops the tractor, turns toward Lydia, shading his eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA

		Is Mr. Fawcett home?

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND

				FARMHAND
			(shouting back)
		I think so, ma'm. His missus is in

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Have you seen him this morning?

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND FARMHAND

	No, ma'm. I reckon he's in there, though.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(shouting it)
		Thank you!

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	as she crosses the barnyard again. There are several chickens 
	scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag 
	of feed lying against the fence.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	getting an idea.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the 
	ground.

				LYDIA
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.  
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN

	He struts up to the scattered grain.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	watching him.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN

	He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from 
	it and struts off.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction 
	strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.  
	In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you home?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window 
	closest to the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW

	A small pane of glass is broken.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	puzzled.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	The house is still and silent.

	INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT

	as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the 
	right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her 
	left and looks down a long corridor.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial 
	light into the corridor.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she 
	should leave. A determined look comes over her face.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the 
	opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you in there?

	No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing 
	the door open.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.

	SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and 
	continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A 
	standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still 
	burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass 
	shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane 
	of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its 
	top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped 
	out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near 
	decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, 
	all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, 
	and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, 
	continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its 
	PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single 
	bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, 
	one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately

	His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their 
	empty staring sockets.  Immediately

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a terrified scream erupting from her mouth.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in 
	an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she 
	is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips 
	her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still 
	screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she 
	backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

	CAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.

	FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK

	at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the 
	highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite 
	direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV

	through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend 
	leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, 
	there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in 
	the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and 
	barrels into the front yard.

	INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.  
	She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set 
	with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the 
	kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		That was Al on the phone. He wants 
		me to meet him out at the Fawcett 
		place. Says some detectives from 
		Santa Rosa'll be there in a little 
		while.
			(pause)
		Will you be all right here?

				MELANIE
		Yes. I was just taking her in some 
		tea.

	He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses 
	her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to 
	him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.

				MELANIE
		Be careful. Please.

	She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, 
	full kiss.

	FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN

	as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and 
	then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his 
	car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, 
	through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on 
	the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM

	This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a 
	life no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead 
	husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of 
	Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct 
	femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing 
	the tray.

				MELANIE
		No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought 
		you might like some tea.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

				LYDIA
		Oh, thank you.

	There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, 
	arranges the pillows behind Lydia.

				LYDIA
		Where's Mitch?

				MELANIE
		Al Malone wanted him out at the 
		Fawcett farm.

				LYDIA
		Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

				MELANIE
		He was calling from the farm, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Then he saw.

				MELANIE
		He must have. He sent for the Santa 
		Rosa police.

				LYDIA
		What good will they do?

	She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie 
	walks to the window and looks out over the bay.

				LYDIA
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		What?

				LYDIA
		Cathy. At the school.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression 
	clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all 
	right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting 
	smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Do I sound foolish to you?

				MELANIE
		No.

				LYDIA
		I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
			(she shudders)
		They have such big windows at the 
		school.
			(pause)
		All the windows were broken. In Dan's 
		bedroom. All the windows.

				MELANIE
		Try not to think of that, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		I wish I were a stronger person.  
		There is a long awkward silence. She 
		sips at her tea reflectively.

				LYDIA
		I lost my husband four years ago, 
		you know.
			(pause)
		It's odd how you depend on someone 
		for strength, and then suddenly all 
		the strength is gone, and you're 
		alone.
			(pause)
		I'd love to relax some time. I'd 
		love to be able to sleep.
			(pause; the worried 
			look again)
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie's there. She'll be all right.

				LYDIA
		I'm not this way, you know. Not 
		usually. I don't fuss and fret over 
		my children.
			(pause)
		When Frank died...
			(pause)
		You see, he knew the children, he 
		really knew them. He had the knack 
		of being able to enter into their 
		world, of becoming a part of them.  
		That's a rare talent.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		I wish I could be that way.

	There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in 
	this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her 
	husband's death, is discussing it with another person.  
	Curiously, the person is Melanie.

				LYDIA
			(honestly and simply)
		I miss him.
			(pause)
		You know, sometimes I wake up in the 
		morning, and I think 'I have to make 
		Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get 
		up and there's a... a very good reason 
		for getting out of bed until... until, 
		of course, I remember.
			(pause)
		I miss talking to him.
			(pause)
		Cathy's a child, you know, and 
		Mitch...
			(she shrugs a little 
			sadly)
		...Mitch has his own life.
			(pause)
		I'm glad he stayed here today. I 
		feel safer with him here.
			(she sighs deeply)

				MELANIE
		Would you like to rest now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		No.  No... don't go yet.
			(pause)
		I feel as if I... I don't understand 
		you. And I want so much to understand.

				MELANIE
		Why, Mrs. Brenner?

				LYDIA
		Because my son is...
			(pause)
		My son seems to be fond of you.
			(pause)
		And I...
			(pause)
		I'm not quite sure how I feel about 
		it. I really don't know if I... like 
		you or not.

				MELANIE
		Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?  
		You liking me?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I think so. My son is important 
		to me. I want to like any girl he 
		chooses.

				MELANIE
		And if you don't?

				LYDIA
			(with a faint smile)
		Then I don't suppose it'll matter 
		much to anyone but me.

				MELANIE
		I think it might also matter to Mitch.

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		Mitch has always done exactly what 
		he wanted to do.
			(pause)
		I'm not complaining. That's the mark 
		of a man.  But...
			(pause)
		You see, I... I wouldn't want to 
		be... be left alone. I don't think I 
		could bear being left alone.  I... 
		forgive me. This business with the 
		birds has me upset.  I... I don't 
		know what I'd do if Mitch weren't 
		here.

				MELANIE
			(going to the bed; 
			adjusting the pillow)
		Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
			(sighing)
		I wish I were stronger.
			(she pauses and looks 
			toward the window.)
		Do you think she's all right? Do you 
		think she's safe at the school?

				MELANIE
		Would you like me to go for her?

				LYDIA
		I couldn't ask you to.

				MELANIE
		I don't mind, really.

				LYDIA
		Would you? I'd feel so much better.

				MELANIE
		I'll just clear up here, and then 
		dress.

	She picks up the tray and starts for the door.

				LYDIA
		Melanie?

	At the door, Melanie turns.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her face soft.

				LYDIA
			(gently)
		Thank you for the tea.

	EXT. BODEGA BAY - DAY - LONG SHOT

	Melanie's car turns and goes up School Road.

	EXT. SCHOOL - DAY - MED. SHOT

	Closer shot of the car coming to a stop outside school.  
	Inside the school, we HEAR the children SINGING.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		I married my wife in the month of 
		June. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo 
		mo!

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling as she gets out of the car and heads for the school.

	The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie into the school and down the 
	corridor. The children's VOICES are LOUDER now.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She combed her hair but once a year.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, Mo, mo, mo!  
		With every rake, she shed a tear.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, 
		knickety-knackety, retro-quo-quality, 
		willoby-wallaby, Mo, mo, mo!

	Melanie is at the door to Annie's room now. She opens the 
	door and looks in.

	FULL SHOT - ANNIE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	leading the children in song. She catches sight of Melanie 
	at the door. Melanie wiggles her fingers. Annie points to 
	her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few 
	minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.  
	Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.

	EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT

	Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house.  
	Inside the children are still singing.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She swept the floor but once a year.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!  
		She swore her broom was much too

	CLOSE SHOT

	Melanie turns back and seats herself on seat in front of 
	play yard.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She churned the butter in Dad's old 
		boot. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo,

	Again five more crows arrive.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is 
	no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing 
	inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her 
	cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the 
	school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time 
	so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going 
	on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what 
	seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is 
	drawn to something above her.

	MED. SHOT - SKY

	A crows is coming down.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	She is almost looking into the play yard.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	A crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS it down, we see for the first time that the number 
	of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or 
	even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
			(throughout preceding)
		I asked my wife to wash the floor.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!

	FULL SHOT - THE INTERIOR CORRIDOR

	Melanie in headlong flight toward Annie's room.

				ANNIE (O.S.)
		All right, children. Now please put

		until I have all the songsheets.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the 
	play yard.

				ANNIE
		We're not going outside until we 
		quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me?

	The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.

				ANNIE
		All right now.

	She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door 
	from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly 
	INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of 
	the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
		wh...?

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	against a background of children's VOICES, as they react to 
	this new excitement.

				MELANIE
		Outside.

	LONG SHOT - THE CROWS - THROUGH THE WINDOWS TWO SHOT - ANNIE 
	AND MELANIE

				MELANIE
		We've got to get the children out of 
		here. These big windows... there's 
		no way to board them up.

	Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves 
	restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.

				ANNIE
		Quiet down, children! Quiet down!

	The children modulate into silence.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels wants to see how we 
		conduct ourselves during a fire drill. 
		I'd like you to...

				CHILDREN
			(grumbling in Unison)
		A fire drill? This is our play period, 
		Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc.

				ANNIE
		I'd like you to show her how quiet 
		and obedient you can be.

	The children again fall silent.

				ANNIE
		We're going to go out of the school 
		now. Those of you who live nearby 
		can go directly home. I want the 
		rest of you to go down the hill, all 
		the way to the hotel. Do you 
		understand?

				CHILDREN
		All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss 
		Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do 
		we...?

				ANNIE
			(shushing them)
		I want you to go as quietly as you 
		can, not a sound, until I tell you 
		to run. And then I want you to run 
		as fast as you can. Does everyone 
		understand?
			(pause - silence)
		All right. John, would you lead the 
		class, please?

	The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens 
	it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the 
	play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - A SINGLE CROW

	fluttering at the window, almost in exploration. He hangs 
	there for a moment, then wings back to the playground 
	equipment.

	A low angle of five or six crows filling the screen.

	EXT. PLAY YARD

	The screen is filled with crows. About fifty or more. All of 
	a sudden we HEAR the distant PATTERING of children's feet as 
	they start running. Immediately the crows rise and the CAMERA 
	PANS UP with them into the sky.

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as 
	DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his 
	wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A 
	DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of 
	booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in 
	his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and 
	efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another 
	table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing 
	and clowning around throughout following at a table in the 
	rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the 
	counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.  
	Over her head, the television set is blasting with its 
	perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

				MELANIE
		Daddy, there were hundreds of them.  
		No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying 
		to tell you this as calmly as I know 
		how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
			(she takes a deep 
			breath)
		Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes 
		ago.

	The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing 
	walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking 
	woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through 
	foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what 
	Melanie is saying.

				MELANIE
		At the school. No, I don't. Just a 
		minute.
			(to Deke)
		What's the name of the school?

				DEKE
		Just the Bodega Bay School.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Help you, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I need some change, Mr. Carter.

	As Deke opens cash register...

				MELANIE
		The Bodega Bay School.
			(to Deke)
		Could you turn that down, please?

	Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.

				MELANIE
		I don't know how many children.
		Thirty or forty. Yes.

	Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to 
	Melanie.

				MELANIE
		No, the birds didn't attack until 
		the children were outside the school. 
		Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. 
		Is there a difference between crows 
		and blackbirds?

				MRS. BUNDY
			(turning from machine)
		There is very definitely a difference, 
		Miss.

				MELANIE
		They're different, Daddy.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Thank you.
			(into phone)
		I think these were crows. Yes, 
		hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked 
		the children, attacked them.
			(exasperated)
		Daddy, a little girl was sent to the 
		hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all 
		right, but you act as if I'm... all 
		right, all right.
			(pause)
		No, I can't come home now. I just 
		can't, Daddy. How is it there? I 
		mean... are there birds? In the sky?  
		But no trouble. Well, I hope...
			(pause)
		I don't know when. I simply can't 
		leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.  
		All right, Daddy, good-by.

	She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They're both perching birds, of 
		course, but of quite different 
		species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. 
		The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.
			(to Deke)
		Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

				DEKE
		In the book right here, Miss.

	As Melanie looks it up...

				DEKE
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		I don't see what difference it makes, 
		Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If 
		they attacked the school, that's 
		pretty serious.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(with a superior smile)
		I hardly think either species would 
		have the intelligence to launch a 
		massed attack. Their brain pans aren't 
		large enough for such...

				MELANIE
			(dialing)
		I just came from the school, madam.  
		I don't know about their brain pans 
		but...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not aggressive creatures, 
		Miss. They bring beauty to the world. 
		It is mankind, rather, who...

				HELEN
			(going to door leading 
			to kitchen)
		Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.  
		Baked potato on all of them.

	LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

				MELANIE
			(into phone)
		Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, 
		please?
			(pause)
		Yes, I'll wait.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(continuing to Deke)
		...insist on making it difficult for 
		life to survive on this planet. If 
		it weren't for birds...

				DEKE
		Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to 
		understand. This young lady says 
		there was an attack on the school.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Impossible.

				MELANIE
			(in background)
		Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.  
		Something terrible has happened.

	Her background conversation continues through following:

				DRUNK
			(suddenly)
		It's the end of the world!

				HELEN
		What's this about the school?

				DEKE
		Bunch of crows attacked the school, 
		Helen.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.
			(suddenly quoting)
		"Thus saith the Lord God to the 
		mountains, and to the hills, to the 
		rivers and to the valleys; Behold, 
		I, even I, will bring a sword upon 
		you, and I will destroy your high 
		places.

				HELEN
		The Lord's not destroying anything, 
		Jason.

				DRUNK
		"In all your dwelling places, the 
		cities shall be laid waste, and the 
		high places shall be laid waste!"
			(he nods)
		Ezekiel, Chapter six.

				HELEN
			(quoting)
		"Woe unto them that rise up early in 
		the morning that they may follow 
		strong drink."

				DRUNK
			(nodding)
		Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of 
		the world.

				MELANIE
		Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.  
		Good-by.
			(she hangs up)

				MRS. BUNDY
			(laughing)
		I hardly think a few birds are going 
		to bring about the end of the world.

				MELANIE
			(turning to her)
		These weren't a few birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN

	waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; 
	becoming very nervous.

	BACK TO SCENE

				DEKE
		I didn't even know there were many 
		crows in Bodega Bay this time of 
		year.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The crow is a permanent resident 
		throughout its range. In fact, during 
		our Christmas Count, we recorded...

	CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES

	eating.

				SHOLES
			(suddenly, from his 
			table)
		How many gulls did you count, Mrs.  
		Bundy?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MRS. BUNDY
		Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are 
		several varieties.

				SHOLES
		The ones that've been raising the 
		devil with my fishing boats.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Probably herring gulls. They arrive 
		in November, you know, and don't 
		migrate North again until March or...

				MELANIE
			(leaping upon this)
		Have you had trouble with gulls?

				SHOLES
		One of my boats did last week.

				DEKE
			(making a connection)
		This young lady got hit by a gull 
		only Saturday.

				SAM'S VOICE
			(from kitchen)
		Pick up the chicken.

				HELEN
		Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was 
		crows.
			(she picks up tray, 
			shrugs, goes to table)
		Deke, I'm still waiting for those 
		Bloody Marys!

				DEKE
		Coming right up!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really 
	frightened.

				WOMAN
		Could you ask them to lower their 
		voices, please? They're frightening 
		the children.

				LITTLE GIRL
		Timmy has a canary.

				HELEN
		That's nice. Are you Timmy?

				LITTLE BOY
		My cousin is Timmy.

	BACK TO SCENE

				SAM'S VOICE
			(leaving table, coming 
			to bar)
		A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized 
		one of my boats.  Practically tore 
		of the skipper's arm.

				HELEN
			(coming back)
		You're scaring the kids. Keep it 
		low.

				DEKE
		You're scaring me, too. Are you trying 
		to say all these...
			(he shakes his head)
		That sounds impossible, Sebastian.

				SHOLES
		I'm only telling you what happened 
		to my boat.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The gulls were after your fish, Mr.  
		Sholes. Really, let's be logical 
		about this.

				MELANIE
		What were the crows after at the 
		school?

				MRS. BUNDY
		What do you think they were after, 
		Miss...?

				MELANIE
		Daniels. I think they were after the 
		children.

				MRS. BUNDY
		For what purpose?

				MELANIE
		To...
			(she hesitates)
		To kill them.

	There is a long silence.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Why?

	Another silence.

				MELANIE
		I don't know why.

				MRS. BUNDY
		I thought not. Birds have been on 
		this planet since archaeopteryx, 
		Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty 
		million years ago!

	A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait 
		all that time to start a... a war 
		against humanity?

				MELANIE
		No one called it a war!

				SALESMAN
		Scotch, light on the water.

				MRS. BUNDY
		You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying 
		as much.

				HELEN
		Are you finished here, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
		Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Who said anything about war? All I 
		said was that some gulls...

				HELEN
			(yelling to kitchen)
		One apple pie! You want more coffee?

				SHOLES
		No. ...came down on one of my boats.  
		They could have been after the fish, 
		just as you said.

				SALESMAN
		Your captain should have shot at 
		them.

				SHOLES
		What?

				SALESMAN
		Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most 
		birds are. If you ask me, we should 
		wipe them all out. World would be 
		better off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(outraged)
		Birds?

				SALESMAN
		Yeah, birds. All they do is make a 
		mess of everything. Who needs them?

				MRS. BUNDY
		We need them.

				SALESMAN
		Not if they're starting a war.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They are incapable of organized 
		warfare!

				MELANIE
		Have you ever seen a jay protecting 
		a nest?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I have seen jays doing everything it 
		is conceivable for jays to do.  
		Ornithology happens to be my 
		avocation, Miss Daniels. You're 
		talking about preservation of the 
		species, a hen protecting her young.  
		There's a vast difference between...

				MELANIE
		Maybe they're all protecting the 
		species. Maybe they're tired of being 
		shot at and roasted in ovens and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Are you discussing gamebirds now?  
		All birds are not gamebirds, you 
		know.

				MELANIE
		I don't know anything about birds 
		except that they're attacking this 
		town.

				SALESMAN
		Then fight back. Get yourselves guns 
		and wipe them off the face of the 
		earth.

				MRS. BUNDY
		That would hardly be possible.

				DEKE
		Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Because there are 8,650 species of 
		birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. 
		It's estimated that five billion, 
		seven hundred and fifty million birds 
		live in the United States alone. The 
		five continents of the world...

				SALESMAN
			(muttering)
		Kill them all. Get rid of them.  
		Messy animals.

				MRS. BUNDY
		...probably contain more than a 
		hundred billion birds!

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world!

				DEKE
		Well, we seem to have more than our 
		share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.  
		Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe 
		they've all gone crazy.

				HELEN
		Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want 
		it at the table?

				SHOLES
		No. Here's fine.
			(he begins eating)

				HELEN
		Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?

				DEKE
		Coming.

				HELEN
			(angrily)
		Are we running a business here -- or 
		a bird sanctuary?

				SHOLES
			(beginning to change 
			his mind)
		Actually, those gulls must have been 
		after the fish.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course.

				SHOLES
		Makes a lot more sense than... well, 
		an attack.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course it does. If we believe 
		that birds are attacking, why... why 
		next we'll believe that grasshoppers 
		and cockroaches are capable of...

				DRUNK
		Cockroaches!  Urghh!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	getting more and more anxious.

				WOMAN
		Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.

				BOY
		Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

				SHOLES
		Maybe we're all getting a little 
		carried away by this. Admittedly, a 
		few birds acted strangely. That's no 
		reason to believe...

				MELANIE
		This isn't a few birds! I keep telling 
		you that! These are gulls and swifts 
		and crows and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

				MELANIE
		Maybe! Is it impossible?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Yes. I have never known birds of 
		different species to flock together.  
		The very concept is unimaginable.
			(laughing)
		Why if that happened, we wouldn't 
		have a chance. How could we possible 
		hope to fight them?

				SHOLES
		We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.  
		Bundy.

				WOMAN
			(calling from table)
		Excuse me, may I have a check, please?

				HELEN
			(concerned)
		Is everything all right, ma'am?

				WOMAN
		Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the 
		road.

				SAM
			(coming from kitchen)
		What's the matter? Something wrong 
		out here?

				DEKE
		Nothing's wrong.

				SAM
		All this shouting.

				MRS. BUNDY
		We're fighting a war, Sam.

				SAM
		A war? Against who? Did the 
		Russians...?

				SHOLES
		Against birds.

				WOMAN
			(suddenly)
		I'm glad you all think this is so 
		amusing. You've frightened my children 
		half out of their wits.

				BOY
		I'm not scared, Mommy.

				WOMAN
		Keep quiet. If that young lady saw 
		an attack on the school, why won't 
		you believe her?

				SAM
		What attack? Who attacked the school?

				WOMAN
		Birds did. Crows! And you're all 
		sitting around here debating! What 
		do you want them to do next? Crash 
		through that window?

				LITTLE GIRL
			(frightened by her 
			mother)
		Mommy!

				WOMAN
		Quiet! Why don't you all get home?  
		Lock your doors and windows!
			(her hysteria rising)
		Put on your coats, children!
			(to Deke)
		What's the fastest road to San 
		Francisco?

				DEKE
		The freeway, ma'am.

				WOMAN
		Where do I get it?

				SALESMAN
		I'm going out that way, lady. You 
		can follow me.

				WOMAN
		Then let's go. Now!

				SALESMAN
		I haven't finished my drink.

				WOMAN
			(on edge of panic, 
			shouting at her 
			children)
		Put on your coats! Do you want to 
		get trapped here?

				BOY
		I can't find my scarf.

				WOMAN
		Look in your sleeve!

	The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.

				MITCH
		Melanie?

	At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.

				MITCH
			(going to her)
		I got here as fast as I could.  
		Where's Cathy?

				MELANIE
		At Annie's house. She's all right.

				SAM
		Al, why aren't you over there where 
		the attack was?

				MALONE
		Because I just got back from Dan 
		Fawcett's place, that's why.

				MITCH
		He was killed last night. By birds.

				MALONE
		Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know 
		that for a fact.

				MRS. BUNDY
		What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

				MALONE
		Santa Rosa police think it was a 
		felony murder. They think a burglar 
		broke in and killed him.

				WOMAN
		Were the Santa Rosa police at your 
		school today?
			(impatiently, to 
			salesman)
		Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		Take it easy, lady.
			(through window)
		There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

				DRUNK
			(quoting)
		"Look at the birds of the air: they 
		do not sow or read, yet your heavenly 
		father feeds them."

				WOMAN
		I'll never feed another bird as long 
		as I live!

				SALESMAN
		Something like this happened in Santa 
		Cruz last year. The town was covered 
		with seagulls.

				WOMAN
		Can't you please finish your drink?

				MRS. BUNDY
		That's right, sir, I recall it. A 
		large flock of seagulls got lost in 
		a fog and headed in for the town, 
		where all the lights were.

				SALESMAN
		They made some mess, too, smashing 
		into houses and everything.
			(shaking his head)
		They always make a mess. We're better 
		off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The point is that no one seemed to 
		get upset about it. They were gone 
		the next morning, just as if nothing 
		at all had happened. Poor things.

				WOMAN
		I'm leaving! Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		All right, all right!
			(he downs his drink)
		Hope you figure this out, folks.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.

	The Tides is silent for a moment.

				SHOLES
		Well, I'd better get back to the 
		cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

				DEKE
		Let's see. Scallops and coffee...

				MITCH
		Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.

	Sholes turns to him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face very serious.

				MITCH
		Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

				SHOLES
		No one ever said you were, Mitch.

				MITCH
			(flatly)
		I think we're in trouble. I don't 
		know how or why this started, but I 
		know it's here and I know we'd be 
		crazy to ignore it.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(sarcastically)
		Ignore what? The bird war?

				MITCH
			(exploding)
		Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, 
		the bird plague, you can call it 
		what you want to, they're out there 
		massing someplace and they'll be 
		back, you can count on that!

				MRS. BUNDY
		Ridiculous!

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home 
		and polish your binoculars?

				SAM
		Go on, Mitch.

				MITCH
		If we don't do something now, if we 
		don't get Bodega Bay on the move...

				SHOLES
		Look, Mitch, even if this is true, 
		even if all the birds...

				MITCH
		Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
			(after a long pause)
		No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't 
		see any reason for it.

				MITCH
		It's happening. Isn't that a good 
		enough reason?

				SHOLES
			(thoughtfully)
		I like Bodega Bay as well as any 
		man. If I thought...
			(he shakes his head)

				MITCH
		Then help me, Sebastian. You're an 
		important man in this town. If you'll 
		help, the rest will.

				SHOLES
		Help how? What do you want to do?

				MITCH
		I'm not sure, but...

				SHOLES
		If you don't even know what you want 
		to do...

				MELANIE
		Listen to him, please.

				SAM
			(taking position beside 
			Melanie)
		You listen to him, Sebastian!

				MITCH
		I only know we've got to drive them 
		away from town -- before they drive 
		us away.

				SHOLES
		How?

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, you said something about 
		Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting 
		lost in the fog, and heading in for 
		the lights.

				DEKE
		We don't have any fog this time of 
		year, Mitch.

				MITCH
		We'll make our own fog.

				SHOLES
		How do you plan to do that?

				MITCH
		With smoke.

				MALONE
		There's an ordinance against burning 
		anything in this town, unless it's...

				MITCH
		We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army 
		uses.

				DEKE
		What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad 
		as birds.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not bad!

				SHOLES
		How can we go on living here if we 
		blanket the town with smoke?

				MITCH
		Can we go on living here otherwise?

	Pause. They are silent.

				SAM
			(slowly)
		It's worth a try, Sebastian.

	There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:

				MELANIE
		Look!

	They turn toward the window.

	TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT

	Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or 
	four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of 
	the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the 
	window and out to the left.

				DEKE
			(alarmed)
		Gulls!

				MITCH
		They're back!

				SHOLES
		They're only the usual... What are 
		you...

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the 
	attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is 
	seen disappearing into the men's room.

	INT. TIDES

	A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the 
	Tides Restaurant.

	TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT

	A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man 
	on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and 
	then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out 
	and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep 
	by.  The gas begins to flow away.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie 
	after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see 
	people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas 
	station. At the door, Mitch turns.

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Stay back in here.

	Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.  
	They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at 
	the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the 
	window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to 
	rescue the attacked gas station attendant.

	Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter 
	away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in 
	the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks 
	down.

	TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT

	on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is 
	flowing to the right into the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE

	flowing down to the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.

	MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS

	along the flowing gas back to the station.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She turns back to the car park.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked 
	below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, 
	has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of 
	lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the 
	happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn 
	attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the 
	man.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As 
	he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and 
	he drops it.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her horror-stricken face.

	FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA

	Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's 
	car, and the one next to it go up in flames.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	TURNING TO SEE

	FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

	The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, 
	following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, 
	which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured 
	attendant.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT

	A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the 
	town rushing around the car park and the streets across the 
	highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see 
	automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil 
	smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the 
	parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and 
	have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the 
	foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill 
	with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes 
	obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop 
	down on the town.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone 
	booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing 
	out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin 
	to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the 
	restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:

				MELANIE
		Mitch...! Mitch!

	We see her look up to the sky.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	The sky is full of seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again 
	to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in 
	the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE

	slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all 
	around her.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people 
	who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with 
	clouds of birds coming on them.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her 
	eyes for Mitch.

	MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the 
	direction of the car park.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water 
	from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning 
	cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around 
	them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her eyes turn up quickly.

	LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.  
	Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner 
	coming toward her in the phone booth.  We can see birds flying 
	in and out of the windows of the car.  We can see the arm 
	and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the 
	background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

	CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	as the car comes toward her in the booth.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.

	CLOSER SHOT

	A side view of the car after practically scraping the side 
	of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the 
	driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently 
	give us a view of its interior.

	FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	watching the car.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It 
	explodes.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no 
	avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down 
	and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight 
	turn, now sees:

	THE TIDES TOWN

	The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop 
	their hose.

	CLOSER SHOT

	shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the 
	water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows 
	of the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window 
	she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the 
	left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its 
	palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and 
	leaping and kicking its van to pieces.

	At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of 
	a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.  
	His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are 
	covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.  
	Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides 
	Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, 
	the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and 
	waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of 
	recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls 
	crash around the booth causing her to go back.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE

	looking out again toward Mitch.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction 
	while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning 
	building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. 
	Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the 
	smoking building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking across in horror.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly 
	Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls 
	down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, 
	another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the 
	window as Mitch drops the child.

	FLASH - MELANIE

	watching this breathlessly.

	CLOSER SHOT

	The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.  
	He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the 
	windows. They disappear into the building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	holding her breath.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	getting more desperate.

	CLOSEUP - BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window 
	and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	sees her and starts running toward the booth.

	HIGH SHOT - MITCH

	beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.

	LOW SHOT

	close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag 
	Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the 
	CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.

	INT. THE TIDES

	There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the 
	windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The 
	CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very 
	hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.  
	There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can 
	hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a 
	woman's voice SCREAMS out:

				WOMAN
		Why are they doing it?! Why are they 
		doing it...?!

	Some of the heads of the group turn.

	CLOSE SHOT

	It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.  
	Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and 
	helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some 
	words.

				MRS. BUNDY
			([Mrs. Bundy offers a 
			weak explanation of 
			why the birds could 
			have gone berserk 
			like this. This 
			information should 
			be obtained from Dr. 
			Stager.])

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over 
	their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.

				MITCH
			(looking up)
		I think they're going.

	Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud 
	CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.

	MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, 
	we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has 
	gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who 
	are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the 
	window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the 
	street.

				MITCH
		I think it's safe to get out now.

				MELANIE
		Don't let's take any chances.

				MITCH
		We've got to get Cathy.

	They open the door and make their way out into the street, 
	running and looking about them desperately.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched 
	on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the 
	sidewalk.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as 
	they move along past the last street and come into the more 
	countrified part of the town.

	LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD

	We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which 
	we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the 
	school roof.

	SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks 
	up, Melanie following his look.

	SKY SHOT - FULL

	of wheeling gulls.

	SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the 
	school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

	There are a few blackbirds on it.

				MELANIE'S VOICE
		Look... the crows again.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.

				MELANIE
		Careful, Mitch. The crows may be 
		back in the play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play 
	yard, we see what they see.

	MED. SHOT

	THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of 
	crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	They walk stealthily past.

	CLOSE SHOT

	CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they 
	approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over 
	her shoulder toward the crows.

	EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

	Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE

	A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the 
	door.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He reaches the body. He rolls it over.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	dead.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	The shock registering on his face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment 
	what Mitch's reaction will be.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's 
	face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket 
	and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to 
	keep her warm. He turns away then.

	MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW

	with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, 
	with her eyes peering at something outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning to follow Cathy's gaze.

	CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS

	Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD

	As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at 
	the birds. Melanie dashes forward.

				MELANIE
			(as the birds flutter 
			into the air)
		Mitch! Don't!

	She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he 
	maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are 
	now hovering flight.

				MELANIE
		Please! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of 
		here!

	Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the 
	house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a 
	state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds 
	Cathy to her.

	CLOSER THREE SHOT

	as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.

				MELANIE
		Mitch, you can't leave her out there.

	He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder 
	is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and 
	then a door is CLOSED.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer 
	in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

	MED. SHOT

	He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the 
	three of them as they silently make their way past the crows 
	once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out 
	cautiously to the right.

	MED. SHOT

	CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.

	BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE

	They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.

	MED. SHOT

	Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE

	The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go 
	toward the waiting car.

	MED. SHOT

	They arrive at the car.

				MELANIE
		You drive, Mitch.

	She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch 
	slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the 
	CAMERA and goes down the school road.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie 
	looks over her shoulder.

				MELANIE
			(holding her breath)
		I don't think they're coming.

	Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes 
	wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then 
	suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as 
	the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.

				CATHY
		On our way back from taking Michele 
		home... we... we heard the explosion 
		and went outside to... see what... 
		what it was.
			(pause)
		All at once the... the birds were 
		everywhere. All at once.  She... she 
		pushed me inside and... they covered 
		her.
			(pause)
		Annie.
			(pause)
		She pushed me inside.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.

							  DISSOLVE

	CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA 
	TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings 
	to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues 
	low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting 
	there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, 
	not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the 
	Brenner house in the distance.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed 
	across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two 
	attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

	LONG SHOT - THE BAY

	covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is 
	still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where 
	the ladder leans against the side of the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, 
	carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She 
	is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is 
	not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her 
	hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked 
	with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there 
	is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she 
	stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

				MELANIE
		The town looks clear.

				MITCH
		The bay doesn't.

				MELANIE
		How long have they been gathering 
		there?

				MITCH
		The past fifteen minutes.
			(pause)
		It seems to be a pattern, doesn't 
		it? They strike and disappear, and 
		then they start massing again.

	Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.

				MELANIE
		I keep thinking of Annie.
			(she squeezes her 
			eyes shut)

				MITCH
			(after a long pause)
		It... it doesn't look very different, 
		does it? A little smoke over the 
		town, but otherwise...

				MELANIE
			(looking)
		Even the birds sitting out there.  
		It does look very much the same, 
		Mitch. This could be last week.

				MITCH
		It may not be last week again for a 
		long long time.

	They are both silent.

				MELANIE
		Look. They're still coming.

	Mitch nods. Silence.

				MITCH
		Do you want to try your father again?
			(Melanie shakes her 
			head.  Puzzled, Mitch 
			looks at her)

				MELANIE
		I tried a little while ago. The 
		phone's dead.

				MITCH
		Have we still got power?

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(leaning against him)
		I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very 
		tired.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch! I'm getting something on the 
		radio!

	INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

	Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a 
	footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the 
	room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from 
	the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

				LYDIA
		I can't get any of the local stations.  
		I think this is San Francisco.

				ANNOUNCER
		...would include formulation of a 
		central financing committee to handle 
		credit and to allocate responsibility 
		for the various facets of the project. 
		A vote on the motion is expected 
		early tomorrow morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	listening.

				ANNOUNCER
		Continuing with the local news, police 
		are still investigating the series 
		of valuable jade burglaries in the 
		Chinatown area. The round-up of known 
		criminals has not as yet produced a 
		suspect, but Commissioner Nelson 
		said today he was certain the 
		burglaries were quote linked and the 
		work of the team of professionals 
		unquote.
			(pause)
		In Bodega Bay early this morning, a 
		large flock of crows attacked a group 
		of children who were leaving the 
		school during a fire drill. One little 
		girl was seriously injured and taken 
		to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but 
		the majority of children reached 
		safety in the town.
			(pause)
		On the national scene today, the 
		opening of the new session of Congress 
		was marked by a State of the Union 
		address that...

				MITCH
		Is that all?

				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		...drew a standing ovation for the 
		President. The Chief Executive, in 
		discussing our relation to Europe 
		and the rest of the world community 
		said: "These various elements of our 
		foreign policy lead as I have said 
		to a single goal --

				MITCH
			(sighing)
		We're going to need more wood for 
		the fire. We can't let it go out.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing as drone 
			in background)
		The goal of a peaceful world of free 
		and independent states.  This is our 
		guide for the present and our vision 
		for the future -- a free community 
		of nations, independent but 
		interdependent, uniting north and 
		south, east and west, in one great 
		family of man, outgrowing and 
		transcending the hates and fears 
		that rend our age.  We will not reach 
		that goal today or tomorrow.  We may 
		not reach it in our lifetime.  But 
		the quest is the great adventure of 
		our century.  We sometimes chafe at 
		the burdens of our obligations, the 
		complexity of our decisions, the 
		agony of our choices, but there is 
		no comfort or security for us in 
		evasion, no solution in abdication, 
		no relief in irresponsibility.
			(pause)
		In assuming the tasks of the 
		Presidency, I said that few 
		generations, in all history, had 
		been granted the role of being the 
		great defender of freedom in its 
		hour of maximum danger.  This is our 
		good fortune, and I welcome it now 
		as I did when I first took office.
			(pause)
		For it is the fate of this generation -- 
		Of you in the Congress and of me as 
		President -- to live with a struggle 
		we did not start, in a world we did -
		not make. But the pressures of life 
		are not always distributed by choice. 
		And while no nation has ever faced 
		such a challenge, no nation has ever 
		been ready to seize the burden and 
		the glory of...

				LYDIA
			(pause)
		Did you you get the windows in the 
		attic, Mitch?

				MITCH
		 I got them all, Mother.

				LYDIA
		When do you think they'll come?

				MITCH
		I don't know.

				LYDIA
		If there are... larger birds, Mitch... 
		they'll get into the house.

				MITCH
		That's a chance we have to take.

				LYDIA
		Maybe we ought to leave.

				MITCH
		Not now.  Not while they're massing 
		out there.

				LYDIA
		When? 

				MITCH
		I don't know when.  We'll see what...

				LYDIA
		Where will we go?

				MITCH
		I don't know yet.  I think we'll be 
		safe here.
			(Pause)
		Let's bring that wood in.

				LYDIA
		What happens when we run out of wood?

	Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and 
	long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the 
	tension being played in front of it.

				MITCH
		I don't know. We'll break up the 
		furni...

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		You don't know, you don't know!  
		When will you know? When we're all 
		dead? Like Annie?

				CATHY
			(shrieking it, her 
			face white)
		Mother!

				LYDIA
			(at Mitch)
		If your father were here...

				MITCH
			(sharply)
		Mother! I'm trying my best!
			(shaking his head)
		I'm... trying... my...

				LYDIA
			(trembling, nodding)
		I'm sorry, Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly.

				MITCH
		Let's get the wood. Why don't you 
		make us all some coffee, Mother?

	FULL SHOT - HOUSE

	as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.  
	There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they 
	begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly 
	scan the sky.

	FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS

	flying in tight formation.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Where are they heading?

				MITCH
		Inland.

				MELANIE
		Santa Rosa?

				MITCH
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. 
	It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa 
	Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.

				MITCH (O.S.)
			(gently)
		Come on. Let's get this wood in.

	Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and 
	her eyes remain on the sky.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we 
	can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the 
	sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.  
	There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, 
	kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace 
	putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room 
	and dumps another load.

				MELANIE
		That's the last of it.

				LYDIA
		Did you close the door?

				MELANIE
		And locked it.

				CATHY
		Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in 
		here?

				LYDIA
			(snapping it)
		No!

				CATHY
		Mom, they're in a cage!

				LYDIA
		They're birds!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.

				MITCH
			(softly)
		Let them stay in the other room.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent 
	except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more 
	wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still 
	are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in 
	the house.

				CATHY
		Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The 
		birds.

				MITCH
			(putting wood on fire)
		I don't know, honey.

				CATHY
		Why are they trying to kill people?

				MITCH
		I wish I could say. But if I could 
		answer that, I could also tell you 
		why people are trying to kill people.

	The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the 
	lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall 
	silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, 
	her eyes widening.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of 
	their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of 
	splintering glass.

				LYDIA
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhh.

	Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, 
	the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes 
	of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards 
	and the outside of the house begins building, almost like 
	muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. 
	Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, 
	is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section 
	entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the 
	roof.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She 
	squeezes her eyes shut.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, 
	there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat

	of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
	tat. Tat-

				CATHY
			(in terror)
		I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I 
		want to throw...

	Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.

				MELANIE
		I'll go with you.

	They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR 
	Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling 
	of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of 
	birds striking the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the 
	birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his 
	watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back 
	door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
	dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  
	He cannot tell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a 
	NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing 
	sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	coming into the entry hall.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR

	The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside 
	assail the door.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining 
	room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it 
	toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and 
	piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, 
	CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags 
	it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table 
	when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with 
	alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is 
	and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of 
	desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The 
	CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din 
	now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

				MELANIE
		When will they stop?

				MITCH
		I thought they'd have stopped by 
		now.

				MELANIE
		What time is it?

				MITCH
		Almost two a.m.

				MELANIE
		You must be exhausted.

				MITCH
		How about you?

	She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their 
	cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready 
	to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the 
	chair, goes to the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the birds, wondering.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their 
	expressions. Malice or benevolence?

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	watching, unmoving.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER

	as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  
	One of them tweets.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wonder if Cathy fed them.

	He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, 
	takes out a small box of bird feed.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE

	as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  
	His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
	small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
	Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
	The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
	small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
	in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
	tweeting, they begin to eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
	against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  
	Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, 
	pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

				MITCH
			(holding her)
		You should have left when you wanted 
		to.

	She shakes her head.

				MITCH
		You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		I don't want to be safe. I want to 
		be with you.

	There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like 
	a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, 
	Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand 
	in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of 
	night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

				MITCH
			(in the darkness)
		The power.

				MELANIE
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Wait here. Don't move.

	The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the 
	blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the 
	SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes 
	on.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as 
	he directs the beam upwards.

				MITCH
		We'd better light some of those lamps.

				MELANIE
		No... wait.
			(pause)
		Hold me.

	In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is 
	almost black in the room except for the strange effect of 
	the flashlight as he holds it behind her.

				MITCH
		I think they're easing off.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the 
	fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep 
	on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  
	Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly 
	and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer 
	the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another 
	SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a 
	steady dribbling, difficult to place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.

				MELANIE
			(whispering)
		Mitch?

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns toward him.

				MELANIE
			(still whispering)
		Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	asleep.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming 
	from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, 
	picks up a very long flashlight.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the 
	entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled 
	against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into 
	the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam 
	on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor 
	outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, 
	goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's 
	all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second 
	bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first 
	door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light 
	on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, 
	goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to 
	the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back 
	toward the door when she stops.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR

	a pile of chipped and broken plaster.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING

	A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, 
	and suddenly, her eyes open wide.

	CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL

	sitting in the darkness, staring at her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	reacting.

	QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL

	wings spread in the beam of light.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering 
	back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the

	FULL SHOT - THE CEILING

	a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward 
	her.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds 
	attack her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is 
	a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering 
	wings.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie, open the door!

	He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie 
	struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed 
	by the birds.

	She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the 
	spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering 
	of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault 
	on the door by Mitch outside.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
			(screaming)
		Mitch, get her out of there!

	MED. SHOT - THE ROOM

	Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in 
	view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see 
	on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	The door begins to open.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He 
	begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for 
	Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins 
	dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been 
	shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  
	We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch 
	pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut 
	behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at 
	the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

				MITCH
		Mother, get a rope!

				LYDIA
		Oh, my God, look at her!

				MITCH
			(shouting)
		Get a rope!

	She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  
	There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He 
	will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his 
	hand, knocking the club from it.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his 
	hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  
	Another bird flutters into the corridor.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his 
	hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and 
	is immediately attacked by the other bird.

				MITCH
			(yelling)
		Mother! Hurry!

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a 
	heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily 
	to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and 
	compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the 
	doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
	the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to 
	Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia 
	following. As they go downstairs:

				MITCH
		Cathy! Get a blanket and some 
		bandages!

				CATHY
			(at the foot of the 
			stars, on the verge 
			of tears)
		Is she all right?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

				MELANIE
		I'm... I'm....

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the 
	couch.

				MITCH
		Just lie there and keep still.

	Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  
	By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over 
	Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands 
	are trembling, and he drops it.

				LYDIA
		Let me do that, Mitch.

	She picks up the bandage.

				MITCH
		I can handle it.

				LYDIA
		I know you can.
			(her eyes meet his)
		But I'd like to.

	He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Please don't mess me up with bandages, 
		Mrs. Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Shhhh. Shhhh.

				MELANIE
		Please.

	But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the 
	cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

				LYDIA
			(as she works)
		I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

				MITCH
		You're doing fine.

				LYDIA
			(Apologizing)
		I mean. I want to...

	Pause.

				CATHY
		Listen!

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to 
	hear.

				LYDIA
		They're gone. God have mercy, they're 
		gone.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the 
	table and chair. He opens the door a crack.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD

	through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no 
	birds visible.

	FULL SHOT - THE DOOR

	from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred 
	and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds 
	spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is 
	directly behind him.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	a shambles, all the windows broken.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				MITCH
		They're gone. The same pattern.

				LYDIA
		But they'll be back.

				MITCH
		We won't be here.

				LYDIA
		Where can we go, Mitch? There's no 
		place to go.

				MITCH
		I want to try for San Francisco.  
		There are buildings there. Steel and 
		concrete!

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		We'd never make it. They're probably 
		all over the road.

				MITCH
		We have to try it.
			(a long silence)
		We can't stay here.
			(silence)
		Melanie needs help.
			(silence)
		Mother, the house won't take another 
		attack.

				LYDIA
		If...
			(pause)
		If... when we get to San Francisco...
			(pause)
		If they're already there?

				MITCH
		They won't be.

				LYDIA
		If they are?

				MITCH
		We'll worry about that when we get 
		there.

				LYDIA
		I'm frightened, terribly frightened.  
		I... I don't know what's out there, 
		Mitch.

				MITCH
		What do we have to know, Mother?  
		We're all together, we all love each 
		other, we all need each other. What 
		else is there? Mother, I want us to 
		stay alive!

				LYDIA
			(nodding; then after 
			a pause)
		I started to say... inside...

				MITCH
		You don't have to.

	He holds out his hand to her.

				MITCH
		I think we'd better get started.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD

	It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before 
	dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following 
	until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is 
	deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's 
	convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house 
	together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the 
	back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background 
	is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia 
	comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking 
	down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the 
	house.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just 
	outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking back at her.

	FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA

	Across the expanse of the desolated yard.

				CATHY
		May I take them, Mitch?

	He does not answer. She continues looking at him.

				CATHY
		They haven't harmed anyone.

				LYDIA
		Take them.

				MITCH
			(with a slow nod)
		We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

	He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  
	The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front 
	seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, 
	and looks toward the trees.

	MED. SHOT - THE TREES

	covered with waiting birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	getting into car.

				MITCH
		Be careful with that door.

	Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch 
	does the same with his door.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Mitch, if they hear the car 
		starting... if they see movement...

				MITCH
		We'll take it slow until we get to 
		the main road.
			(pause)
		Are you ready?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND

	turning the key. The motor springs to life.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	anticipation on all the faces.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he takes a deep breath)
		Here we go.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is 
	still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it 
	passes the gate and starts down the road.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small 
	fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  
	The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the 
	road.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW

	She gasps quickly.

	MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE

	standing, waiting silently.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	as the tension begins to starts.

				MITCH
		Shhh.  Shhhh.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with 
	waiting seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning toward the side of the road ahead.

	FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	covered with waiting birds.

				CATHY
			(whispering)
		Mitch, let's turn back.

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhhhh.

	MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE

	as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front 
	porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his 
	hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded 
	window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	reacting.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.

	as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding 
	road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
	standing wires, watching, waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as 
	the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of 
	birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every 
	pole, on every fence.

				LYDIA
		Mitch!

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as he stops the car and looks ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened, try not to reveal her fear.

				MELANIE
		Can we turn back?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		I... I don't think so. If we get 
		through town, I think we'll be all 
		right.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest 
	reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, 
	who makes the decision.

				MELANIE
		Then go ahead, Mitch.

	FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR

	as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow 
	rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	as she turns to look out the window on her side.

	CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS

	as the car moves past them slowly.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	closing her eyes.

	FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE

	through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with 
	birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all 
	over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the 
	open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the 
	gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken 
	windows.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH

	The tension on their faces,

	MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES

	as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and 
	merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere, 
	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN

	lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his 
	arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	strained, looking at the road ahead.

	LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

	a clear sky, a bird-free stretch,

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
			(almost as a prayer)
		Here we go.
			(he rams down on the 
			accelerator)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR

	as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead 
	in a burst of speed.

	FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS

	taking wing.

	MED. SHOT - MORE BIRDS

	taking wing.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	screaming.

				MELANIE
		Mitch!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

	through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing 
	immediately ahead.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD

	from the inside, as birds flutter against it.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR

	from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin 
	line of light.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching at the wheel again, another bend.

	HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR

	navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it 
	in straight lines.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over 
	their heads, letting in more light.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	More slashes, more light in scattered beams.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the 
	memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the 
	owl.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the 
	incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(almost a prayer)
		Dear God... dear God... please, 
		please, what have we done? Please.
			(and then in anger at 
			the roof and the 
			birds)
		Can't they leave us alone?
			(shrieking it)
		LEAVE US ALONE!

	MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof 
	suddenly rips back.

	FULL SHOT - BIRDS

	from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof 
	tears back.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds, 
	and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around 
	Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	racing along as the birds hover over it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks 
	as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.

	FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR

	streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in 
	the road.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)

	It is arrow-straight, no curves.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins 
	to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds 
	attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into 
	them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They 
	are well ahead of the birds now.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		We're losing them.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	only a nod, his face streaming tears.

	LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)

	as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the 
	distance.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release 
	of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles 
	Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening, 
	looks ahead through the windshield.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR

	all their faces visible.

				CATHY
		Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll 
		be all right? In the trunk? Can they 
		breath?

				MITCH
			(with the faintest 
			smile)
		I think they'll be all right, honey.

	There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the 
	wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.  
	They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint 
	their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches 
	up to turn down the sun visor.

				MITCH
		It looks... it looks clear up ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise 
	over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the 
	distance it goes.

							 FADE OUT:

					 THE END
