DAWN OF
THE DEAD
(The working draft 1977)
by George A. Romero


1	We see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very
	quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to
	twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly
	and her expression grows more desperate.

	A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we
	can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually
	a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national
	emergency.

	The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the
	background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The
	woman sits up, snapping awake.

2	She lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is
	Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although
	she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and
	sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.

	She is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last
	several hours, covered by an old overcoat.

	Tony:	YOU OK?

	Fran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.

	Tony:	THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.

	The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to
	where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.
	We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They
	have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran
	looks about. She is still shaken from her dream.

3	We see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly.
	Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man
	monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing
	emotionally.

4	Voice:	WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL
			DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT
			HAPPEN.

	Voice:	YES, BUT THAT'S...

	Voice:	THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...

	Voice:	BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...

	Voice:	WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!
			WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW!

5	The room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others
	organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip
	over cables and generally get in each other's way.

6	Francine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head.

	Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.

	Fran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the
	floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened.

	Fran:	NO YOU'RE NOT.

	Woman:	MY TURN WITH THE COAT.

	Fran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper
	cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep.
	Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet.

	Woman:	THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.
			A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY.
			I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE
			TO STAY ON AIR.

7	Fran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are
	at the end of their ropes.

	Technicians: (all at once)
			WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA
			TWO, A BLIND MAN...
			WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME...
			ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN.

	Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE
			STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT.
			SO GET ME A NEW LIST.
			SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS.

	Fran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by
	the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness
	of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation.

8	We begin to listen over the din of the news room.

	TV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T
			BELIEVE...

	TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
			LIFE?

	TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO...

	TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO
			LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING?

	TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR!

9	Suddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it
	is being shot.

	TV Man 1:    (con't)
			ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US.
			AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE...

	TV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT...

	TV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU
			COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO
			FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND...

	TV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T...

	TV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY...

	TV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR.
			BERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE
			THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR!

	TV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN
			CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US
			WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER...

10	 A great cry of assent goes up from the studio floor. Doctor
	Foster is flustered and frustrated. The stage hands and
	cameramen are all screaming at him, swearing and ridiculing. We
	notice Police guards, armed, at the studio doors. They control
	the traffic in and out of the big room.

11	 Back at the control panel. Fran stares at the screens. Confusion
	still reigns.

	Man:	 FRANNIE, GET ON THE NEW LIST OF RESCUE STATIONS.
			CHARLIE'S RECEIVING ON THE EMERGENCIES...

	Fran pulls herself away from the monitors as the argument rages
	on screen.

12	 She fights through the heavy traffic and reaches Charlie, a
	harassed typist who holds the receiver of an emergency radio
	unit under his chin...

	Charlie:	(into receiver)
			SAY AGAIN...CAN'T HEAR YOU... 

	Fran:	RESCUE STATIONS?

	Fran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlie's desk. He writes
	notes as he listens on the receiver, and he speaks to the woman.

	Charlie:	HALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE.
			I'M TRYIN' TO FIND OUT AT LEAST ABOUT THE
			IMMEDIATE AREA. WE'VE HAD OLD INFORMATION
			ON THE AIR FOR THE LAST TWELVE HOURS.

	Fran:	THESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN'T SEND
			PEOPLE TO INOPERATIVE...

	Charlie:	(into receiver)
			SAY AGAIN, NEW HOPE...

	Charlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran. Still listening
	on the receiver, he speaks to the woman again.

	Charlie:	I'M DOIN' WHAT I CAN. THESE ARE DEFINITE
			AS OF NOW. SKIP AND DUSTY ARE ON THE RADIO,
			TOO. GOOD LUCK.

	Fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room.

13	 She stops at the consoles...

	Fran:	I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.
			I'LL HAVE THE NEW ONES READY AS SOON AS I CAN.

	Technician:  WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO PLACES THAT HAVE
			CLOSED DOWN. I'M GONNA KILL THE OLD LIST.

14	 Fran moves toward another control room. An armed officer stops
	her. A young man rushing through with copy intercedes.

	Man:	 HEY, SHE'S ALRIGHT.

	Officer:	WHERE'S YOUR BADGE?

	Fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse. Her
	badge is missing.

	Fran:	JESUS!

	Man:	 SHE'S ALRIGHT.

	Fran:	I HAD IT...I WAS ASLEEP OVER THERE...

	She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.

	Man:	 SOMEBODY STOLE IT. THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM
			MISSING.
			(to officer)
			SHE'S ALRIGHT. LET HER THROUGH.

	The officer reluctantly steps aside.

15	 The young man and Fan move down a crowded hall and into a small
	camera room. The foot traffic is solid. They talk as they walk.

	Fran:	I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

	Man:	 ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BADGES CAN OPEN A LOT
			OF DOORS...YOU AVOID A LOT OF HASSLES IF
			YOU GOT A BADGE...ANY KIND OF BADGE...

	Fran:	IT'S REALLY GOING CRAZY.

16	 They reach a small camera installation. The camera is aimed at a
	machine which rolls out a list of rescue stations. The list is
	superimposed over the live broadcast as it goes out.

	Cameraman:   YOU GOT NEW ONES?

	Fran:	I GOTTA TYPE 'EM UP. KILL THE OLD ONES.

	Cameraman:   GIVENS WANT 'EM...

	Fran:	KILL 'EM, DICK. TELL GIVENS TO SEE ME!

	The man clicks off his camera. Fran moves toward the studio.

17	 On the monitors, we see the rescue stations blink off over shots
	of the two men who still argue on the air.

	TV Man 1:    WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, DOCTOR.

	TV Man 2:    THESE ARE NOT GHOSTS. NOR ARE THESE HUMANS!
			THESE ARE DEAD CORPSES. ANY UN-BURIED HUMAN
			CORPSE WITH ITS BRAIN INTACT WILL IN FACT
			RE-ACTIVATE. AND IT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE OF
			INCITEMENT BY IRRESPONSIBLE PUBLIC FIGURES
			LIKE YOURSELF THAT THIS SITUATION IS BEING
			DEALT WITH IRRESPONSIBLY BY THE PUBLIC AT
			LARGE!

18	 Another outraged cry goes up from the stagehands and observers.
	Doctor Foster tries to out-scream the cries...

	TV Man 2:    YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED...
			FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS...WHAT DOES IT TAKE...
			WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE?

19	 Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters
	argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment.

20	 TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading)
			THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE
			MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT.
			IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS...
			WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE-
			ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN
			OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE
			BODY.

	Another outburst in the studio.

	TV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S
			TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY...

21	 Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and
	finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and
	Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes.

	Fran:	OPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS?

	Dusty:	THEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW.
			YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK
			WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR.

	Fran:	YEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY.
			WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES.

	She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men.

	Fran:	NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.

	The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes
	off toward a large teleprompter typing machine.

22	 The broadcasters still argue emotionally.

	TV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS,
			DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM.

	TV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED
			BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS!
			THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL!

23	 Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter
	typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room.

24	 Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even
	more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the
	station managers.

	Givens:	 NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT...

	Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room.

	Givens:	 GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?

	Fran:	NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.

	Givens:	 I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME.

	Fran:	ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM
			OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN?

	Givens:	 WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY
			MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT.

	Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief.

	Givens:	 I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT
			WE'RE ON THE AIR.

	Fran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one
	of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the
	control panel and starts to walk away.

	Givens:	 LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING...
			GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR!

	Lucas:	ANYBODY NEED A RIDE!

25	 Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up
	personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The
	door is guarded by a nervous Officer.

26	 Givens:	 OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE
			MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE...

	A frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People
	rush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a
	talk back system...

	Voices:	 WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE.
			SWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER...
			WE'RE LOSING PICTURE...

	Givens:	 OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN...
	 
27	 The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes
	a grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through.
	Then he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause.

28	 Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work
	the complex dials and pots...

	Givens:	 GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN
			THIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY
			FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE
			THE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR...

	Fran moves slowly off toward the studio.

29	 In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the
	newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions,
	but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over
	the broadcast which still rages.

30	 TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON.
			THEY KILL FOR FOOD.
			THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
			MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING.

31	 Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the
	shadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the
	studio in disgust.

32	 TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE
			PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION...
			WITHOUT...EMOTION...
			IT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS!

	Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his
	tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open.
	He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration.

	TV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN
			PHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN
			THE COUNTRY...
			CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE
			CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE
			BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD...
			BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE
			CITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF...
			MORALITY...
			IT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P. BY COMMAND OF THE
			FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
			UNITED STATES...
			CITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES,
			NO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED...

	A murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional
	crescendo. Foster tries to talk over the noise...

	TV Man 2:    CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF
			THE CITY...

33	 Technicians abandon their posts. A few others jump in to take
	their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his
	headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid
	head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster
	continues to speak.

	Fran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at
	the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not
	believing what she is seeing.

34	 TV Man 2:    THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WILL BE DELIVERED OVER
			TO SPECIALLY EQUIPPED SQUADS OF THE NATIONAL
			GUARD FOR ORGANISED DISPOSITION...

35	 Suddenly a man darts out of the bustling crowd and comes up
	quickly behind Fran.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF.
			WE'RE GETTING OUT.

	Fran:	(letting the camera slip slightly)
			STEPHEN...I DON'T BELIEVE THIS...WHAT...

	Steve:	WE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.

	Another technician steps over to take the camera from Fran.
	Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence.

	Steve:	NINE P.M. ALRIGHT?

	Fran:	STEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO...

	Steve:	WE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO
			SURVIVE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SURVIVE. NOW YOU
			COULD BE UP THERE AT NINE. DON'T MAKE ME COME
			LOOKIN' FOR YA.

	Stephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the
	cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman.
	The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder,
	speaks to Francine quietly and slowly.

	Cameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT
			ANYWAY. EMERGENCY NETWORKS ARE TAKING OVER.
			OUR RESPONSIBILITY... IS FINISHED, I'M AFRAID.

36	 It is dusk, and the city of Philadelphia is surprisingly quiet.
	We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income
	housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand
	like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky.

37	 Under cover of the growing darkness, activities of the S.W.A.T.
	Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around
	the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building.
	Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons,
	take position here and there about the development.

	Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court
	below.

38	 On the roof, at an entrance to one of the building's fire
	stairs, Roger squats silently alongside three other team
	members. The men check their weapons. Roger looks at his watch.
	The sweep hand reaches the 12...

	Roger:	(to himself) LIGHTS.

39	 In an instant, large searchlights bathe the side of the
	building. The troop commander, shielded with other Officers
	behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn.

	Commander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE
			HAVE THE BUILDING SURROUNDED...

	The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete
	caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a
	few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of
	the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time.

	Commander:   (not over the bullhorn)
			LITTLE BASTARD'S GOT 'EM ALL MOVED INTO ONE
			BUILDING...DUMB LITTLE BASTARD!

	Sergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.

	Commander:   (on the bullhorn again)
			MARTINEZ...THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROJECT ARE YOUR
			RESPONSIBILITY...WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM HURT
			AND NEITHER DO YOU!

42	 There is no sign of life in the building. The great concrete
	slab is silhouetted silently against the darkening sky.

43	 Roger, and his team mates, crouch in readiness. The sound of the
	bullhorn rises to them easily and clearly.

	Roger:	I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...

	Commander:   (Bullhorn)
			I'M GIVIN' YOU THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ...
			TURN OVER YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER...

	Roger:	THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU...

	Commander:   THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
			PEOPLE...

	Roger:	YET.

	Commander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ.

	Roger:	AND COUNTING.
			(he looks at his watch)

	There is a long silence.

	Roger:	COME ON, MARTINEZ!

	One of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a
	rough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened
	veteran, and a red neck of the first order.

	Wooley:	 YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY
			LITTLE PUERTO RICAN ASS...SO I CAN BLOW IT OFF...

	Roger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up
	violence in Wooley.

	Wooley:	 I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS..
			BLOW ALL THEIR LITTLE LOW LIFE PUERTO RICAN AND
			NIGGER ASSES RIGHT OFF...

	Roger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a
	young, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react.
	He is obviously nervous.

	Roger:	KEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE
			GO IN.

	The boy nods, grateful for a more human contact.

	Wooley:	 HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES
			IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT
			MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T
			GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW
			'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES!

	Roger:	(to the boy)
			YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT?

	The boy nods in the affirmative.

	Wooley:	 LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF
			MY TIME!

44	 CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts
	open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are
	fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the
	young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading
	expression on his face.

	Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other
	S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with
	his automatic weapon.

45	 On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into
	the bullhorn:

	Commander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN...
			GODDAMMIT!

	Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
			ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION!

46	 On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young
	man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.

	A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the
	rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large
	elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed
	down.

	Another bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back.
	Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in
	the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back
	off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles
	over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof
	top.

	Before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure
	of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The
	young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of
	bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of
	blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him.

	Wooley:	 COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS...
			COME AND GET 'EM...

	He fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding
	down.

	Roger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the
	cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian
	who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a
	break...

	Roger:	HOLD IT...

	The boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run
	across the roof.

	Roger:	HOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE!

	The boy is mowed down in a crossfire.

47	 Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of
	the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking
	into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where
	they are held at gun point.

	Some men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate
	against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on
	every floor of the complex structure.

48	 On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn:

	Commander:   MASKS...

	Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)
			MASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS.

49	 Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are
	filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are
	choked as they attempt to shoot their way out.

50	 The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the
	building.

	S.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME.
			HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM
			DOWN THE STAIRS.

	Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their
	bizarre looking gas masks.

51	 The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple
	kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and
	their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband
	surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group
	is led into the hallway.

	Suddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the
	apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to
	stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his
	automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed.
	He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly
	into the room.

	The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the
	hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people
	kneel or fall against the walls praying.

	S.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN...

	Roger:	WOOLEY! (shouting)

	Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at
	him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His
	gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger,
	but Roger manages to hold on.

	Roger:	GIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY...

	Another S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is
	very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a
	deep voice.

	Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM.

	Roger:	GIMME A HAND.

	Wooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall,
	but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling
	off his gun at the open apartment door.

	Roger:	GODDAMMIT...HELP ME...HE'S CRAZY!

	Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM!

	Just then, Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the
	hallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one
	shot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently.

	The mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall.
	Other S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at
	them through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through
	the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the
	civilians.

	Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped
	to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and
	staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are
	locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment
	which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes
	widen as well.

53	 In the apartment, lying in a pool of blood, are the partial
	remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.

	Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves
	inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm
	badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers.

54	 A sudden loud scream. Roger startles and spins around. A woman
	in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming
	down the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the
	Troopers who try to hold them back.

55	 The Trooper in the apartment is revulsed...

	Trooper:	JESUS...HOLY JESUS...

	A third officer enters the apartment. He speaks to the Trooper
	which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.

	Trooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD.

	The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third
	Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the
	shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer,
	flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman.
	There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of
	the walking dead.

	The Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the
	room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the
	Trooper.

	Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A
	male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles
	with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels
	something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his
	ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to
	pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and
	lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its
	hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot
	free his pistol.

	Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the
	woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back
	immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires.
	A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her
	onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes.

	The boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires
	at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's
	skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking
	violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He
	fires again...and again...and again.

56	 In the hall, the male Zombie appears, and the crowd panics. The
	Troopers try to keep things calm.

	S.W.A.T. 3:  IT'S ONE OF THEM...MY GOD...IT'S ONE OF THEM.

	S.W.A.T. 4:  SHOOT FOR THE HEAD.

	Woman:	NO! NO! MIGUEL...DIOS MIO...MIGUELITO...

	The woman pushes through the crowd. The Zombies advances. Before
	the Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the
	creature.

	Woman:	MIGUEL...MI VIDA...MIGUELITO...

	S.W.A.T. 3:  GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...
			(his gun is levelled off, but he can't get a shot)

	The Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck...her
	arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the
	creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from
	behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper
	grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming
	insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm.

	S.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR!

57	 In the apartment, the female Zombie lunges at the third Trooper
	and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and,
	with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances
	again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He
	fires. The bullet drops her.

58	 In the hall, a Trooper brings his gun butt slamming against the
	male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming
	woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the
	floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's
	shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through
	the skull. It falls.

59	 There is finally a calm. A few of the citizens murmur prayers.
	Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the
	clouds of gas in a totally dazed state.

60	 Roger and the third Trooper from the apartment drift to the
	hallway. The third Trooper moves into the crowd, but Roger
	stands against the open door jamb for a moment.

	A sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He
	looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself
	through the head.

61	 In the dark firestair, it is very quiet. Roger bursts through a
	metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair
	railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself.
	He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which
	still clings in the air.

	Voice:	YOU'RE NOT ALONE BROTHER.

	Roger tightens, grabbing for his gun. The voice is present; very
	nearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the
	Trooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger.

	Voice:	YOU WAS IN WOOLEY'S UNIT.

	Roger:	I DIDN'T SEE NOTHIN.
			I DIDN'T SEE HOW HE DIED.

	Roger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his
	gun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black.

	Roger:	YOU RUNNIN?

	The Black man shrugs. He hasn't decided.

	Roger:	I DON'T JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF WOOLEY.
			I JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF...

	Voice:	YEAH. I KNOW.

	Roger:	THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN'.
			I COULD RUN.

	Roger stares up at the grim faced Black.

	Roger:	I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT.

	The black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes.

	Roger:	FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES
			TRAFFIC FOR J.A.S. GOT A HELICOPTER AND HE'S
			RUNNIN' OUT WITH IT. AS'T ME T'COME.

	The Black man smiles.

	Roger:	YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN?

	The Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the
	stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down
	into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows.

62	 A few landings down...a noise. The two Troopers freeze. The
	stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready
	their weapons.

	The sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls
	of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There
	is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.

	The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward
	slightly, trying not to make a sound.

	Suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against
	the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls
	away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly...
	robed...in black...is sees the Troopers...

	Figure:	 SENORES...
			PLEASE TO LET ME PASS...

	The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps
	and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old
	Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.

	Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his
	breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at
	his chest.

	Roger tries to support him.

	Roger:	LET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS...

	Priest:	 NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET
			ME PASS...MY SISTER...I GO UP TO SEVEN
			FLOOR...TO FIND MY SISTER...

	Roger:	THEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY
			BROUGHT HER DOWN...COME ONE...

	Priest:	 MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME...
			THE DEAD THEY DO NOT BRING DOWN.

	Roger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.

	Priest:	 JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD.
			THE PEOPLE OF 107 WILL DO WHAT YOU
			WISH NOW. THESE SIMPLE PEOPLE...
			BUT STRONG...THEY HAVE LITTLE...BUT THEY
			DO NOT GIVE IT UP EASILY. AND THEY GIVE
			UP THEIR DEAD...TO NO ONE!

	The Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger
	wants to help in some way.

	Priest:	 MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST
			WEEKS...IN THE BASEMENT OF THIS BUILDING
			YOU FIND THEM...

	The Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet.

	Priest:	 I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES.
			NOW...YOU DO WHAT YOU WILL...

	The old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but
	the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the
	gas mist, coughing.

	Priest:	 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I
			THINK...THEY BE STRONGER THAN YOU...

	The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears
	in the cloud...

	Priest:	 WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST
			STOP THE KILLING...OR WE LOSE THE WAR...

63	 In the basement of the large building, S.W.A.T. troopers pry at
	the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage
	area.

	The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons
	raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers...

	The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are
	silent, not knowing what to expect.

	There are three boards left...then two...

	With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men
	remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips
	off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies
	pushes into the hall.

	They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly
	Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They
	are all ages, from the very old to the very young.

	The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough,
	and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is
	impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring
	other troopers.

	The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the
	front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear
	into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.

	Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT...

	The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass
	of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some
	Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate
	rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by
	clutching ghouls.

	Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle.
	They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into
	little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly
	organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless
	onslaught.

64	 As the main action moves away from the entrance to the storage
	area, several Troopers move into the room.

	The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All
	around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and
	bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and
	cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

	And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of
	corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still
	moving, their heads uninjured.

	Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire
	and screaming can be heard from the hall.

	The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him.
	He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires
	carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears
	roll down his cheeks.

	Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been
	eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a
	gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move.

	A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one
	arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his
	pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches
	for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls
	closer, its mouth wide.

	Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the
	creatures head with his automatic rifle.

	The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load
	the pistol.

	Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place
	where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe
	about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are
	eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never
	look up. They don't seem to notice him at all.

	A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up.

65	 In the ceiling, a double set of loading doors has been opened.
	Several other Troopers look down into the storage area.

	Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

	He shines a light beam down towards Roger.

	Trooper:	YOU OK DOWN THERE?

64	 Roger nods.

65	 Trooper:	THIS MUST BE WHERE THEY DUMPED 'EM IN.

64	 Roger looks down at the pile of corpses beneath the opening.

65	 Trooper:	YOU NEED MORE MEN?

64	 Roger shakes his head "no".

65	 Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

	The trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who
	just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round
	lenses of their masks.

66	 The distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. The
	big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a
	few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and
	tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is
	writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.

	Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also
	writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet
	should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks
	around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man
	fires into the thing's head.

	Roger:	THEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER...

	Black:	JUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE...

	Roger:	WHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY
			DON'T THEY TURN THEM OVER...OR...OR DESTROY
			THEM THEMSELVES...IT'S INSANE...WHY DO THEY
			DO IT?

	Black:	'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S
			RESPECT IN DYING.

	The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie.

67	 In the halls of the building, Troopers fall and are pounced on
	by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the
	heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay
	organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it
	is turning into a riot.

68A	The buildings of Philadelphia loom in the moonlight. What few
	lights remain lit reflect in the waters of the Delaware.

68B	It is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an
	occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one
	another.

	There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina.
	They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted
	the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF
	PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken
	chain in the wind.

	Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside,
	sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed
	guard.

	Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large
	square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters.
	Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a
	small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper
	and launches.

	The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another
	officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we
	begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter.

	The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down
	for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the
	gently bobbing heliport.

69	 With the blades still spinning loudly, Stephen hops out of the
	cockpit.

	Steve:	COME ON...I NEED YOU.

	Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of
	the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the
	woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for
	the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	I DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES.

	Fran:	OH MY GOD!

70	 The woman freezes in mid stride, and her action brings Stephen's
	eyes around to see what she is staring at. The two bodies which
	lie near the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL.
			IT'S TOUGH TO GET USED TO IT.

	He pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the
	civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to
	walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the
	tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back
	to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian
	corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has
	been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood
	still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he
	tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with
	Fran following.

71	 At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead,
	Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He
	pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism.

	Steve:	JUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR...

	Fran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger.

	Steve:	THAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE
			SPITS OUT AT YA.

	The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard
	shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie,
	whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the
	lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks.
	She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

72	 At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio
	operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code.
	The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send
	key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the
	dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect
	posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all
	but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still
	running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the
	desk and the radio unit.

	Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send
	a message in Morse:

			OPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED...

73	 Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian
	corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence
	other than Fran's.

74	 The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still
	whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She
	looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching
	vehicle can be seen.

75	 At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine,
	steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran.

	Steve:	I HOPE IT'S ROGER.

76	 Fran:	WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

	Steve:	I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

77	 He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and
	throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He
	finds a toolbox.

	As he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the
	shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back.
	Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed
	officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of
	the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked
	and aimed.

78	 Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but
	suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.
	Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a
	Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide
	open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors
	move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The
	figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It
	rushes toward the launch docks.

	Voice:	JUST STAY COOL.

	Fran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly
	shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel
	nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock
	boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle
	directly at her head.

	Officer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT.

	The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the
	Guard House.

	Officer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'.

79	 In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers
	while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the
	progress of the approaching vehicles.

	Officer 3:   WHO ARE YOU?

	Steve:	WE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE...

	Officer 4:   (at the door)
			ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.
			(referring to the arrival time of the vehicle)

	Officer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve
	spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and
	sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is
	almost a mile long.

80	 Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the
	helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle.

81	 Steve:	NOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL...
			THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE...
			YOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS
			AFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH...

	Officer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter)
			HEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH...
			STEVE ANDREWS.

	Steve:	(trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power)
			RIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW...

	Officer 3:   NO SHIT.

82	 Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter)
			WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER.

83	 Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers.

84	 The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the
	dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches.

	Officer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT.

85	 Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen)
			HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD?

	Officer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I
			CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF!

86	 Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another
	carton rushing back to the launch.

	Officer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND
			WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH!

	Officer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD!

87	 Suddenly, above the two white headlights of the approaching
	vehicle, we see a third light in red. It is the spinning
	"bubble-gum-machine" of a Squad Car. It is heralded by one
	blast of the car's siren.

88	 Officer 4:   HEY, THAT'S A BLACK AND WHITE!

89	 Officer 1 still holds his rifle aimed at Fran.

	Officer 1:   THEY SEEN US!

90	 Officer 3:   IT'S ALRIGHT...WE'RE POLICE...

91	 Officer 2 dumps his carton at the edge of the dock and pulls one
	rifle from his back.

	Officer 2:   BULL SHIT...LET'S GET TO THE BOAT!

92	 Officer 3 stares hard at Stephen. Then at the Squad Car. Then
	back at the nervous young pilot.

	Officer 3:   YOU'RE RUNNIN', AIN'T YOU, FLY BOY?

	Steve does not respond. He is terrified, not knowing what answer
	to be the safest.

	Officer 3:   YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IS RUNNIN' OFF IN THE
			J.A.S. TRAFFIC BIRD...

	The man starts to grin with knowing. He suddenly feels in more
	control.

	Officer 3: SIT TIGHT, BOYS...THEY'RE RUNIN', TOO.

93	 It seems to take forever for the Police Car to pull down the
	dock. Stephen takes a few steps forward, squinting to see, but
	he is threatened by the "Policeman's" gun barrels.

94	 The car screeches to a stop and two armed S.W.A.T. Troopers
	immediately pop out of the front seat on either side. They are
	Roger and the Black Trooper.

	Roger:	WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER?

95	 Officer 3:   CAUGHT YOUR FRIENDS HERE STEALIN' COMPANY
			GASOLINE.

96	 Roger:	WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?

	Roger is trying to play dumb, assuming that the other Policemen
	are on official business...

97	 Steve:	THEY KNOW, ROG...
			THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET OUT, TOO.

	Officer 3:   IT'D BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN' AT ONE
			ANOTHER, NOW WOULDN'T IT?

98	 Roger:	SURE WOULD.

99	 Officer 1:   ALRIGHT, LET'S LOAD UP...

	He slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran. She
	bobbles it and it falls, skittering across the dock.

	Officer 1:   YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING, WOMAN.
			TIMES IS TENSE.

100	The policemen start to unload crates and cartons from their Van.
	The big Black Trooper pulls a few supplies from out of the squad
	car and carries them toward the helicopter.

101	Fran trots over toward Stephen. He is just coming back out of
	the guardhouse where he picked up the toolbox and the knapsack
	full of supplies. The woman falls into his arms. Roger trots up.

	Roger:	YOU OK?

	Stephen:	(nods)
			WHO'S HE?
			(referring to the big Black)

	Roger:	HIS NAME'S PETER. HE'S ALRIGHT.

	The three are already moving toward the helicopter.

	Roger:	LET'S HUSTLE.

102	Peter has stowed the supplies in the rear of the cockpit, and he
	has noticed the fuel hose lying on the dock. He tries the nozzle
	in the receptacle on the chopper and holds it in until the tank
	fills.

103	The other "Policemen" are still moving cartons of supplies from
	their van down the dock.

	Roger:	(to the other Policemen)
			YOU GUYS BETTER MOVE IT. THERE'S A RADIO
			REPORT ABOUT THE DOCK BEIN' KNOCKED OUT.

104	They reach the cockpit. Fran climbs in and crouches on the floor
	in the rear of the bubble.

	Fran:	YOU SURE THIS'LL CARRY US ALL.

	Steve:	LITTLE HARDER ON THE FUEL, BUT WE'LL BE OK.

105	As Peter climbs aboard, one of the other policemen, carrying a
	final carton, speaks to Roger.

	Officer 2:   HEY...YOU GOT ANY CIGARETTES.

	Roger looks at the others one at a time. Fran shakes her head
	"no".

	Roger:	SORRY. (he trots around to the passenger seat)

	Steve:	WHERE YA HEADED?

	Officer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO
			THE ISLANDS.

	Steve:	WHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine)

	Officer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED?

	Steve:	STRAIGHT UP.

106	The Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one
	of the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines
	loudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion.

	The Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out
	onto the dark river.

107	The lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low
	over the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city.
	Independence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original
	American flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in
	the night. The whirring engine fades overhead.

108	In the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one
	comments, but Peter smiles slightly.

	The big Black looks down at the city.

	Peter:	ANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND?

	Fran:	AN EX-HUSBAND.

	Roger:	AN EX-WIFE.

	Steve:	YOU PETER?

	Peter:	(still looking down)
			SOME BROTHERS.

109	The whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over
	open country now, moving West. Some time has passed.

110	Roger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped
	rear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each
	other. Peter still stares off into the night.

	Fran:	REAL BROTHERS?

	Peter looks at her. He has a strong face.

	Fran:	REAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS?

	Peter:	BOTH.

	Fran:	HOW MANY REAL ONES?

	Peter:	TWO.

	Fran:	TWO.

	Peter:	ONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER.
			BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE.

	Fran doesn't quite know how to respond.

	Peter:	(nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly
			for the pilot to hear the conversation)
			HE YOUR MAN NOW?

	Fran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly.

	Fran:	MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.

	Peter:	JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS.

	Fran:	YEAH. ME TOO.

111	Light downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through
	the shades of blue.

112	Now Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the
	back of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes
	himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him
	in the shoulder.

	Steve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter
	just stares at him.

	Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at
	his lower eyelids.

	Steve:	ANY MORE WATER?

	Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container
	with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his
	face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks.

	Suddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks
	over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to
	orient herself.

	Peter:	(to Stephen)
			YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

	Steve:	I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.

	Peter:	HARRISBURG?

	Steve:	PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

	Roger finally wakes up from the loud talking.

	Steve:	WE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN'
			FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE
			LANDIN' IN.

113	In the morning light, several fires can be seen on the ground,
	where buildings are burning.

114	The chopper flies over a National Guard convoy as it chugs up a
	winding country road.

115	Here and there on the ground, human activity can be seen. Search
	and Destroy units, made up of Police, Guardsmen and civilian
	volunteers move across the country side. Occasionally, a Zombie
	is seen staggering through the trees or over a field. Gunfire
	cuts the creature down.

116	Roger:	JESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE.

	Steve:	WE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE
			BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES.

117	A little country airfield lies quiet in the morning sun. There
	is no sign of life. A few private planes dot the area, but the
	tower is empty. The J.A.S. chopper buzzes very low just outside
	the tower windows.

118	As the whirlybird slowly sets down near the fuel pumps, its
	blades create a wind blast which raises great clouds of dust
	from the dry earth. Sheets of old newspaper and other light
	debris are sent flying through the air in all directions.

119	One piece of torn newsprint blows flat against a window in one
	of the little sheds.  It sticks against the glass for a moment,
	as though glued there, then it flutters to the ground. As the
	paper clears the glass, we see the face of a badly scarred
	Zombie peering out through the window.

120	As the group scrambles out of the helicopter, Stephen
	immediately checks the fuel pumps.

	Steve:	SHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY.

	Roger:	LOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS.
			GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF.

	Steve:	TO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?

	Peter:	WHERE WE GOIN?

	By now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the
	chopper's tank, and moved to the second pump. It spurts with
	more force.

	Steve:	THERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP.

	He stretches the hose toward the chopper but it doesn't quite
	reach.

	Steve:	DAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER.

121	Steve jumps back into the cockpit and the machine lifts off the
	ground.

122	Fran is watching the action, walking slowly backwards to a small
	rickety hangar area. She turns and looks down to the private
	hangars. Most of them are open wide, the planes they housed long
	gone. One or two of the old wooden double-doors are still closed
	and locked with chains and padlocks. The wind from the chopper
	blades blows her hair and sends more debris flying.

123	Peter kicks open the door to the chart house. The room is dusty
	and dilapidated. A few small chairs surround an old wooden
	table. Several half finished cups of coffee sit on top of
	wrinkled flight charts leaving brown rings on the paper. Flies
	buzz loudly. An old window shade clicks against its window from
	the gusting of the wind and it makes Peter flinch.

	He readies his weapon. When he sees the shade, he steps over to
	it easily, pulls it and lets it roll up on itself. It makes a
	loud, flapping noise.	

124	Outside, the chopper sets down. Roger is ready with the hose
	nozzle. Ducking under the blades he inserts the device into the
	tank receptacle even before Stephen has idled the engine.

	Stephen hops out of the cockpit and shouts over the engine
	noise.

	Steve:	I'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS.

	He trots off after Fran.

125	In the chart house, Peter idly drops a coin into an old coffee
	machine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and
	spits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill
	with hot brown liquid.

	While he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the
	machine and the surrounding walls. They are all written
	hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and 
	colours.

			LUCY - GONE TO JOHNSTOWN.
			CHARLES - I HAVE THE KIDS. LEFT WITH BEN.
			COULDN'T WAIT. GONE TO ERIE - JACK FOSTER.

	There are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee
	cup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet
	door just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked,
	but it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly
	than if caused by the wind drafts.

	Peter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud
	crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table
	and takes his rifle in both hands.

	Again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of
	the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and
	Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out
	of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum.

	Another bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is
	trying to break out of the closet.

	Quite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door
	about head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a
	splintery hole appears in the old wooden door.

126	Outside, Fran and Stephen snap to attention at the sound of the
	rifle. Fran stands at the entrance to one of the little wooden
	hangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna
	inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As
	they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they
	are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them
	through the dust cloud from the chopper.

	Fran screams. They have no weapons with them.

	Steve:	ROGER...ROGER...

127	Under the whirling chopper blades, Roger continues to fill the
	fuel tank. In the roar of the engine, he cannot hear anything
	else.

	A third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is
	to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger.

128	Inside the chart house. Peter stares at the closet door. It is
	still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again.

	Peter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first
	forming a triangle.

129	The two creatures advance slowly on Fran and Steve.

	Steve:	JUST RUN.

	Fran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are
	boxed in by the hangars.

	Steve:	RUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM.
			THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.

	She hesitates. The Zombies draw closer.

	Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
			WE CAN HANDLE THEM!

	Fran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the
	creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As
	she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in
	fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is
	within a few feet of the woman.

	Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!

	Fran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She
	is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just
	gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and
	looks back, stopping again.

	One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The
	other continues to advance on Stephen.

130	Stephen ducks back into the open hangar. It is very dark but for
	thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden
	boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy
	tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge
	hammer. He runs out of the shed.

131	He dodges around the lead Zombie, who staggers on with inertia.
	Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The
	man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the
	grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he
	brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming
	against the ghoul's skull with all his might.

	The creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody
	pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in
	the dust.

	Without breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two
	run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has
	turned around and is walking up the grade.

132	Roger is pumping the last drops out of the fuel hose when he
	sees the frightened couple making for the chopper.

133	As Steve charges up the grade he sees the Zombie approaching
	Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The
	stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its
	hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the
	ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't
	have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun
	holster.

	Suddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of
	its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature
	has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers
	forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.

134	Stephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the
	woman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He
	lunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in
	the propeller draft.

135	The Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars
	almost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and
	advances steadily toward the helicopter.

136	The shot misses clean. He fires again. The bullet grazes the
	creature's face. It staggers from the impact, but does not fall.

137	Roger moves quickly for his high powered weapon. Steve fires
	two more rounds.

138	Another miss and another graze, this time on the arm.

139	He is about to shoot once more when Roger stops him, stepping up
	alongside.

	Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the
	creatures' brain.

140	The Zombie falls and papers blow over its body.

141	In the chart house. Peter fires several more shots into the
	closet door. Bullet holes appear just where the creature's head
	should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have
	missed.

	Silence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high.

	Then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the
	room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the
	other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are
	dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least
	a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door.

	Peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled
	that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The
	moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival
	instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and
	thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is
	about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small
	Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces
	on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes
	against its brother.

	Now Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to
	their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession.
	First one creature falls; then the other.

	Peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and
	disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition.

	Peter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses.
	Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even
	looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door
	of the chart house.


142	Behind him, in the brightly sunlit doorway, we see the Zombie
	who first appeared at the window. The creature staggers forward.
	Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs
	away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun.
	The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room.

	Peter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the
	sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears
	with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder.

143	Steve raises his gun and aims at the Zombie, but the barrel
	seems to be on a straight line with Peter.

144	Peter ducks quickly. Steve's gun fires. The bullet misses the
	creature cleanly and crashes into the room. It ricochets off
	the coffee machine. Another shot crashes through the glass in
	the front room.

	Peter crouches, still stuffing shells into his weapon. A third
	of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but
	the creature still stands. It turns toward Peter slowly. Peter
	crawls under the table as another shot splatters into the coffee
	cups.

145	Once again, Roger steps up beside Stephen.  He fires one
	carefully aimed shot, looking through his telescopic range-
	finder.

146	Just as Peter finishes loading his weapon, the Zombie crashes
	into the room, falling over the table and onto the floor.

147	Fran is still kneeling in the dust, trying to keep herself from
	vomiting. Stephen rushes to her side. Roger, keeping his rifle
	poised, shouts toward the chart house.

	Roger:	PETER.

148	The big Black man appears in the doorway, snapping the safety on
	his rifle.

151	Fran's retching causes her to choke and cough. Steve tries to
	comfort her, not knowing what to say and shaking himself.

152	Peter advances with long strides.

153	Stephen looks up when the Black man is a dozen steps away.
	Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper
	then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to
	stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an
	instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle
	aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead.

	Fran screams through her choking...

	Fran:	NO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

	Peter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones.

	Peter:	YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER.
			IT'S SCARY.
			ISN'T IT?
			ISN'T IT?

	Stephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers
	his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his
	feet.

154	Roger clears the fuel hose from around the runners of the
	chopper. Peter climbs into the cockpit and sits in the rear
	without saying another word.

	Roger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of
	the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger
	climbs in behind Fran as she squeezes into the uncomfortable
	space beside Peter. The big black offers the woman a sip of
	water, which she accepts. Then she lets her head flop wearily
	against the rear bulkhead.

155	Steve is urgently surveying his flight charts, shuffling the
	papers and trying to seem very busy after the embarrassment of
	the incident.

	Steve:	WE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH.

	Roger:	NO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES.
			IT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER
			GET OUT ALIVE.

	Peter:	WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE.
			WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE.

	Roger:	WE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE.
			AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE
			THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY.

	Peter:	YEAH, WELL IT WASN'T "THOSE THINGS" THAT
			NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY!

	Stephen turns around and is about to say something angrily.
	Roger stops him by speaking urgently.

	Roger:	WE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO
			BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.

	Steve:	(reluctantly going back to his charts)
			THERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY.
			FUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE.

	Roger:	PROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE
			HASSLES EITHER.

	Steve:	THEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS...

	Peter:	OH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE?

	Steve:	(angrily)
			I GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN.

	Peter	RIGHT. AND WE'RE OUT HERE DOIN' TRAFFIC REPORTS?
			WAKE UP, SUCKER. WE'RE THIEVES AND BAD GUYS IS
			WHAT WE ARE. AND WE GOTTA FIND OUR OWN WAY!

	There is a long silence. The engine drones, but the helicopter
	still sits on the ground. The men look at each other. Peter
	takes a long slug of water.

	Fran:	JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE
			GOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING
			OUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN,
			YOU NEED TO SLEEP.

156	We see a wide shot of the little airfield. The J.A.S. chopper
	sits on the ground for a moment, it's props spinning. The, with
	a surge of power, it lifts off and flies away. The dry earth
	swirls up into clouds and blows more bits of paper over the
	wide-eyed corpses which lie in the morning sunlight.

157	We see the facade of an enormous structure. It is a huge,
	suburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and
	their clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The
	building looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground.
	There are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed
	within have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot.

158	In the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are
	painted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area
	are parked randomly, some with their doors open wide.

159	We hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we
	see the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the
	roof of the building.

160	In the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see
	several of the living dead.  They look almost like normal
	shoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering	walk is unmistakably stiff.
161	At one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked
	by several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and
	surrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to	negotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce
	off windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One
	creature walks around in the revolving door endlessly.

	There are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out
	and far between. They move with no seeming purpose.
	We do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no	attention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.

162	On the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,
	the humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They
	look down at the creatures which dot the parking lot.

	Fran:	OH MY GOD!

	Stephen:	NO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
	Roger:	WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T			GET UP HERE.
	Steve:	YEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE!

	Roger:	LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
	Roger trots away.
163	Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of
	transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He
	stares through one of them and can see into the mall below.
	Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.
	Peter:	MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK			THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164	The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,
	a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent
	bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which
	is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can
	be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy
	metal cage gates down and locked into position.
	One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter
	the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.

	Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings
	the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-
	gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead
	creatures are evident on the balcony.

165	Fran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles.

	Roger:	I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND
			FLOOR.

	Peter:	THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH
			FLOORS.

	Roger:	IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP...

166	Peter is looking across the rest of the expansive rooftop. He
	takes off toward a series of other housings which jut up out of
	the otherwise flat surface. Roger follows.

167	Fran:	(still staring down through a bubble)
			WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
			WHY DO THEY COME HERE?

	Steve:	(also looking down)
			SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY
			USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN
			THEIR LIVES.

168	Below, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the
	plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out
	of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an
	appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly
	behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the
	floor loudly.

169	We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an
	intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of
	the roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large
	power generator.

170	Peter:	SOLAR SCREENS.

	Roger:	CAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE.

	Peter:	EMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE.

	Roger:	IT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE.

	Peter:	GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA.
			A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR.

171	Roger:	HEY LOOK AT THIS!

	Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are
	several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves
	to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and
	Stephen jog up.

	Roger:	THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL.
			WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

	Fran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a
	flashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform
	all the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his
	ammunition belt and pistol holster.

172	The big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor
	is only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely
	nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey.

	Peter:	DAMN.

173	Roger has moved to another window.

	Roger:	HEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE.

174	Peter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast
	array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them.

	Roger:	STORAGE?

175	Peter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of
	large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the
	line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol
	of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.

176	Peter:	CIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY.

	Roger:	AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!

	Steve:	HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?

	Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a
	hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle
	butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to
	the floor below.

177	Inside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for
	rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights.
	We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it
	is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of
	Civil Defence supplies.

178	Suddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on
	its feet in the sunray. It is Peter.	Instantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across
	the large room. Silence.

	Peter:	OK.

	He steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the
	floor.179	The two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food
	cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes
	quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.	In a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It
	creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window
	above.

180	Now Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down
	the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an
	anxious Stephen.181	Peter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the
	enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to
	one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.	Peter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man
	gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his
	rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a
	sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and
	ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all
	but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger.

182	The door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the
	people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies.

	The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The
	room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through
	skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but
	for the one Peter opened.
	Roger:	DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183	In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the
	cartons.

	Fran:	SPAM!

	Roger walks back into the room.
	Roger:	YOU BRING A CAN OPENER?

	Fran:	OH.

	Roger:	THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.

	The woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little
	key.

	Peter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly
	toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room.
	Again, Roger follows.

184	At the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T.
	procedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small
	space. Again no immediate danger.

185	As the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing
	of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the
	air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling,
	but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and
	there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into
	blackness.

	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK?

	The Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then
	back into the storage area.

	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK?
			CUT.

186	A great barricade of food cartons has been stacked against the
	stairway door.

187	Near the pyramid under the open skylight, the group of refugees
	sits on the floor.

	Stephen is asleep. Fran sits next to his curled form, her hand
	in his hair. Roger leans against the pyramid and Peter sits in
	the lotus position, his gun across his legs, squarely facing the
	suspicious stairwell. He and Roger still pick at their food.
	Roger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled
	from one of the C.D. drums.

	Roger:	YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO, BUDDY.

	Peter:	THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT
			WE COULD USE, BROTHER.

	Roger:	I KNOW IT.

	Fran stiffens at the talk.  She doesn't believe what she is	hearing. She knows instantly that the men will try to raid the
	mall.	Peter:	THEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE.
			IT'S A BIG PLACE. I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM.

	Roger:	HIT AND RUN.

	Peter:	HIT AND RUN... MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO...

	Fran:	YOU'RE CRAZY!	Roger:	THIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE.
			WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.

188	Roger checks his weaponry and quickly moves toward the door
	where he begins to remove the barricade of cartons. Peter still
	sits, checking his own guns.

189	Fran:	THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY
			FROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT...

	Peter:	THE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS!
			WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...(the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through
				it all)

	Peter:	(standing)
			LEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES.

	The big Trooper bends over snatching up Stephen's rifle. He
	snaps off the safety and slams a shell into the chamber. He
	hands it to the woman.	Peter:	THAT'S READY TO SHOOT. BE CAREFUL.
	Fran holds the gun gingerly.	Peter:	THE TRIGGER SQUEEZES REAL EASY, BUT THE WEAPON'LL
			KICK YOU GOOD WHEN IT FIRES. BE READY FOR THAT.

	Fran	 WAIT A MINUTE, I...

	Peter:	ANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS, YOU GUYS
			TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT
			OUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE.

	Fran just stares up at the big man, with desperation in her
	eyes. She has stopped arguing seeing that the Troopers'
	decision is made.

	Peter:	IF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES...
			WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.			YOU UNDERSTAND?190	In the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls
	open suddenly. The stairway is still empty.	The Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down
	into the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down
	the steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the
	doorway clutching the rifle.	Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened
	woman.	Peter:	YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.			JUST DON'T PANIC, OK.

	Fran sighs exhaustedly.

	Peter:	YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN
			THE FIRE.

191	Two landings below, there is almost no light. Roger clicks on
	his flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small
	concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one
	door. Peter eases down the steps behind.	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192	We see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another
	cement walled space, which also seems small from our angle, but
	it is fully lit.	The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As
	the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of
	a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open
	supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.
	Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193	Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some
	doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there
	is nothing.	The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out
	onto the second story of the mall proper.194	The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.
	They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is
	wide open.
195	Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is
	a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are
	fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196	The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter	swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is
	a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.
	There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one
	wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling
	over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of
	the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and
	an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code
	to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.	On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal
	cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual
	and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and
	there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,
	also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings
	and Roger steps up behind him.	Roger:	THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197	Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and	throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,
	obviously the executive headquarters.	The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door
	in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting
	Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,
	with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198	The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and
	corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the
	interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199	Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move
	into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the
	hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They
	can only see a small section.200	The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop
	down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see
	the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can
	be seen. They are both gated and shut.
201	The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper.
	They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to
	opposite walls in the corridor.202	As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer
	around their respective corners.

203	The upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the
	building, and at several points bridges across from one side to
	the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length
	of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches
	for a large department store.	Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big
	department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall
	trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of
	the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on
	the balcony.204	The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The
	crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the
	sight is even more spectacular.205	Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.	Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio
	and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods
	and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record
	Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift
	Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.
	And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each
	end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department
	Stores; great symbols of a consumer society.
	Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and
	park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist
	another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where
	mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants
	and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling
	everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.
	There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now
	still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable
	displays futuristic household appliances.	The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they
	appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and
	Customs of a civilisation now gone.

	The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the
	mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of
	the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from
	the Troopers' perspective.

206	Roger:	IT'S CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE, BUDDY.
	Peter:	FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.	Roger:	WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.			THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.

	Peter:	LET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.

207	The Troopers stealthily pull away from the railing and back into
	the administrative corridor. Then they move quickly down the
	hall toward the Maintenance Office.

208	As the men leave the balcony, the camera pans. Several yards
	away a Zombie staggers out of one of the open stores. It is
	followed by a second creature, a female without one arm. They	are moving along the balcony toward the open corridor.

209	In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers are checking the keys
	against the coded map on the wall.

	Roger:	SEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...

	The men check the keys. Peter finds corresponding numbers.

	Peter:	HERE.
	Roger:	LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.	Peter:	LOOK HERE (on the map) THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL
			BE LOCKS (he points) FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE,
			MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE?

	The man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within
	the big Department Store they are studying.	Roger:	WASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO.	Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still
	stares at the map.	Peter:	I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES.
	Roger:	HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?
	Peter:	WHAT?210	The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls
	on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch
	which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS
	and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens
	of master switches which are in the off mode.
	Peter:	POWER SWITCHES.
	Roger:	THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.	Peter:	HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN			EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.

	Roger hits the switches one at a time.

211	Throughout the mall, we hear the drone of the dull, mass
	produced music designed to lull a shopper's brain.212	Upstairs, Francine startles at the sound from below. She snaps
	the rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing
	just inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and
	looks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music
	drift up to her. She leans into the storage area again.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...
			STEPHEN!

213	Steve, still lying on the floor against the escape pyramid,
	slowly awakens.214	Down on the first floor of the big mall, things begin to work.
	The automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators
	move up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting
	up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical
	steps begin moving.

	Lights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays
	begin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming
	alive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in
	confusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving
	exhibits.215	In a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the
	way to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within
	begin to flutter and squawk.216	In a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window
	display. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at
	the noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217	On one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It
	is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate
	Developer's new tract of suburban houses. A narrator speaks in a
	friendly voice:
			... and for prices which anyone can afford,			you can live in these luxurious new homes
			by Brandon. Fully electric, central air, ..etc.

218	In the Maintenance Office, the Troopers ready themselves for
	their raid. Peter secures the vital key ring to his utility	belt and the move out.

	Peter and Roger move down the Hall and exit through door to
	exterior corridor.

219	Just as Roger moves through the door into the corridor, he is
	confronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and
	ducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out
	with clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots
	cleanly through the creature's head.220	As the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of
	the firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman.

	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST...
			THEY'RE MANIACS.

221	The Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the
	arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires
	his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT?
	Peter:	YOU GAME?	Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.	Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important
	mission.

	The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for
	it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222	The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander
	the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are
	confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering
	strides.223	Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They
	fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224	A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against
	each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving
	steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its
	balance holding on to the hand rail.
225	At another point down the length of the mall, there is a
	stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second	floor. Several creatures move up the steps.

226	At the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the
	steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the
	top landing.	Fran:	STEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.			(he continues)
			STEPHEN PLEASE!

	Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT.

227	At the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store,
	the two Troopers come to a crashing stop.

228	There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage
	point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about
	three hundred feet away.

229	Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the
	creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the
	big roll gate.	He fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks	the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.	The tumblers turn successfully.	Peter:	ALRIGHT!

230	On the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps
	are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself
	on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing
	Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective.

231	The Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead.

	Peter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still
	locked.	Peter:	YOU BASTARD!
	Roger:	WHAT?

	Peter:	STILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly)
			ON THE SIDE...

	The big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key
	fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the
	escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to
	shoot when something catches his eye.

232	The fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind the	escalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony
	floor.233	Roger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234	He hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is thrown	off balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the
	escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling.
	The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is
	still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle
	to stand.235	Roger looks back over his shoulder.236	The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and
	fifty feet away.

237	Peter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not
	lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on
	the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far
	left. Peter moves to it quickly.238	On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to	take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239	The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach
	the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They
	will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach
	the Department Store.

240	Roger fires again.

241	One of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap.

242	At the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE
			ROOF...243	Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness
	below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.

	Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS			DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.	More gunfire can be heard.244	Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into
	the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of
	the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He
	jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its
	fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still
	Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three
	feet above Peter's fingertips.245	The Zombies advance.246	Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he
	backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter
	is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach
	the gate.247	The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.

248	Peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too
	heavy for him to move himself.

	Peter:	HERE...COME ON...

	Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help
	drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the
	side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top
	of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at
	Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes
	him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but
	out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt
	around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,
	but is not dead.

	Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits
	on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his
	rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a
	move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the
	right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into
	the store.	Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up	on the counter.	Peter:	BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...

	The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics
	display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The	creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts
	to bring it down.

	There are several creatures right in the archway, now they
	clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the	gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The
	gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other
	creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.
	Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more
	leverage.	The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two
	men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very
	weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then
	one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets
	through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab
	for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is
	preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.	Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the
	creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt
	straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes
	limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,
	but the pressure is too great.
	Roger:	LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...

	The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their
	hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only
	big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,
	but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than
	Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.	With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear
	except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand
	suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.
	Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching
	upward.	Peter:	COME ON...COME ON...	Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by
	the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.	Peter:	THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.	Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm	clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down
	more steadily.	At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,
	but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks
	solidly into place.

	The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still
	moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers
	clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.
	There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the
	Department Store and several others are making their way along
	the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.	Roger:	WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA			GET BACK?	Peter:	LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.

	The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures
	outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's
	rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.

249	Stephen opens the door into the Administration corridor.

250	From his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the
	washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.

251	He starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close.

252	At the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from
	the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then
	it blinks out with a click as the door closes.	Fran:	STEPHEN...JESUS GOD...

	She is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253	She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the	roof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254	In the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He
	has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with
	goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,
	the surroundings are eerily quiet.255	He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking
	faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly
	startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around
	his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,
	where he finds Peter.

256	The big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up
	a small television.

	Roger:	HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...

257	Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something
	which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter
	has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.
	Roger:	OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?	Peter:	WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS
			FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO
			GET WHAT WE CAN.

	Roger:	THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...

	Even though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter
	toss things into the barrow.

258	They race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other
	supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop
	things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes
	in a store to grab whatever they can.259	Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and	electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260	At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey
	balcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance
	where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261	The Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their	prey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.

262	Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and
	start toward the offices.

263	Stephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all
	the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and
	many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all
	the workings and layout of the huge structure.264	Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers
	appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second
	storey aisles of the big store.265	Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it
	ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.
	When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are
	renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266	They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.	They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than
	the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until
	they see the lower level-roll gate.267	There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them	are at the gate.	Peter:	LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!

	The men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger
	speaks to the creature.

	Roger:	HEY, UGLY!

	The creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the
	gate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.
	The gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds
	tightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no
	immediate danger.	Peter:	LET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...
			(he is shouting)

	Roger:	OVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...

268	Other creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department
	Store. They lumber along attracted by the sounds.

269	At the gate, several Zombies push at the metal grids. The
	Troopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures.

	Peter:	JUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.

270	Upstairs, the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the
	commotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and
	lumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators.

271	In the maintenance office, Stephen still rummages. He finds a
	loaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large
	cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272	In the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the
	executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273	Several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down
	the up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first
	floor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the
	Department Store.
274	In the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate.
	Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the
	metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other
	creatures lumbering down the stationary steps.

275	Peter:	OK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...

	The big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.	Peter:	GO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOW			WHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.	Roger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles
	as he runs, crouching, into the store. Peter tries to hold the
	attention of the creatures at the gate.	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BABIES...THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT...
			YOU DUMB ASS SUCKERS...YOU DUMB...YOU ARE DUMB!

276	Upstairs, the doors to the elevator glide open again and Roger
	moves through the second floor aisles stealthily.277	Stephen takes the maintenance manual and leaves the office. He
	walks down the interior corridor and opens the door to the
	exterior corridor. As the door opens, the Zombies attack. The
	Zombies clutch as Stephen tries to close the door on Zombie 13's
	arm. Stephen then runs back down the interior corridor.

278	Stephen starts up the firestair to the door. Just then he hears
	Fran call out. Realising he will lead the creatures to her, he
	closes the door and moves toward the Maintenance office and runs
	in.

279	Stephen runs into the office and slams the door.

280	A second creature is moving up behind the first, and another
	enters the corridor from the accounting office.

281	The metal door locks only with a key. Stephen fumbles for a
	moment with his rifle, then dives for the key cabinet. There are
	hundreds of keys on rings. He looks at the wall map. He can't
	focus in his panic.

282	In the hall, the first creature slams against the floor. It
	doesn't even have the intelligence to reach for the knob. It
	pounds on the door with its hands.

283	The pounding increases Stephen's panic. He stares at the map
	trying to focus on the maze of numbers.

284	The second creature reaches the door and claws at it. The third
	approaches slowly.

285	Stephen rattles among the keys. His fingers shake and he cannot
	decipher the numbers.

286	Outside, one of the creatures, in its random clutching, takes
	hold of the knob and pushes in and out, not yet turning it.

287	Stephen, clutching one of the rings, throws himself against the
	door, still trying to read the numbers. The knob finally turns.
	The door opens against Stephen's weight. He manages to slam it
	shut despite the pushing creatures. He throws the key ring down
	and grabs his gun.

288	Roger speaks into his walkie talkie:

	Roger:	I THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON.

289	Peter, downstairs, talks into his unit:

	Peter:	CLEAR?

	Roger:	(over talking unit)
			NOT ALTOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT PRETTY
			GOOD...ENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON.

	The creatures slam against the first floor gate, but it holds
	securely. Peter stares at the beasts as he lowers his talk
	unit. He backs slowly away into the depths of the store.

290	Upstairs, Roger peers from behind a counter.

291	The second floor gate is clear.

292	On the balcony, several creatures wander aimlessly, but most of
	them have already moved down the steps and escalators.

293	Peter is still in sight of the Zombies at the first floor
	entrance. He clips his talk unit onto his belt, then ducks and
	disappears among the aisles.

294	He runs, crouching out of sight, until he rounds a far wall
	and comes up into the elevator.

295	He enters the car and pushes "2". The doors glide shut and the
	car begins to move up.

296	At the door of the Maintenance Office, the knob turns again. The
	door pushes open against Stephen weight. His feet slide on the
	linoleum floor. He cannot get the door closed this time. Biting
	his lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into
	the room holding his rifle high. The door flies open with a
	slam, and three Zombies advance into the office. Stephen tries
	to aim carefully, and he fires.

297	Just as the elevator doors open. Peter hears the gunfire. He
	hesitates for a moment, then runs toward the entrance arch.

298	Roger is poised at one of the side locks on the gate. The
	gunfire stops him also as he is unlocking the mechanism.

299	Along the balcony, some of the creatures turn around in con-
	fusion. They walk this way and that, attracted  by the sound.

300	Peter thunders up behind Roger.

	Peter:	WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

	Roger:	FUZZ MAYBE?

	Peter:	OR MAYBE FLYBOY. WHERE'S IT COMIN' FROM?

	Roger:	CAN'T TELL.

	Peter:	COME ON. OPEN UP.

	Roger :	 MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...

	Peter:	OPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT
			IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.

	Roger moves to the second lock. More gunfire.

	Peter:	(setting his weapon on the floor)
			YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR?

	Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to
	the handles of the barrow.

301	The body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot
	through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break
	into the Maintenance Office.

	The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He
	holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward
	the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges
	suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast
	tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the
	barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim
	accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's
	neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the
	gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the
	rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The
	Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and
	grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in
	the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to
	reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the
	cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but
	doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the
	tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite
	it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor.
	The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like
	an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow
	squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again
	and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an
	uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough
	for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve
	reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he
	fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.

302	The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out
	of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies.

303	The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures
	which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly.

304	Just as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one
	creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He
	manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the
	opening of the Administrative corridor.

305	Roger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the
	metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with
	Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite
	direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others
	are still too far away to waste bullets.

306	Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the
	maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out.

307	Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway.

308	At first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the
	firestair, his rifle poised.

309	Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie	steps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow
	squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the
	barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a
	wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its
	balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's
	jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out
	against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail,
	but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up
	quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no
	sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310	Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other	creatures throughout the area are again converging on the
	Department Store entrance.311	Peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the	other end, the three Zombies are still closing in.	Peter:	HOLD IT FLYBOY!312	Steve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by
	the Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313	Peter:	DON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314	Stephen is confused. The creatures advance.315	Peter:	DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM
			RIGHT UP WITH YOU.

316	Steve is on the verge of panic.

	Peter:	RUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY.
	The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT
			THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE!

318	Steve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to
	run past the Zombies.

319	Peter:	COME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON!

320	With a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the first	creature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the
	man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He
	keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path.
	Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The
	creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward
	the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the
	creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall
	where Peter waits.	Peter:	NOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321	The two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other	Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success.

322	At the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another
	creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and
	Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the
	gate without a problem.

	The Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching
	and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely.

	The men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate.

	Peter:	DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK.

323	The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing
	down the escalator.

324	On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they
	pull up wheezing with exhaustion.

	Steve:	WHAT DO WE DO...

	Roger:	LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...
			(shouting)
			WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.	Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles
	at the young pilot.

	Peter:	YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY.
			HOW 'BOUT IT?

	Stephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole-
	Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud:

	Steve:	WHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE...

	He has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant
	with the joy of their victory...
	The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are	already gathering at the gate.

325	Out on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most
	are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch.

326	On the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the
	stationary steps and the escalators.

327	The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward
	the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one
	turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads
	down the hall toward the firestair.

328	Fran can faintly hear the "whooping" of the men as she moves
	toward the stairway door, which is still open.329	She steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The	shouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the
	storage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns
	into anger.	Fran:	SHIT...	She takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up.
	Fran:	GOD DAMMIT!
	She starts back down again.

330	In the corridor below, the creature walks into another office.
	Then it moves back into the hall.

331	The Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The
	men crouch in the shadows of the gate.

	Roger:	WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE.

	Peter:	NO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM
			STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY.

	Roger:	YEAH, BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT.  WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.

	Peter:	IF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US, THEY'LL JUST
			FOLLOW US ON UP.  IT'S NO GOOD.

	Roger:	WE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN 'EM...LOAD UP WHAT
			WE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE.

	Peter:	I'M THINKIN' MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN' HERE.
			MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE.	Roger:	OH, MAN...	Peter:	IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEM			CATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE.
			AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH.
			CHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...	Roger:	MAN, I DON'T KNOW...	Steve:	THERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP
			OF THE STORES.

	The Troopers look at the young pilot, almost surprised to hear
	him speak.  He has been quiet up until now.

	Steve:	I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST HEATING DUCTS OR
			IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.

	Peter:	UPSTAIRS.  LET'S GO.

	The three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight
	around a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning
	and rattling the grid loudly.332	In the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on the	floor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor
	wanders into another office. The creature ignores the book, as
	it does the corpses strewn in the hall.333	In the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is
	suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at her	stomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head
	flop against the wall. She is almost in tears.334	The upstairs doors of the Department Store elevator open and the	men trot out. As they clear a wall, they see the entrance arch.335	There are no Zombies at the gate, but two are seen drifting
	along the balcony outside.

336	Peter:	WATCH IT...DON'T LET 'EM SEE YOU.

	The men move stealthily along the aisles. They look up at the
	ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines
	his flashlight beam into one.
337	The ceiling is about twelve feet high, but the light beam	penetrates the grille to reveal a fairly large space above.338	Roger:	LOOKS BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH.	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED.

	Roger:	DAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE
			SAW ON THE CHART.

	Steve:	WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?

	Peter:	JACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT.
	Roger:	WHAT?	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH			'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.	Steve:	OVER HERE.339	Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the
	elevators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double
	doors.	Peter:	THE ELEVATOR SHAFT!
	He moves over and hits the button. The doors open.
	Peter:	HOLD 'EM.	Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car
	doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches
	up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub-
	headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the
	hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.	Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340	He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way	and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.

	Peter:	IT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW-
			DRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE.

341	Roger:	I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE
			TABLES.

	Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby
	furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The
	elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has
	to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already
	climbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to
	hold the doors open and goes to get another.
	This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the
	opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs
	up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close
	again.342	In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator	mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight.	Peter:	IT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.
			YOU FOUND IT FLYBOY.

	Even though he speaks softly, Peter's voice has an eerie,
	echoing sound in the narrow shaft.

343	The car doors open. Steve ducks down to see Roger bearing a
	screwdriver and pliers along with some other tools in a shopping
	bag.	Roger:	ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT			AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344	Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to
	work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the
	flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345	Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very
	quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head
	snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There
	is a thump at the door.	Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the
	door below.	Fran:	STEPHEN!

	The door starts to open. Light creeps in. The slow, lumbering
	figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a
	scream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below
	follows, unsure of itself in the dim light.

346	At the top, Fran makes it into the storage area and slams the
	door. For a moment, she just backs away in terror. Then she
	gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a
	barricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very
	heavy and so large she cannot get a good grip. The smooth
	cardboard slips in her hands.347	The Zombie has almost reached the middle landing.
348	Roger looks down through a ceiling grid. He sees the interior of
	a Sporting Goods Store. Along one wall is an arsenal of the
	latest weaponry for the sportsman.349	Roger:	SWEET JESUS!
	Peter:	I SEEN IT. COME ON!	The men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the
	entire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can.
	There are several side tunnels branching off in both directions.

350	Steve passes another ceiling grid and looks down. He sees a
	full equipped radio and electronics shop.

	Roger:	I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN', BUDDY.

	Peter:	(who is leading)
			THIS IS IT. COME ON.

351	Fran struggles with the carton. She gets it against the door
	finally and moves to haul another.

352	The Zombie has reached the top landing and makes for the door.

353	Before the woman can bring another carton over, she sees the
	door move. She throws herself against it, but can't plant her
	feet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an
	inch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It
	clutches at the edge of the door.

354	Fran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she
	turns and faces the door.

355	The creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now,
	now both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves
	another inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen
	as it strains to get through the widening space.

356	Fran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something
	to use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and
	water drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she
	glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as
	the creature finally breaks into the big room.

357	The woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth
	sack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out:
	ammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She
	nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try
	to deal with the paper wrapping.

358	The Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the
	pyramid of cartons.

359	Fran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two
	at the mark.

360	Now the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her
	immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as
	she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the
	cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.
	Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the
	items and knocks and rolls the other flares.

	Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright
	flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's
	eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.
	The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature
	and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and
	wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over
	the articles on the floor.

	Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra
	cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The
	creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.

	Fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.
	She circles around to a point where she can climb up from
	behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and
	climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares
	and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off
	the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the
	Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.

	The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the
	skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops
	two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor
	behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's
	eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.

	Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both
	hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her
	feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she
	tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes
	and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;
	its hands can almost touch Fran's foot.

361	Peter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's
	legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on
	with his hands to soften his landing.

	Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the
	large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun.
	Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some
	days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head.

	Peter:	COME ON...

	Steve struggles overhead.

	Peter:	JUST DROP, I GOT YOU...		 

	Steve:	I CAN'T...I...

	Peter:	(to Roger)
			THE DESK...GIMME A HAND.

	The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the
	President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly
	and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.

	The desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses
	his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame
	off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of
	the President's wife and children.

	Peter:	COME ON!

	Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself
	down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk.

362	Peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it
	a crack and peeks out.

363	The corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads
	to the exterior corridor.

364	As the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly
	and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the
	door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves
	backwards toward the fire stairs.

365	Peter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the
	corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening.

366	In the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter
	backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man
	bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve
	notices that the fire stairs door is open wide.

	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST!

	He bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened.
	Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps.

	Roger:	(to Peter)
			COME ON...YOU GOT IT.

	Peter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the
	doorway, Roger breaks up the steps.

368	Steve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual...

	Steve:	FRANNIE!

369	The woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the
	flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as
	though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands.
	The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks.

370	Steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot.

	Roger:	DON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA...

	Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid.

371	The creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as
	Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls
	and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of
	his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger
	delivers a blow with his gun, straight down.

372	Steve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms
	sobbing and choking.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
			YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY...

	The woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach.

373	Peter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other
	items. He dumps them on the floor.

	Peter:	LET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON.

374	Roger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to
	help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets
	some water in a can and brings it over.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU
			HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE...

375	Downstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can
	see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger
	hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the
	floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open
	the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment.
	Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door.

376	Peter:	I THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER.

	They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs.

377	Steve still tries to comfort Fran.

	Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT
			OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...

	In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies
	into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go
	downstairs for another load.

	Steve:	THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE
			IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE.

	The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.

378	Now, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against
	the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of
	eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint
	electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it.

	As we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near
	the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep
	up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the
	Department Store's Gourmet department.

	Their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he
	eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a
	stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still
	boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small
	cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and
	notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards
	with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all
	functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered
	necessary by a consumer society.

	They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which
	Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the
	leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at
	first.

	Roger:	WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

	Steve:	ONLY ABOUT NINE.

	Roger:	AND NOTHING? (referring to the TV)

	On the screen we see the Civil Defence logo, and realise that
	the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set.

	Steve:	AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN,
			THAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING.

	Roger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. He rolls the
	dial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal
	and tunes it in. A badly modulated voice is droning through
	the interference. It sounds like a war correspondent sending
	a signal from very far away.

	Radio:	...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT
			HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA,
			BOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA
			AND NEW YORK CITY...

	Roger:	PHILLY...

	Steve:	I KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE
			BACK THERE...PEOPLE ARE CRAZY...IF THEY'D JUST
			ORGANISE...IT'S TOTAL CONFUSION...I DON'T
			BELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN THIS BAD. I DON'T BELIEVE
			THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. LOOK AT US. LOOT AT
			WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TODAY.

379	Peter's eyes suddenly blink open. None of the rest of his body
	moves, the others do not realise he is awake. The big man stares
	at Stephen, who is getting emotionally excited about their
	exploits as a team.

	Steve:	WE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF 'EM AND THEY
			NEVER TOUCHED US...NOT REALLY.

	Peter:	THEY TOUCHED US GOOD, FLYBOY. WE'RE LUCKY
			TO GET OUT WITH OUR ASSES. YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!

380	The other men look at Peter. The radio drones on with more
	disaster reports.

	Peter:	 YOU GET OVERCONFIDENT...UNDERESTIMATE THOSE
		    SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?

	Peter speaks in a low, unemotional tone. Stephen is transfixed.

	Peter:	 THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER.
		    THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT
		    THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH
		    OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY
		    DAY THERE'LL BE MORE.
		    A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY
		    FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR
		    BETTER WITH FOLK KNOCKIN' EACH OTHER OFF THE
		    WAY IT'S GOIN'.
		    NOW SAY EACH ONE OF THEM COMES BACK AND KILLS
		    TWO, AND EACH ONE OF THEM TWO MORE...
		    YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S REWARD?	 

381	We see Fran's face. She is listening. There is no answer
	audible. A tear rolls down the woman's cheek. The radio drones.

	After a time, Steve appears. He is surprised to find the woman
	awake. She sits on a new blanket from the store. Another is
	rolled up as a pillow. She wipes away her tears with her
	cigarette still in her hand.

	Steve:	HEY...YOU OK?

	The man kneels next to her, not knowing what to say. Stephen
	sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders.

	Fran:	SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?

	Steve:	(taking her in his arms)
			JESUS, FRANNIE, THIS SET UP IS SENSATIONAL.
			WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. WE SEAL OFF THAT
			STAIRWAY...NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW WE'RE UP HERE.
			WE'D NEVER FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS...

	Fran:	I GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?

	Steve:	COME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.

	Fran:	WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?
			WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS...
			HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY...
			STEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS
			PLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY
			WRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT
			CAN BE A PRISON.

	She leans in to him, making a final plea.

	Fran:	STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP
			GOING.

	Steve:	WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.

	Fran:	(angry)
			WHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A
			FREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE
			WHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.

382	Cut to a close up of Peter's face. His eyes pop open.

	Peter:	SHUT THAT THING OFF!

	Roger clicks off the radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds
	coming from the fire stairs. The end of the room with the
	barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV
	screen which still shines.

	Roger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well. The electronic
	whistle slowly dies. Silence.

	Steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. Fran peers
	around the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor.
	Another noise. The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of
	the steps. Then footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow...
	lumbering.

	The faces of the humans all tighten. Peter and Roger pull their
	rifles. Roger makes his ready.

	Some thumping in the hall. Steve squats down and holds Fran.
	The sounds are closer now. The door behind the cartons clicks
	but does not move. More pounding...then silence.

	After a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.

	Peter:	SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.

	Roger:	THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.

	Peter:	ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS
			WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD
			GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.

	Roger:	WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY
			IT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD
			LIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU
			KNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE
			OF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY
			IT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN
			THING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.

	Peter:	SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO
			HOW MUCH ITS WORTH.

383	Fran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another
	cigarette. Steve sits next to her again.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...

	She doesn't respond.

	Steve:	DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D
			HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH?
			THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE
			AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME...
			MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE.
			WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE!

	Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket.

	Steve:	COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.

	The woman doesn't move.

	Steve:	FRANNIE. COME ON.

	She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches
	out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub
	up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her
	blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems
	perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves
	under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body
	relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his
	head.

	Steve:	I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS
			IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO
			SET UP HOUSE.

	She stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to
	move under her blouse.

384	In the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among
	the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded
	creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had
	been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs.

	A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She
	lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it
	quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at
	another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall.

	Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the
	second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over
	the scene.

	Voice:	...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE
			TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE
			ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
			HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON
			EACH OTHER.

385	We see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores.
	Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse.
	Below.

	Voice:	THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN
			FLESH...

386	At the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night.
	Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many
	as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough
	to be threatening.

	Voice:	INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING
			POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE
			REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE.

387	Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department
	store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted
	eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the
	Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge.

	Voice:	THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS,
			BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE...
			THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC.,
			EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN
			THIS MANNER.

388	Fran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been
	asleep on the blanket.

	Voice:	THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED
			INSTINCT...

	The woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through
	the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of
	the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the
	tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room
	reading the report.

389	Voice:	THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS
			THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT
			THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS.
			THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY
			MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT....

390	Fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at
	the fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the
	pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof.

391	At the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars.

392	About a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of
	a food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open
	garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-
	trucks parked.

393	Steve:	YOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM.

	Roger:	YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET.

	Peter:	WELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY
			OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'.

	The big trooper looks down to the parking lot below.

394	There are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and
	they wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters.

395	The men move for the skylight.

396	In the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the
	manual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb
	down into the room.

	Roger:	HEY, FRAN...

	Fran:	I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I
			DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS.

	There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses
	the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment.

	Fran:	CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

	Steve:	SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?

	Fran:	I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I
			DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY
			THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY.

	Steve:	HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...

	Fran:	AND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.

	They all look at her, attentive now.

	Fran:	AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I
			WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S
			FOUR OF US, OK?

	Steve:	JESUS, FRAN...

	Peter:	FAIR ENOUGH!

	Fran:	NOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

	Peter:	WE'RE GOIN' OUT.

	Fran starts to say something, but this time Peter cuts her off.

	Peter:	...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!

	Again the woman starts to protest, but Peter continues.

	Peter:	AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN
			HANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND
			LEARN TO FIGHT.

	The big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to
	follow him.

	Fran:	SOMETHING ELSE.

	The men look at her. She faces Roger and Peter directly without
	looking at Stephen.

	Fran:	I DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN
			HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER.

	Stephen is shocked. Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.

	Fran:	IF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET
			OUT OF HERE.

	Stephen doesn't know what to say. He looks at the woman,
	then up at the other men.

	Peter:	SHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.

	Fran:	AND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.

	Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly
	setting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his
	pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun.
	He stares at the woman angry and hurt.

	Fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter. 
			
	Fran:	I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
			IT.

	Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight. Stephen stands
	still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side.

	Fran:	I'M SORRY, STEPHEN. (it is not an apology)

	Steve:	I KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!

	He starts up to the skylight.

	Fran:	STEPHEN

	Steve:	YEAH.

	He stops and turns to look at her. Her eyes are pleading for
	understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran
	just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs
	with exasperation.

	Fran:	BE CAREFUL.

	Steve:	YEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

	He disappears through the skylight. Fran stares down at the
	weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the
	television.

397	The sudden, loud noise of the chopper engine as it hovers.
	Only Stephen is on board at the controls.

398	In the cab of one of the big trailer trucks Roger is crouching
	working on the wiring beneath the dashboard.

399	Peter sits on the cab of another truck. He tries the
	complicated shift mechanism and fidgets with the other controls.
	Then he pulls out. He stops the big vehicle with his cab just
	abreast of the cab Roger is working in.

	Peter:	HOW ABOUT IT?

	Roger:	GETTIN' IT.

400	Peter looks around. The mall can be seen in the distance. On the
	ground between, there are a few Zombies scattered about in
	little clusters. None of them present any immanent danger.

401	Roger sits up and is able to start his truck.

	Peter:	I'LL JUST RIDE PICK UP, I'M NOT TOO SURE OF
			THIS THING...

	Roger:	I GREW UP ON ONE OF THESE, LET'S GO.

402	The great trucks lumber away from the warehouse. They pull
	across the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the
	roadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following
	the trucks as closely as he can.

403	On the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the
	big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above
	them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the
	trucks as closely as it can.

404	Along the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks
	but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The
	creatures lumber along slowly behind.

405	The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the
	mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building.

406	At one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is
	moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the
	parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the
	creatures turn and face the trucks.

	As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right
	up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance
	doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with
	a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast
	of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle
	crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other
	flying back.

407	The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall
	entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass
	doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough
	for the creatures to get out.

408	The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering
	at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as
	other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab.

409	Overhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big
	truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is
	directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab.

	Peter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but
	there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab.

410	As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one
	of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the
	creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the
	lot.

411	The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of
	the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the
	action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind
	from the chopper whipping her hair.

412	The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under
	it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse
	down the road.

413	Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig
	pulls up beside another of the parked vans.

	Peter:	COME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY.

	Roger:	LIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM!

	Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he
	immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.

414	From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving
	around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a
	better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out
	of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck.

415	In the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is
	in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the
	warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily.

416	Stephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he
	can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man.

417	Roger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a
	child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just
	about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't
	notice.

418	Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to
	pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight
	for him.

419	The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around
	heading back for Roger.

420	Peter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering
	creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the
	complicated shift mechanism fights him.

421	One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of
	Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself
	from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is
	stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger
	side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's
	legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He
	falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted
	among the controls and the shift sticks.

422	Peter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly.

423	The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do
	not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the
	creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they
	claw at the desperate Roger.

424	The man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from
	his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck
	for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers
	inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest
	of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention.

425	Peter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for
	Roger's cab.

426	The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action.

427	Now Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the
	long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is
	actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the
	struggling Trooper.

428	The second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a
	great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it.

429	Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth
	away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but
	Roger is still hampered by the position he is in.

430	Peter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig
	into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line
	with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims,
	but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to
	overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering
	helicopter.

	Peter:	GET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP...

431	Roger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the
	creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a
	stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his
	might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's
	fingers push at the man's eyes.

432	Peter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly.

433	The Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain
	tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window.
	The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp,
	but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is
	now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic.
	He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the
	creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion.
	He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his
	face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions.

	A sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has
	smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still
	shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon.

434	Peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is
	in the way...

	Peter:	GET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT!

435	Roger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels
	off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through
	the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures
	head.

	Roger:	YOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS...	

	It seems as though his mind is snapping. His voice quivers as
	does his body.

	Roger:	WE GOT 'EM, BUDDY...WE GOT 'EM DIDN'T WE!

436	Peter:	COOL IT, MAN...GET YOUR HEAD...

437	Roger:	WE GOT THIS BY THE ASS...GOT THIS BY THE ASS!

	Roger is screaming. He dives down to work on the jumping again.

438	Peter:	HEY, ROG...GET YOUR HEAD MAN...COME ON...
			WE GOT A LOT TO DO...ROGER...

439	There is no response from the other truck. Peter is about to
	open his door and step out when suddenly Roger sits up again.
	The engine of the truck roars. He seems to have calmed down
	some. He looks across at Peter.

	Roger:	LET'S GO BABY...NUMBER TWO...

	Peter:	YOU ALRIGHT?

	Roger:	PERFECT, BABY...PERFECT!

	Roger guns the engine on his truck. The big vehicle lumbers out
	of the area. Peter follows suit.

440	The two Semis rumble out of the warehouse lot and start down the
	grade toward the road. The helicopter escorts them.

441	A few Zombies are walking up the road slowly.

442	Roger's eyes get wider with anger. He steers his big rig right
	for the creatures.

443	The front of the cab smashes into two of them. One is crushed
	under the wheels, the other flies back from the impact.

444	Fran watches with anxiety. She sees the two trucks pull up over
	the rise with the helicopter following. We hear spirited music
	as the convoy approaches the mall building.

445	The two trucks roar around the entrance ramps into the parking
	lot and again, the chopper zooms right over the roof.

446	Fran trots across the roof to see the action in the lot.

447	the trucks rumble toward the second set of doors. The music
	continues through the entire action.

448	Roger steers his giant vehicle directly broadside to the doors.
	The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building
	as the trailer blocks off the entrance. This time there are
	still creatures alive in the immediate area. They clutch at the
	cab of the truck and leap at the doors.

449	Fran, watching from directly above, seems inspired, caught up in
	the bravery of the moment. As she sees the creatures converging
	on the truck, she aims her rifle at them. Before she fires,
	Peter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast.

450	Peter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures.
	One Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still
	alive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at
	Peter's driver side window.

451	Roger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's
	side, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open
	enough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed
	Roger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear
	shift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting:

	Roger:	THE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...

	Peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.
	Roger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into
	firing position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the
	narrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach
	Roger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move
	around Roger's cab, moments away from him.

452	The helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies
	converge on the cab.

453	Fran, her hair blowing front he chopper, tries to aim her rifle
	into the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she
	brushes it away with irritation.

	Fran:	ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...

	She shouts over the engine noises, getting very excited.

454	Roger fires again and again down the narrow space between the
	rigs. Another Zombie falls.

	Peter:	FOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!

	Roger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in
	a very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as
	he tries to level off another shot.

	Suddenly, he's grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls
	out the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on
	his gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature,
	but can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on
	Peter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature
	grabs him from behind.

455	Fran watches with emotion in her eyes.

	Fran:	MONSTERS! MONSTERS!

	She fires her gun.

456	The bullet slams into the pavement kicking up a cloud of smoke.
	It narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears
	into the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him.

457	The chopper zooms very close. Peter still cannot aim his rifle,
	but Roger, using both hands, brings his gun butt in an uppercut.
	It slams against a creature which is grabbing him and drives the
	thing staggering back. Then with a desperate driving motion, 
	Roger climbs through the window of Peter's cab.

458	Peter pulls the big rig away even while Roger's legs still kick
	out the window. The Zombies grab at Roger's ankles, and one
	manages to hold on as the truck starts to move.

459	Fran fires again and again.

460	This shot rips into the Zombie holding Roger's leg. It lets go
	and falls, rolling across the pavement. The woman fires again,
	hitting the pavement. The creature struggles to its knees. She
	fires again and hits the creature's neck. Again.
	Shoulder. Again...head. The Zombie sprawls on the pavement. Fran
	is exultant, she aims and fires at another creature.

461	The helicopter passes overhead. The music is still stirring.

462	In Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises:

	Roger:	JESUS!

	Peter:	WHAT?

	Roger:	MY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE
			OTHER TRUCK.

	Peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt.

	Peter:	ALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU
			BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY!

	Roger:	YEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO.

	Suddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams
	him back against the door of the cab.

	Peter:	I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH
			YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE!

	The two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled
	somewhat out of his emotional rush.

	Peter:	(softer)
			ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT?

	Roger:	YEAH.

	Peter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine
	and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot.

463	When Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun
	sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and
	Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the
	road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen.

464	He finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal
	and the chopper buzzes back over the lot.

465	Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle
	ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon
	pulling the shells from her blouse pocket.

466	Peter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of
	Zombies in the vicinity.

467	Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original
	cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are
	strewn over the seat and floor.

	Again, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up
	between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab.

468	Fran is still loading.

469	The helicopter buzzes.

470	As Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally
	falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the
	cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures
	which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of
	the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick
	sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his
	pack and is grabbed from behind.

471	Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot.

472	Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof.

473	Roger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the
	pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck
	as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball.

474	Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and
	onto the floor of the cab.

475	The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the
	man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the
	man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound.
	Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw.
	The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies
	behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's
	cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally
	kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the
	struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of
	the door, but they slip.

476	Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger
	falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his
	hand gun.

477	Roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The
	Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and
	kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his
	feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm
	with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's
	shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs.

	Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot
	at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able
	to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the
	window when another creature grabs him.

478	Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the
	big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his
	might.
	
479	Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle,
	kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one
	of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's
	left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf.
	Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes
	away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op
	material from Roger's trousers.

480	Roger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck
	accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear.

481	It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops.
	Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still
	has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its
	hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important
	morsels.

	A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another
	tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its
	prize.

482	Fran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars.
	She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head.

483	We see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk
	by the corpse without taking notice.

484	The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse.

485	As it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt
	tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his
	teeth in anguish.

	Peter:	THAT'S IT.

	Roger:	BULL SHIT.

	Peter:	WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!

	Roger:	I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE!
			I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.

	Peter:	CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?

	Roger:	YOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!

	The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg
	with a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from
	screaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths
	between them.
 
	Roger:	I STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN'
			AGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE
			YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME...

	The big Black man stares at his friend for a moment. Then he
	drives on to the warehouse escorted by the chopper.

486	There is now a huge trailer truck at each of the four main
	entrances to the mall. They are very close to the doors, if not
	completely flush. Some of the glass portals can be opened not
	slightly, but not enough for the Zombies inside to pass through.

487	In the parking lot, the creatures mob around the trucks,
	frustrated that they cannot pass into the building. They clutch
	and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to
	climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the
	trailers.

488	Some creatures are crawling under the rigs: When they reach the
	mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The
	creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under
	the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out,
	so it is very clear that some access could be had by the
	creatures if they were more organised.

	One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to
	push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building
	through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They
	behave as a swarm of insects.

	The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures,
	although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty
	brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which
	blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the
	rotating action and enters the concourse.

489	Peter and Stephen are huddled over the maps of the building.
	They are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled
	against the firestair entrance.

	Peter:	IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL
			INSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES.

	Steve:	WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES...OR MAYBE
			SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS.

	Peter:	THE GUNS ARE FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.

490	Roger moans with pain. Nearby, Fran is applying a dressing to
	his leg. The wound is wrapped with several layers of cloth. The
	first aid kit is open on the floor. Peter crouches near his
	friend. He takes over from Fran. He ties more strips tightly
	around the wound and around the upper thigh.

	Peter:	YOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT, BUDDY?

	Roger:	JUST HURRY UP WITH THAT!

491	Again, the military music. A tall figure drops out of a ceiling
	grid and lands on the floor of the Sporting Goods Store. It is
	Peter. His rifle is slung and there is an empty pack on his
	back. Several of the Maintenance Room key rings are strapped
	into his belt.

492	Suddenly a Zombie charges across the room. The gate to the mall
	balcony is open on this store. Another creature, attracted by
	the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch.

493	Stephen is starting down through the ceiling grid. He also has
	equipment strapped onto his body. He sees the charging creature.
	Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear
	of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples
	up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things
	flying.

	Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing
	creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is
	moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a
	nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound
	and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull
	and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a
	few steps before it falls.
 
494	The men run toward the entrance arch. Leaping up on an adjacent
	counter top, Peter manages to reach the lip of the roll gate and
	he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams
	it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and
	clawing.

	Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the
	creature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.

	Peter:	DON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES.
			OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP
			CHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE.

	The Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage.
	Stephen startles.

	Peter:	HE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...

495	The men crash back through the store and Peter moves right to
	the racks of weapons. He pulls down a gorgeous high powered
	rifle which is equipped with a sophisticated scope for sighting.

	Peter:	AIN'T IT A CRIME!

	Steve:	WHAT?

	Peter:	(looking through the telescope)
			THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS
			GUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.

496	The cross hairs of the telescope zero in on the enlarged
	forehead of the Zombie, which is thrashing against the roll
	gates. The sight gives up a sense of the super-weapon's lethal
	accuracy.

497	Stephen dives into the ammunition and moves behind the counter
	where he pulls out boxes of shiny new hand guns.

	Peter finds elaborate holsters and ammunition belts. He pulls
	several other rifles from the rack. We recognise the firepower
	in the arsenal that the two men accumulate.

498	Other Zombies appear at the gate, but they cannot break in.

499	Peter:	(at the creatures)
			YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES...
			WE COMIN'...AND WE READY!

500	With a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges
	out of the Maintenance corridor and makes a break for the
	Department Store. They all wear new double holsters containing
	hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and
	another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with
	other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big
	gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first
	supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart
	before him.

	There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things
	turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos.
	Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times
	at some of the creatures who are closest.

501	The creatures from the main concourse below begin to move up
	the stationary staircase and struggle with the escalators.
	The corpses of creatures slain in the earlier battles still
	clutters in the area.

502	Fran and Steve are the first to reach the entrance to the 
	Department Store. Steve falls immediately on the gate locks.
	Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the
	cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall.

	Steve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies
	which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new
	Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars
	eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single
	shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the
	creatures.

	The man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a
	third. Roger fires several times.

	Fran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the
	final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up.
	Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but
	Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp.

	Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him.
	Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of
	the advancing creatures reach the area.

503	Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are
	already running through the aisles of the big store.

504	Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the
	first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down.

	Peter:	HOW'S THE RIDE?

	Roger:	KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.

	The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded
	man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in
	Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely
	on the Trooper's shoulder.

	Peter:	LOOK HERE...I...

	Roger:	I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.

	Something very serious is shared between the two men, some
	knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the
	kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle.

505	The elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out
	into the first floor on the big store.

506	Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster
	than the steps themselves.

507	They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches
	up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas
	into her back pack.

508	With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot
	flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds
	two torches as Stephen lights them.

509	Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in
	front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into
	sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid
	but it holds as usual.

	Peter:	UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST.

510	Steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies
	all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They
	push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and
	the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves
	to the extreme left.

	Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch.

	Peter:	ALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN'
			BY THESE RIGHT HERE...

	Steve:	IT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE.

511	Peter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the
	concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the
	Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is
	one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a
	truck trailer.

512	Peter:	WE'LL BE ALRIGHT!

	Fran:	IT'S TOO FAR!

	Peter:	THERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK
			THOSE DOORS!

	Fran:	WE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY.

	Steve:	YOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US.

	Fran:	THE CAR!

	Peter:	WHAT?

	Fran:	THE CAR!

513	Outside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the
	new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast
	and manoeuvrable.

514	Peter looks down at Roger.

	Peter:	YOU OK TO START IT?

	Roger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing
	with pain, but he moves efficiently.

515	The Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked
	ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out.
	Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away.
	Steve un-locks the middle lock.

	Steve:	IT'S GOIN' UP!

516	The gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack
	but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs
	one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol
	with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into
	the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move
	in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve
	but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair
	catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about,
	knocking other Zombies back.

517	Now Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart.
	Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered
	pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit.
	There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path.

	Peter:	(shouting)
			CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE...

518	Steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is
	still inside the store with one of the torches.

	Fran:	THE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS!

	Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it
	slams shut with a metallic crash.

	Fran:	JESUS CHRIST!

519	Peter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He
	looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart.
	They advance slowly.

520	Several have stayed with Stephen, however, and they approach
	Stephen as he tries to pass the keys back through the gate.
	The big ring doesn't fit through the small openings.

	Steve:	 YOU MOTHER!

	Fran:	KEEP 'EM...JUST KEEP 'EM...LOOK OUT!

	The Zombies at Stephen's back are very close. Steve lunges at
	them with his torch. They back off slightly.

521	Peter:	COME ON, MAN! GET OUTA THERE!

	The creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart. A
	pained Roger levels off several shots, but he is very shaky from
	his extreme pain. He manages to down one of the Zombies.

522	Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD SAKE...

	The woman holds up her torch so that the bright flame faces the
	ghouls. Stephen crouches and puts a key in the right hand lock.
	The Zombies converge on him.

523	Peter, seeing other creatures drawing near, starts to push the
	cart again. he manages to dodges two little clusters of the
	walking dead.

524	The lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs Stephen from
	behind, Fran tries to aim her torch closer. It disarms the
	Zombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking
	the think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under
	the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single
	lock undone.

	Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch
	is knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries
	to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds
	her torch high.

	Steve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies
	are on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the
	floor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He
	crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and
	tugging at his pants and shirt.

	He brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies. They back
	away enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles
	to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.

525	At the exhibit, Peter stops the cart. There are two of the
	lumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his
	rifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up
	out of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the
	oncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits.

526	As Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform, he falls and
	rolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward
	another creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's
	door of the vehicle.

527	Steve, who is approaching at a run, sees the action.

	Steve:	WATCH IS ROGER...ROGER!

528	Roger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature
	grabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which
	is already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams
	loudly.

529	Peter jumps up onto the spinning turntable, leans across the
	hood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the
	creature's skull. It falls off the exhibit.

530	Peter hurriedly comes around to Roger's side. In extreme pain,
	the Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter
	helps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the
	seat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash.

531	Zombies are advancing now from all over the concourse.

532	Peter:	GET IN!

	He is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the
	platform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the
	back seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons
	are locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.

533	Several of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall
	trying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to
	struggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their
	hands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the
	shiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles.

534	Fran has relocked the one open gate mechanism, and she stands
	now trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of
	vision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and
	pounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle
	extinguishing the flame.

535	The car's engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires.

	Steve:	I'LL DRIVE IT...

	Roger:	I GOT IT.

	The Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into
	position behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip
	and slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures
	crawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger
	waits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The
	men in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at
	the windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against
	the safety glass.

536	Now the car pulls out quickly. It rolls of the edge of the
	spinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The
	front wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor,
	but the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is
	stuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the
	car with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin
	and finally catch.

537	The car shoots out onto the mall floor. Some of the Zombies
	cling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to
	regain their footing and follow.

538	The car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will
	crash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to
	control it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous
	energy.

539	One of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept
	the speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as
	though he were a bowling pin.

540	Fran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for
	the main entrance which she can see from her position.

541	The Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall
	attracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse
	easily breaking their ranks.

542	Roger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching
	tailspin, stopping just at the doors.

543	The big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some
	creatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are
	struggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as
	though it will be able to enter.

544	Peter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch
	directly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws
	its arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The
	door slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They
	are all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism.

	Peter:	THAT'S NOT 100%, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GET
			THROUGH.

	Steve:	CAN'T THEY SMASH THE GLASS?

	Peter:	SAFETY STUFF...PRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLE...THEY GOT
			NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS...

545	Steve rummages in his back pack. Produces two portable battery
	operated burglar alarms. Peter activates the units, stands them
	against the base of the now locked doors. As he crouches near
	the glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the
	glass doors. They cannot get in.

	Peter:	I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND
			THEY CAN'T GET IN...

546	The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting
	close to the action.

547	The men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at
	the wheel.

548	Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing
	Zombies. They fall and scatter.

549	The car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where
	Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice
	on the woman's walkie talkie.

	Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK.

	Fran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are
	staggering weakly after the car.

550	With another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of
	doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies
	outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them
	out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to
	look down the concourse.

551	The creatures seem even more spread out now.

	Steve:	HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN...

	Peter:	DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE
			GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT!
  
	The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the
	telescope.

552	As we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead
	of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The
	face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and
	the head in the scope explodes with red.

553	The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the
	brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon.

554	It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around
	the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow
	piece of music starts to build.

555	The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall.
	They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail.

556	From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the
	revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but
	the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the
	glass panels and they have no tools to pound with.

	The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering
	added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They
	are the early warning devices against penetration.

557	They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain
	corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the
	building. It is like a battlefield after a war.

558	The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the
	railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are
	guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have
	taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look
	over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he
	limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms.

559	We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building.
	Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of
	the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven.

560	Peter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is
	drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near
	the firestair.

	Peter:	WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM
			THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL
			GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE
			PLUMBING...

	Steve:	WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL,
			THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS.

	Peter:	I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR
			LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS
			MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT
			STAIRWAY EXISTS.

	They look back at the map.

	Peter:	THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS.
			WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL
			BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP
			THE WALL.

561	The men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with
	mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the
	stuff all sits around in disarray.

562	Behind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he
	is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been
	trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she
	stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out
	to Stephen and Peter.

563	Fran:	HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING.

	Peter:	GOOD.

564	The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the
	cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as
	well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall.

	Fran:	I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO...

	Steve:	YOU'RE DOIN' FINE.

	Fran:	HIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST.
			CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED.
			UNIT...

565	Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly.

	Peter:	I'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE
			THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX
			HOURS.

566	Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons.

	Roger:	PETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU?

567	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BUDDY.

568	Roger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is
	sweating even more profusely than before.

	Roger:	YEAH...YEAH...

	He licks his lips. He looks around the vast, barren room, trying
	to clear his eyesight.

569	Outside, Fran sits on a carton. The men are still huddled
	around the spoils. Roger occasional shouts from the other
	room.

	Roger:	WE DID IT, HUH, BUDDY? WE WHIPPED 'EM.

	Peter:	THAT'S RIGHT ROG.

	Roger:	DIDN'T WE? PETER? DIDN'T WE WHIP 'EM?

	Peter:	WE SURE DID, BUDDY.

	Roger:	WE WHIPPED 'EM AND GOT IT ALL! WE GOT IT ALL!

	The man's voice sounds pathetic as it echoes through the big
	storage area bouncing off barren walls.

570	A hammer slams into nails behind the fake wall which the people
	are working on. A great network of two-by-fours are braced at
	the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls
	making a frame. Stephen is slamming large nails into the
	framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite
	panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the
	corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the
	new partition look like a finished wall.

	In the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast
	array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from
	out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which
	has obviously been used.

	Fran:	THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS
			PERFECT.

	Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw
	driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto
	the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a
	perfect match.

	Steve:	(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE
			IT OFF?

	Fran:	NO...

	The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper.

571	The corpses from the hall have been carried out of the way.
	They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony.
	It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away.

572	Fran:	NO.

	She steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against
	the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke
	back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another
	wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down
	his hammer and follows.

573	The woman is kneeling on the floor, propped up by her hands on
	the toilet seat. She is vomiting. Steve approaches quietly. His
	hand falls on her back.

	Fran:	LEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM.

	Steve:	FRANNIE...

	Fran:	JUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU
			HERE.

	The man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She
	clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.

	Fran:	I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY...

	Another wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her
	hand back leaning over the toilet bowl.

	Fran:	PLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE...

	Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The
	woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits
	on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She
	fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water
	makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of
	her pregnancy.

574	Stephen steps out of the unfinished framework. Peter is gazing
	down the corridor at the pile of corpses.

	Peter:	THIS PLACE IS GONNA BE ROTTEN...WE GOTTA
			CLEAN UP, BROTHER.

	Flies buzz about the staring faces of the dead things on the
	balcony.

575	Peter's hands are on the round hatch wheel of an enormous safe.

	Peter:	THEY'RE USUALLY ON A TIMER...OPEN AT
			NINE...LOCKED AT FOUR...KEEPS THE BANKERS HONEST.

	The wheel spins and Peter swings the giant door open.

576	Inside is a huge safety deposit vault of a bank. The men stand
	for a moment in awe. The clean walls are lined with drawers and
	doors where depositors have stored their valuables. At one end
	of the room there are stacks and stacks of paper bills. The men
	approach the piles of money, stooping down.

	They each pick up packets of bills and flip through the edges...

	Peter stuffs several packets into his knapsack. Steve looks at
	him quizzically.

	Peter:	YOU NEVER KNOW, BROTHER.

	Steve takes several stacks and stuffs them into his kit. He
	looks about the enormous vault.

	Steve:	DON'T YA WONDER WHAT THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ARE GONNA
			THINK...GUYS IN THE FUTURE...DIGGIN' THE PLACE
			UP. IMAGINE ALL THE STUFF IN THESE BOXES...
			JEWELLERY...MAYBE THEY'LL FIGURE IT'S ALL SOME
			KIND OF OFFERING TO THE GODS...LIKE IN THE
			PYRAMIDS...A BURIAL CHAMBER.

	Peter:	THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, NOW.....

577	We see the men wheeling gardening carts piled with corpses. The
	sombre image is shocking as the figures move in silhouette
	against the bright store fronts with their displays of goods
	designed to attract shoppers to the sweet life the items
	pretend to represent.

578	At the bank, Peter wheels a cart with several dead Zombies
	through the lobby.

579	In the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of
	several others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their
	arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the
	limp action of the bodies as they roll around.

580	A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up
	slowly.

581	We see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through
	the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking
	up various items. They use shopping carts.

582	Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department.

583	Peter looks through a book store.

584	Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room.

585	Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror.

586	Fran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of
	the mall Barber Shop.

587	Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed,
	she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the
	concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly.

588	Now the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down.
	They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide
	brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat.

589	The concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear
	the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark
	outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in
	the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences
	their presence, however.

590	The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm.

	Fran:	THEY'RE STILL HERE.

	Steve:	THEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE.

	Peter:	THEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW
			WHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT
			THEY WANNA BE IN HERE!

	The noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be
	afraid.

	Fran:	WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY?

	Peter:	THEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE
			ROOM IN HELL.

	Steve:	WHAT?

	Peter:	SOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU
			KNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST
			IN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO
			MORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH.

591	Roger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks
	sunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to
	hold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which
	was also bitten, is wrapped but oozing.

	Steve:	GET MORE VALIUM IN HIM...

	Fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial
	of serum and it shatters on the floor.

	Steve:	GET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON...

	Roger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to
	hold on. Fran rushes into the other room.

592	The space is starting to look like living quarters. There is
	furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still
	packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home.

593	The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more
	organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She
	takes a new vial of serum from the freezer.

594	Downstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of
	the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above.

595	He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the
	grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the
	ladder and closes the grill.

596	He crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out
	of another grill into the washroom.

597	He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 

598	All the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up
	the stairs several at a time.

599	He rushes through the living space in the direction of the
	screams.

600	Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man
	still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter
	rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room.

	After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat.

	Peter:	(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM.

	Steve leaves the area.

601	In the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the
	inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve
	comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind.
	She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares
	off across the room.

602	Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his
	lips and tries to speak coherently.

	Roger:	YOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER?
			YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO...

	Peter:	I WILL.

	Roger:	I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER...
			NOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND
			LIKE THAT...

	The man's eyes are terrified. He looks this way and that at the
	walls, the ceiling, at Peter...He can't focus...

	Roger:	PETER? PETER?

	Peter:	I'M HERE, TROOPER.

	Roger:	YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...I KNOW YOU WILL...

	Peter:	I WILL.

	Roger:	PETER?

	Peter:	YEAH, BROTHER.

	Roger:	PETER, DON'T DO IT...TIL YOUR SURE...SURE I'M COMIN'
			BACK...DON'T DO IT TIL YOU'RE SURE...I MIGHT NOT
			COME BACK, PETER...I'M GONNA TRY NOT TO...I'M
			GONNA TRY...NOT TO COME BACK...

603	Later, the moon shines down through the skylight in the living
	area. A sturdy ladder has now replaced the pyramid of cartons
	up to the open hatch.

604	Stephen fiddles with the television. There is a faint signal
	coming in. He has the set wired to a makeshift antenna which
	stretches through the skylight. A table lamp sits on a small
	end table and is lit. Its cable is patched into a network of
	wiring which stretches about the room.

605	Fran is unpacking things. She is stacking dishes and silverware.
	It is a very orderly scene. The couple looks like a pair of
	newlyweds who have just moved into a new house.

606	On the television, two men are talking, a commentator and an
	official of the Government. The Scientist is in a suit, but his
	tie is rumpled and his collar open. He has not shaved and he
	seems very tired and nervously upset.

	Scientist:   I'VE GOT TO...BE CAREFUL WITH WORDS HERE...WE
			HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THEIR HABITS...WE'VE
			REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIVE CAPTURE SO WE CAN HAVE
			CONTROLLED STUDY...WE NEED SUPPLY AND DEMAND
			RATIOS.

	Comm.:	YOU MEAN...THEIR NEED VERSUS...

	Scientist:   VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE. LETS BE BLUNT.

	There is a commotion in the TV studio. We hear noises and
	shouting, as we did J.A.S. earlier.

607	Steve:	JESUS CHRIST.

	He squats near the set, staring. Fran comes up behind him.

608	Scientist:   PROJECT OUT THEIR RATE OF GROWTH...THERE'S A
			CRITICAL BALANCE...AND IT'S THE WASTE THAT KILLS
			US. LITERALLY...THEY USE...THEY USE MAYBE FIVE
			PERCENT OF THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE HUMAN
			BODY...AND THEN THE BODY IS USUALLY INTACT ENOUGH
			TO BE MOBILE WHEN IT REVIVES. THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL
			IMBALANCE AND THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING...

	Comm.:	WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

	Scientist:   WE HAVE TO BE UNEMOTIONAL...WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
			COUNTER MEASURES OR WE'RE ALL...

	Comm.:	COUNTER MEASURES?

	Scientist:   THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH AND CON-
			SUMPTION...WE HAVE TO CONTROL IT FOR THEM!

	Comm.:	YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE HELP THEM?

	Scientist:   BY HELPING THEM IN THIS CASE WE SAVE OURSELVES...

	A great outcry is heard in the studio. The camera bobbles
	around. The scientist is fumbling for words.

609	Stephen:	GOOD GOD.

610	In the other room, Peter sits against a wall. He can hear the
	television. His eyes stare straight ahead at something.

	Scientist:   I'M PROPOSING THAT CERTAIN...NECESSARY MEASURES
			BE PUT INTO EFFECT AT ONCE...MEASURES APPLYING TO
			ALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS, WHILE
			THEY'RE STILL OPERATIVE...HOSPITALS...RESCUE
			STATIONS...AND ANY...PRIVATE CITIZENS...

	The camera pulls off Peter's face. We see that his rifle is
	stretched across his lap. The TV drones on from the other room.

	Scientist:   IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P.
			THE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE
			DELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION
			IN REFRIGERATED VANS...THEY SHOULD BE DECAPITATED
			TO PREVENT REVIVAL...

	We see now what Peter is staring at. On the floor, twenty feet
	away lies the corpse of Roger. It's face is covered with a
	blanket. It lies very still.

	Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION...THIS COLLECTION...

	The man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from
	the studio. The angry staff protests vigorously, with
	emotional language...

	Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED...
			FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY...

	The shouts of anger continue.

			IN AN ATTEMPT...IN AN ATTEMPT TO CURB THE SENSELESS
			SLAUGHTER...THE SENSELESS SLAUGHTER OF OUR OWN
			SOCIETY...

	Suddenly the dead Roger's foot seems to move under the blanket.
	Peter's eyes pick up the movement immediately. His hands
	tighten on his weapon.

	Scientist:   THE DISSECTION...THE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN
			BE CARRIED OUT...CARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE
			DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY...

	Roger's arms seem to move, in slight twitching motions...

			THE HEADS...THE HEADS AND THE ...SKELETONS...
			WHENEVER POSSIBLE...COULD BE IDENTIFIED AND...
			AND BURIED IN CONSECRATED GROUNDS...

	The commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch.

	From the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off
	Roger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief.
	The blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling
	mouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into
	his super-gun.

	Suddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at
	first, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper
	who calmly raises his weapon...

611	On the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at
	the tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is
	shouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with
	his sleeve...

	Scientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL...
			RATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL!

612	Steve:	THEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY...

	Fran:	IT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT...

	BLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran
	startles and falls into Stephen's arms.

613	Roger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the
	Bank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms
	and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a
	Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar
	gunshot wound in Roger's forehead.

	The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which
	echoes through out the mall.

614	A small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table.

	Fran:	ADAM! NO NO!

	The woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal.
	She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid
	out in an unused part of the storage area.

	Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her
	brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the
	living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress
	which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near
	the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along
	with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee.

615	In the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable
	suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small
	portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator,
	and cabinets with dishes and silverware.

616	There is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months
	crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a
	stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings
	hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a
	wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence.

617	In the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with
	a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games.

618	On the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays
	tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new
	sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a
	sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his
	might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each
	shot with determination and emotion.

619	One of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off
	the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge.

620	In the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces
	several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies
	wandering this way and that through the area.

621	The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They
	moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be
	hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some
	clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched.

622	Now Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper.

623	The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space.

624	The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their
	supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen
	and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal.

	Fran:	THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS.
			WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP?

	Steve:	THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON.

	Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the
	TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table.

	Steve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on.
	Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The
	group has become a family, with all the disadvantages of
	comfortable living, including the inability to communicate.  

	Fran:	WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES?

625	The thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is
	hovering over the roof of the mall.

626	Fran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat.

	Steve:	OK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN...

627	The whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat
	unstable, but it eases down regularly.

628	In the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls.

	Steve:	EASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT...

	The woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as
	The chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface.

	Steve:	THAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT!

629	The runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles.

630	Fran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck.

	Steve:	YOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT...

	The woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy.
	She is bubbling.

631	Seen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks
	very small. Its engine dies and begins to whine.

632	A pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull
	away from a pair of beady eyes.

	Voice:	THEY MUST GET IN THROUGH THE ROOF.

	Voice:	SON OF A BITCH!

	Voice:	THERE'S TRUCKS BLOCKIN' ALL THE ENTRANCES.

	Voice:	NO SWEAT!

	Voice:	WHAT DO YA THINK? HIT 'EM NOW OR WAIT
			FOR TONIGHT?

	Voice:	TONIGHT.

633	We see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living
	space near the TV. A voice rattles over the unit:

	Voice:	WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE...SEEN THE WHIRLYBIRD
			ON THE ROOF.

634	Fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal. Peter sits at
	the radio, not knowing whether to send. Steve listens.

	Voice:	HEY, ER...COULD YA USE SOME COMPANY IN THERE?

	Steve is about to say something. Peter stops him.

	Voice:	WE'RE JUST RIDIN' BY...WE COULD SURE USE
			SOME SUPPLIES...WHAT'S THE CHANCE US
			GETTIN' IN THERE TO STOCK UP?

	Peter listens intently, trying to read the voice's inflections.

	Voice:	HOW MANY OF YOU IN THERE, ANYWAY...THERE'S
			THREE OF US. COULDN'T YA USE THREE MORE GUNS?

	Peter:	RAIDERS.

	Fran:	WELL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE, MAYBE WE SHOULD...

	Peter:	(cutting her off)
			NO CHANCE.

	The little puppy scrambles up to Fran's feet, seeking attention.
	She picks the little dog up in her arms.

	Fran:	WELL, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM...

	Peter:	WHO SAYS?

	There's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are
	heard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. They are
	obviously conferring among themselves. Steve starts to speak,
	Peter cuts him off.

	Peter:	SHHHH! QUIET!

	He is trying to hear the muffled conversation.

	Fran:	I THINK WE SHOULD...

	Peter:	JESUS CHRIST, SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

	More static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's
	face. The bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving.
	Finally, the voice again.

	Voice:	HEY...YOU IN THE MALL...YOU JUST FUCKED UP
			REAL BAD! WE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SHARE.

	Instantly Peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.

	Peter:	COME ON, MAN...GET IT UP.

635	Under the cover of darkness, a pair of hands stores a microphone
	on a portable radio unit. The radio is in a small van which is
	cluttered with junk. An arsenal of weapons is strewn about.

636	We see several men, and a few women, huddling inside the van.
	They look like banditos. One even wears a Mexican sombrero. The
	men are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss-
	crossed on their chests. They are dirty and sloppily dressed in
	all sorts of surplus clothing.

637	Outside, in close-up shots, hands turn controls on big motor-
	cycles and feet stomp accelerators. The bikes roar, creating a
	thunderous sound. Clouds of dust and fumes rise into the air.

638	Peter and Stephen are running across the mall roof. The roar of
	the cycles can be heard in the distance.

639	Reaching the roof's edge, Peter stares off at the horizon, but
	sees nothing. The thunder draws nearer. Peter tries binoculars.

640	Through the lenses are vague shapes in the darkness. As the
	sound swells, we see the riders. Their powerful bikes come
	charging over a rise...two...then three more...three more...
	more...

	They are accompanied by two small vans. There are at least
	fifteen bikes. The sound is deafening.

641	Peter:	JUST THREE, HUH?

	Steve:	HOLY SHIT!

	Peter:	THEY'LL GET IN. THEY'LL MOVE THE TRUCKS.

	Steve:	THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOSE CREATURES DOWN THERE.

	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL ARMY.
			LOOKS LIKE THEY BEEN SURVIVIN' ON THE ROAD ALL
			THROUGH THIS THING...DAMN! HOW MANY OF THE
			STORES ARE OPEN?

	Steve:	I DUNNO...SEVERAL OF 'EM...

	Peter:	WELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON!

642	The men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the
	convoy can now be heard in the living space.

	Fran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes
	on ahead through the door onto the firestairs.

	Fran:	WHAT'S HAPPENING?

	Steve:	THERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM...
			WE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES.

	Fran:	STEPHEN!

	Steve:	WE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES.
			THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE.

	The man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the
	puppy which goes running after the men floppily.

	Fran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage
	area and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle.

643	Outside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the
	darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders
	fire their guns, dropping several of the creatures.

	The mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders
	leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot.
	Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them.

644	The lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot.

	Raider:	 THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US...
			THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN...

645	The other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two
	bikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women
	jumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine.

646	The Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob
	at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat.

647	In the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor.
	He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he
	breaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen.

	Peter:	(shouting)
			DOWNSTAIRS FIRST...

	Steve:	OK...

	Peter:	GOT YOUR TALK BOX?

	Steve:	YEAH.

	Peter:	KEEP IS HANDY.

648	Outside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The
	bikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some
	of them whoop and holler like American Indians.

649	The van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them
	are knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three
	men pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the
	area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The
	woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her
	window. She squeals back to the main biker group.

650	The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of
	motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They,
	too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great
	noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind
	the bikes. The men still whoop and shout.

651	On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming
	roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through
	the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside.

652	At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies
	that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables.

	Raider:	 SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY
			FOR US...

	The man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at
	windows.

653	Inside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the
	Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department
	Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second
	floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store.

654	The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of
	victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not
	yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other
	entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot.

655	Across the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run
	on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They
	run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures
	fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by
	the ghouls. His friends pay no attention.

656	One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked.
	He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the
	mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm
	units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal.

657	Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he
	hears the alarms go off.

658	One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and
	sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his
	machine gun.

659	Peter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him
	and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below.

660	Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a
	dash for the Department Store.

661	The raiders spot him as well, and open fire.

662	Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks
	into the shadows leaving the gate open.

663	Peter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the
	bikers.

664	One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in
	his chest.

665	The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight.

666	Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store.

667	The bikers toward the building. Zombies scatter on the lot.

668	Just as the bikers are reaching the building, the raider inside
	rushes the doors. He holds them open as the big fleet of
	rumbling cycles comes screaming into the building.

669	Steve is in awe, watching from the Department Store grid.

670	The cycles pull down the concourse and Zombies lumber in after
	them. The raider at the door is grabbed by a Zombie. Then
	another. He manages to fight away.

671	Peter, shooting above, downs the raider and one of the ghouls.

672	The main band of bikers hear the gunfire and pull down a side
	concourse to regroup. They make their turn close to the
	Department Store and Steve backs into he shadows.

673	Peter moves down the balcony as Zombies are clamouring back to
	the big concourses. Peter's eyes are wide at the invasion.

674	Upstairs, Fran hears the noises. She is at the top of the
	firestair, weapons ready. On the landing below, the puppy
	scamper and barks. Fran calls the dog, but it doesn't listen.

675	The bikes arc around and several pull up to the Dept. Store.

	Raider:	 ALRIGHT...COUPLE OF YOU HOLD OFF THEM ZOMBIES...
			CHARLIE?...HIT THE GATES...WE GOTTA GET THAT
			SNIPER.

	The leader rolls out. Others follow. Peter fires and drops a
	raider, his bikes flying into the approaching Zombies.

676	The action is too fast and furious. Neither Peter or Steve can
	see the whole layout of the concourse.

677	The lead bikers pulls out of range behind a set of columns. A
	couple of bikers dismount and start up the stationary stairs.

678	Steve talks into his walkie talkie:

	Steve:	THEY'RE COMIN' UP, PETER...THEY'RE COMIN'
			UP THE STAIRS.

679	Peter moves to another spot on the balcony.

680	Suddenly the raiders at the Dept. Store door turn a machine
	gun on the roll gate locks. One flies open...another...

681	Steve runs into the store, about to charge up the escalator when
	he realises he'll be in the line of fire. he runs to the
	elevator, hits a button, and starts for the second floor.

682	Peter fires and drops one of the charging men on the balcony.
	The other takes cover. Just as Peter is changing position, the
	lights in the building blink out...the escalators stop... the
	power has gone off.

683	Upstairs, Fran is alone in total darkness. Below, she hears the
	puppy still barking. She starts carefully down the steps.

684	In the stuck elevator, Steve gropes and fumbles for his talk box.

	Steve:	PETER...PETER...

685	The big trooper charges through the darkness to the Maintenance
	corridor, ignoring the buzzing on his talk unit.

686	The raiders on the balcony approach quickly, ducking against the
	walls occasionally for cover.

687	The other bikers spill into the Dept. Store, raiding the
	counters and raping the displays. They throw things into sacks
	while others move to different stores and shoot off roll gate
	locks. They raid the arsenal in the Sporting Goods store.

688	The main pack of bandits are holding off the Zombies. The
	creatures charge with new vigour. Some raiders fall and the
	ghouls pounce on them, ripping flesh with teeth and hands.

689	The van pulls up outside the doors and two bikers ride out to
	it, loading supplies into it. The Zombies are everywhere, but
	the actions of the professional looters befuddle them.

690	Several creatures move onto the balcony. One Zombie pounces the
	raider Peter shot and tears at his body.

691	As remaining raiders appear at the mouth of the corridor, Peter
	opens fire, killing the lead raider with a clean shot in the
	heart. The man flies back over the railing, falling to the
	concourse below where Zombies attack it. The other raider falls
	back against the wall.

692	Peter dashes into the Maintenance Room and rushes to throw the
	emergency power switch.

693	The portable emergency light units blink on all over the mall.

694	Steve, who has crawled through the escape hatch of the elevator,
	suddenly feels the car move. He grabs onto the cables but his
	hands slip from grease and his rifle falls down and wedges
	between the wall of the shaft and the moving car.

	Suddenly, the car stops again, and Steve sees through the
	escape hatch as light spills in as the main elevator doors open.
	He thinks to jump down, but hears raiders below.

695	Two of the big, greasy bandits charge into the car. They whoop
	and shout as they see the open escape hatch.

696	Steve settles back out of sight against the wall.

697	Raider:	 COME ON, MAN...LET'S GO...

	The other raider whoops loudly and fires a barrage of bullets
	into the escape hatch.

698	The shells bang and clatter in the shaft and ricochet off the
	walls and gears. A shell nicks Stephen's arm, but he is silent.

699	Finally, the barrage stops. The raiders charge back to the
	store.

700	Other bandits battle with Zombies. The men crash through
	stores, collecting weapons, ammunition, tools, clothes, food.

701	Bikers shuttle goods out to the side doors of the van. The
	woman in the front seat is ready with giant pistols. Zombies
	try to pound their way in, but they cannot succeed.

702	In the mall, another biker drops to the Zombies. They pounce
	on him and start devouring his screaming body.

703	Several creatures now wander through the Department Store,
	having entered from the second storey gate. They move through
	aisles knocking against displays. One grabs a mannequin thinking
	it human, throws the dummy aside roughly.

704	The raider on the balcony is approached by several Zombies. He
	runs down the corridor to the Maintenance office. Peter is gone.
	Breaking into the various empty offices, the raider comes to the
	fake wall panel and assumes it goes nowhere. Then he hears the
	faint barking of the dog. He checks the panel again by running
	his hand along the edge.

	Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns. There
	are three ghouls coming. He fires and knocks off the ghouls one
	at a time and runs onto the balcony.

705	Bikes roar this way and that. It is a war zone.

706	The man is about to run downstairs when he hears a noise above.
	He spins and looks up. He sees Peter just too late.

707	The big Trooper, in an open ceiling grid, aims his super-gun
	squarely at the raider's head. The gun roars and the man flies.

708	Below, the raiders are starting to regroup. The bikes begin to
	peel out of the mall entrance one at a time.

709	Another raider is snatched off his machine by the Zombies.

710	The bikers toss a last bit of booty in the van and the woman
	driver gets ready to pull out. She lowers her window and fires
	point blank at the heads of the clutching creatures.

711	The last wave of raiders is at the first floor entrance. The
	Zombies are mobbing around the bikes outside. The men shoot and
	beat their way to the cycles. One man is brought down, but three
	manage to mount their cycles. The big bikes roar out.

712	Peter is crawling through the ductwork. Just as he opens a grid,
	he sees the last bike rolling across the concourse. He levels
	off with his scope.

713	He shoots one raider out of the saddle. Two others get out.

714	Regrouping in the lot, the band of twenty is now seven or eight.

715	One last cyclist revs his engine and roars through the
	concourse. He dodges several ghouls and heads for the entrance.
	He is the leader. The one who was on the radio. He whoops
	victorious just as he is about to drive through the doors.

716	Peter leans out of the grid work and settles the cross-hairs on
	the back of the riders head. He waits as the biker roars out
	onto the lot. The rider lets out one last victorious shout in
	the fresh air. Peter's scope is locked on the riders back and
	the super-gun roars. The biker is blown off his machine.

717	The bike flies into a pack of Zombies. Some fall back, but
	others advance on the rider. The man rolls over the cement,
	stops, not dead yet. He screams wildly as they move onto him.

718	The other bikers move off in the night and the engines fade
	away.

719	The puppy stops barking. Fran is tense in the darkness clutching
	her rifle. She stands on the now silent landing.

720	In the parking lot and main concourse the Zombies move freely.
	They fight over the remains of the corpses. They eat ravenously,
	the sounds of their feast the only thing in the area.

721	Peter peers down at the slaughter below from the ductwork.
	Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button.

	Steve:	PETER!

	Peter:	WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

	Steve:	IN THE ELEVATOR!

	Peter:	LISTEN, THOSE THINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
			CLIMB UP TOP...I'LL GET YOU OUT THE GRID ON
			THE SHAFT...I'M COMIN.

	Peter starts to crawl through the ducts.

722	Steve hits the second floor button and the car moves. He
	clamours up on the hand rail on the car. His hands reach up and
	grab the escape hatch pulling his head and shoulders out the
	opening. He kicks with his legs to force himself up when the car
	stops. He sees the grid in the shaft wall.

723	Suddenly, the car doors open on the second storey and abruptly
	several Zombies dart into the car. They claw at Steve's legs and
	pull him out of the hatch. He screams, thrashes violently.

724	In the duct, Peter hears the screams. He stops and listens for a
	moment. He backs away heading for the Maintenance corridor.

725	In the elevator, Steve thrashes with all his might. The ghouls
	try to pull him out of the car while the elevator doors open and
	close repeatedly against the creatures which block it.

	A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck. The man
	scrambles to unholster his gun. Although he is bleeding
	profusely, he finally pulls his gun and fires...once...twice...

726	Peter is dropping out of the washroom duct. He hears the pistol
	shots and realises Steve is not dead. He thinks about climbing
	back in the grid, but stops. He punches at the wall violently.
	He is angry and confused.

727	Again the pistol roars and rips through a Zombie head, flying
	out of the elevator. The doors still slam against the last
	creature and Steve fires. The Zombie flies back and the doors
	finally close.

728	Outside, Zombies fall against the elevator doors.

729	Inside, Steve falls to the floor. His neck runs red. His eyes
	are wide with terror. He sits stupidly staring at the pistol in
	his hand. He finds it hard to breathe.

730	Peter appears at the bottom of the firestair. The puppy runs to
	meet him, tails wagging and yapping. He hangs his head as Fran
	looks down.

	Fran:	NO.....NO!

	She runs down the steps. The big Trooper catches her bodily as
	she is about to charge out into the hall.

	Peter:	I HEARD HIS GUN...MAYBE HE'S ALRIGHT...WE'LL
			WAIT...WE'LL JUST WAIT A WHILE...

731	The mall stands silent in the blue haze of impending dawn.

732	Zombies move through the building freely, walking the halls,
	lumbering through the stores.

733	Several creatures still pound and scratch the elevator doors.
	As they push each other, one creature inadvertently makes
	contact with the elevator call button.

	The doors glide open. Steve is standing, his blood dry now.
	His eyes are blank as he steps forward. The creatures step
	away seeing that he is no longer prey...he is among them now.

	The doors slam against Steve and open again. Steve lumbers into
	the store down the aisle. Other creatures drift away.

734	Upstairs, Fran is packing her sack slowly and ponderously. Her
	face is red from crying.

735	Peter stands at the stair top looking down at the landing.

736	Fran sets the sack down at the escape ladder leading to the
	roof. She deliberately goes to fill another sack.

737	On the mall balcony, Stephen's corpse walks to the Maintenance
	corridor. He looks past other wandering Zombies and sees the
	fake partition. Something in him remembers. He moves forward.

738	Fran:	IT'S ALMOST LIGHT...LET'S GO.

	Peter looks at her silently from the stairway door.

	Fran:	HE DOESN'T ANSWER THE RADIO...IT'S BEEN HOURS...

	She starts to cry again.

	Fran:	FOR GOD SAKE. YOU BETTER COME ON BECAUSE IF
			I GET TO THINKIN' ABOUT THIS, I'LL JUST GO ON
			DOWN THERE AND LET THEM...LET THEM...

	The puppy suddenly growls. It charges between Peter's feet and
	runs floppily down the steps.

739	In the hallway, Steve pounds at the fake wall. Other creatures
	notice and they all move toward the partition.

740	Upstairs, the pounding can be heard. Peter stands stoically,
	looking down into the darkness. The dog barks below.

	Fran:	WHAT IS IT?

	Peter:	IT'S STEPHEN...THEY'RE COMIN' UP!

741	With a great crunching noise the partition gives way from the
	army of creatures.

742	Peter slams the door. He speaks quietly.

	Peter:	GO ON...YOU GET OUT OF HERE.

	Fran:	PETER...

	Peter:	I SAID...GET OUT OF HERE.

	From the firestair, we hear the sudden yelping of the puppy as
	it falls victim to the creatures. The sound echoes through the
	barren spaces of the storage area.

	Fran:	OH, JESUS, PETER...PLEASE...

	Peter:	I DON'T WANT TO GO...I REALLY DON'T...
			YOU KNOW THAT? I REALLY DON'T.

743	Suddenly, the door flies open and the creatures lumber into the
	living space. Peter stares at them. He smiles slightly. The
	creatures advance, led by Stephen.

744	Fran starts to scream.

	Fran:	STEPHEN...STEPHEN...

	She makes a slight move for her lover, but Peter raises his
	super-gun and shoots the Zombie through the head.

	As Stephen falls, Fran comes up short. The act startles her into
	awareness. Peter faces her as the creatures come up behind him.

	Peter:	MOVE, WOMAN!

745	Fran grabs the sacks and climbs the ladder to the roof.

746	The creatures advance on Peter. He backs away, trying to lead
	them from the skylight. They crash through the living space,
	upsetting the carefully planned room.

747	On the roof, Fran desperately starts the helicopter engine.

748	Peter backs into the storage room, slamming the door. The
	creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last
	time. The Zombies push through the door and move in for their
	feast.

749	Several zombies manage to scramble up the skylight to the roof.

	Fran stares, transfixed. The blades roar up to full speed.

	The creatures advance toward the machine.

	Fran steps out onto the running board; the creatures very close
	now. She crouches, watching for a moment, then looks up at the
	spinning blades.

	She stands straight up, driving her head into the spinning
	blades.

	A headless form falls to the roof. The Zombies advance.

750	In a wide shot, silhouetted against the dawn sky, we see the
	creatures huddled under the chopper blades, feasting on their
	last victim.

	The credits crawl up.

	Just as the credits end...

	the engine of the helicopter sputters...

	and dies.

DAY
OF
THE
DEAD
(The original script)
by George A. Romero



	FADE IN:

1	EXT. THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY

No people. A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles, abandoned. 
A TITLE FADES IN, one phrase at a time.

FIVE YEARS...
SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED.

2	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

We hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND. DEBRIS flutters through the 
streets. A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame, stops and looks 
around.

MONTAGE: as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets, knocking over 
GARBAGE CANS, upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW. 
A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK. LOOSE 
BILLS are dragged along under the animal's tail. They flutter away on 
the WIND.

3	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

GATORS crawl over A '79 CADELLIC. A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over 
the steering wheel. In the back a BABY'S BONES are strapped into AN 
INFANT'S SAFETY SEAT. One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly 
against the windshield. ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR:

FLORIDA - 1987

4	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

CLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH 
FOOTSTEPS approaching. A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame. 
It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man.

TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches 
THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail 
until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball 
in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, 
the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped 
away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE 
APPEARS:

DAY OF THE DEAD

5	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

HEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated 
by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander, 
without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings. 
The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human 
form, seems to be gone.

As the CREDITS END, we CUT TO:

6	EXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY

We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING 
is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been 
dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked 
clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its 
chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I 
LOVE YOU!

THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame.

7	EXT. THE STREET - DAY

We're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and 
SHATTERS as though made of potter's clay. BONES bounce over a wide 
area. THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND.

8	EXT. AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY

THE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water 
where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND.

Slowly, THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN.

9	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY

A FISHING BOATS, old and sea-worn, chugs into the harbour.

10	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

There are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like 
guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed, 
unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are 
obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes 
are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair.

TONY
Another dead place. I tol' you. Let's get 
out to the islands.

MIGUEL
The radio signals were coming from this 
area.

TONY
Not from the city. In every city it's the 
same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier 
islands. If there are survivors sending 
those signals that's where we'll find them.

MIGUEL
Plenty of time for the islands. The rest of 
our...life...on the islands...I think.

Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few 
inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes 
back toward reality.

MIGUEL
We gotta see if there are others here. We 
came all this way. We're gonna check it 
out.

11	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

CLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED 
BOAT. A WOMAN'S HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole.

The woman, MARIA, puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and 
sucks the air out.

At ANOTHER DERELICT BOAT, TONY sucks on ANOTHER HOSE.

TONY
Ptoooo! Nothing! Dry as a bone. No gas. 
Let's get outa here.

MIGUEL
Check them all. And check the tanks under 
the pumps.
	
MIGUEL and the other two guerilleros, SARAH AND CHICO, start to walk 
up the dock towards the harbour park, toward the city. MIGUEL has AN 
ELECTRONIC BULLHORN in one hand, his AUTOMATIC RIFLE ready in the 
other.

12	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

THE TRIO of refugees move across the grass. The WIND blows DEBRIS 
around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings. MIGUEL 
lifts THE BULLHORN to his mouth.

MIGUEL
HELLO. IS THERE ANYONE THERE? HELLO. 
HELLOOOOOOO....

13 	EXT. THE CITY - DAY

MONTAGE: as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE. Throughout the 
city they turned towards THE SOUND, at once confused and excited.

MIGUEL (o.s.)
HELLOOOOOOOOOOO....

THE DEAD start to GROAN hungrily, almost pleadingly. All over the 
city their VOICES RISE.

14	EXT. THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

It comes to MIGUEL AND THE OTHERS as A MASSIVE WALL OF NOISE, THE 
SOUND of hundreds-of-thousands of damned souls moaning on one solid 
voice. The sound of hell on earth.

15	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

TONY AND MARIA hear it as well and feel the familiar grip of cold 
fear. Maria makes the sign of the cross.

MARIA
Dios mia.

TONY
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead 
place. Like all the others.

CUT TO:

16	EXT. THE CITY (FROM THE WATER) - DAY

We see the place FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. In the FOREGROUND THE FISHING 
BOAT, with all five REFUGEES back on board, chugs into open waters.

CUT TO:

17	EXT.	A SMALL PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Away from the city, this dock is wooden, rickety. DERELICT BOATS rust 
at their moorings. THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier 
and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area, scavenging. This 
time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES. TONY lingers sullenly 
near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling.

MARIA'S SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER. 
She sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills 
her mouth.

MARIA
AY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA!

Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the 
trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the 
boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head.

TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to 
his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls.

With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She 
wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The 
man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the 
dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly.

MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking.

TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC.

BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER 
onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking 
desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD.

TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the 
fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman.

18	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS 
and look for cover.

They are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is 
a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the 
wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN 
FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups.

19	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING 
BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water.

THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to 
duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down.

20	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the 
frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN, 
STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open 
window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges 
at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF 
THE ARM six inches above the wrist.

MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes 
staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and 
almost certain death.

THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the 
air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster 
belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots.

THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell 
that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN 
MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature 
falls, destroyed.

21	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE 
out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at 
THE ATTACKERS on the trawler.

SARAH
I have to stop the infection... Querrida...
	
MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of 
primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH 
slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He 
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but 
he stays on his feet, still conscious.

CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of 
MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL 
still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL 
collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on 
the deck.

BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, 
starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and 
SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way.

22	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying 
for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She 
crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head.

THUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE 
BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND 
AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint 
the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES 
DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the 
blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE 
FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING.

Repulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE 
the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING 
OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again.

While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings 
herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears 
inside the place.

23	INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

The place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, 
life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE 
HANDLE.

THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its 
hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT 
THINNER from the floor beside the corpse.

From out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks 
violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the 
floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED.

SARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO 
THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.

24	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO ducks the enemy's RICOCHETING BULLETS.

CHICO
HEY ! WHAT ARE WE DOIN' THIS FOR? WE CAN 
STICK TOGETHER. WE CAN USE EACH OTHER'S 
GUNS.

At THE TRAWLER, ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response.

ATTACKER #1
You could use our guns, maybe. We can't use 
yours. Unless you can get yer boat back 
here.

CHICO
You got a boat.

ATTACKER #1
Shit, man. We can drift this tub into the 
bay...tow her around with a dinghy...but 
she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat 
you see here is long dead, soldier...else 
we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat 
back here?

CHICO
I don't know where they went, man. I don't 
know. I swear.

ATTACKER #1
Then, like I said...we can't use you. We 
ain't got the food nor the patience to put 
up with you.

The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic.

CHICO
YOU....YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!

He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES 
blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having 
wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.
	
She reaches into a shirt pocket and produces A WOODEN MATCH. She 
strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth. 
PHOOOOOMPH! The axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch.

25	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

As the gun battle continues, SARAH crouches over MIGUEL. BLOOD IS 
STILL FOUNTAINING FROM THE STUMP OF HIS LEFT ARM. The woman slaps THE 
FLAMING END OF HER TORCH ONTO THE STUMP. There's A SIZZLING SOUND as 
the raw flesh there cooks.

The pain reaches MIGUEL even though his unconscious state. He starts 
to breathe heavily. His head shakes from side to side silently 
pleading "NO, NO, NO." The flames do their job. THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER 
AND THE BLEEDING STOPS.

MIGUEL'S SHIRT CATCHES. Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams 
like the man on fire he is. He lurches away from the flame, his body 
slamming against the shed wall. SARAH flings the torch into the water 
and dives on top of the man.

SARAH
MIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO.

MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His 
body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his 
shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head 
against hers, rocking him back and forth.

26	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO is still busy RETURNING FIRE. BULLETS WHIZ through the air 
around his head. ONE KNICKS HIM ON THE SHOULDER, a superficial but 
painful wound.

CHICO
JESUS CHRIST! GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE 
HELL UP HERE!

SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as 
gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering 
violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet, 
takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS.

THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS 
CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH 
OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY...

It's THE FISHING BOAT! The WOUNDED MARIA is steering. TONY is 
standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING... 
RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!!

ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and 
HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the 
water below.

THE OTHER ATTACKER (#1) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN 
THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but 
he KEEPS FIRING.

THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise 
that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to 
scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he 
realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls.

MARIA
TONY....TONY....

TONY
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.

TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her 
own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.

27	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Behind the boathouse, SARAH slings her rifle onto her shoulder and 
she leans over MIGUEL who is now catatonic.

SARAH
Help me get him to the boat.

CHICO
Leave him.

SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.

SARAH
Help me or die.

Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag 
his limp body over the decking.

DISSOLVE TO:

28	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET

The fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon 
paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped, 
lumbering figures....ZOMBIES.

They're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE 
ATTACKERS.

THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY.

ONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK 
OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING 
RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a 
bothersome bit of bone.

29	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET

THE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers 
the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain.

TONY
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily 
sorry...for having offended 
Thee....offended Thee...

MARIA
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.

TONY
I detest all my sins...because... because 
of Thy just punishment... because of 
Thy...just...punish...

A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open 
cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the 
glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical 
trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.

MIGUEL
He is dying. I will end his pain.

MIGUEL draws his PISTOL.

MARIA
NOOOOOOOOO!

TONY
...but most of all because...they offend 
Thee, my God...Who art all good...and 
deserving...deserving of all my love...

MIGUEL
He is dying. He knows it.

MARIA
You are dying, too.

MIGUEL
No. The disease was cut away from me. I 
will live. I will live.

TONY
I firmly resolve...with the... with the 
help...the help of...of Thy grace...

TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of 
him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH.

MARIA
Tony...TONY!

The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give 
it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only 
the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing 
something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at 
TONY'S head.

MARIA
NO! YOU CAN'T!

SARAH
It must be done. You know this. It must by 
done to keep him from...

MARIA
It won't happen to him! It won't happen to 
him! You heard his prayer. His prayer will 
save him. He could never become one 
of...one of those... devils.

MIGUEL
Prayers have no power to save. The knife 
can save. It can cut the disease away. The 
bullet. It can shatter the brain where the 
evil takes seed. These are saviours...our 
new saviours...our only saviours.

MARIA
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. 
One day a dead man will... will...

MIGUEL
One day a dead man will refuse to return, 
and that man will be a saint. The first 
saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. 
A catechism. Something the priests tell us 
to believe.

MARIA
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you 
if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do 
it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to 
be done.

MIGUEL
No. You won't be able to do it. He will 
rise. He will rise and you... you will die.

That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his 
mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows 
concern.

30	EXT. DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHT

A CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water, 
its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes 
through it...CHUG-CHUG-CHUG.

31	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHT

CHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller. SARAH is asleep as well, and 
so is MARIA.

A SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail. HANDS reach out and grip 
MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter 
open.

TONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a 
second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His 
hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP. 
The woman screams.

SARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching 
all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good 
hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams 
shatter the quiet night.

At the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the 
AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder.

A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED 
TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC.

SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An 
instant later, CHICO FIRES as well.

THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each 
gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into 
MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling 
in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The 
corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking 
skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf. 

MARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail, 
grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH 
springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their 
hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH 
CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS.

CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and 
SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute. 
Visibility zero.

Silence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine.

MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE-
SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where 
TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE 
one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm.

THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them 
hitting squarely in the blood stain.

SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened 
eyes.

32	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (EST.) - DAY

It looks like a tropical paradise. Greatly separated from the other 
smaller islands on the horizon, its vegetation is dense and lush. 
There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power 
lines, no buildings. What meets the eye is all natural and inviting.

THE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side 
of the island.

33	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY

CHICO
It looks uninhabited. What do you think?

MIGUEL
I think we should burn the church. Kill the 
priest and burn the church. It's the only 
way. The only way.

MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE 
BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge 
now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original 
bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to 
prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and 
elsewhere.

SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too 
callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold 
like the eyes of a shark.

CHICO
I'm pullin' in.

34	EXT. THE ISLAND (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash. Tall reeds and cypress 
moss camouflage it completely. It's at though the boat is sailing 
right onto dry land.

SHOCK CUT TO:

35	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY

THWOCK! CLOSE ON A MACHETE. The blade chops into the top of a 
coconut.

CHICO drinks the milk. SARAH sits on a nearby rock, her RIFLE AND A 
BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders.

MIGUEL, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently 
from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant 
grows. There are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. Their 
red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells 
down.

MIGUEL
DATURA!!! DATURA!!! MIRA. DATURA!!!

CHICO
What's he saying?
	
SARAH shrugs, not knowing. CHICO looks down at her, empathising.

CHICO
His madness....could be from shock.

SARAH
No. I didn't stop the infection in time. I 
know.
(She speaks softly, matter-of-factly)
Don't worry. When he dies, I won't be like 
Maria. I'll shoot him.

MIGUEL
DATURA!!! DATURA!!! DATURA METEL!!!

36	EXT. THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY

THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with 
MACHETES. MIGUEL is ineffectual. He lags behind the others who are 
doing trailblazing. THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE, excited by the intruders, 
fill the close, humid air, sometimes beautiful, sometimes grotesque, 
sometimes startling.

37	EXT. A SWAMPY AREA - DAY

ALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds. A FOURTEEN FOOT 
GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM. CHICO 
draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand.

SARAH
No. No shooting. Not until we're sure we're 
alone on this island.

MIGUEL
No. No, thank you. No ice. Straight up, 
please. No ice. Thank you.

MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs 
him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the 
muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help.

38	EXT. THE SWAMP - DAY

THE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land. They flop him onto his 
back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips.

MIGUEL
NO ICE, I SAID!!! NOOOOO ICE!!!

He slams his good hand against the canteen, knocking it away. It 
plops into the marsh water, its contents lost.

MIGUEL
Burn the church. Kill the priest and burn 
the church. Burn....

His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out. He squirms 
for a moment, then he seems to fall asleep.

CHICO looks down at him. Unable to help, he moves off towards solid 
ground and disappears in the thick brush. After a time, SARAH follows 
after him.

39	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him. His eyes 
are wide, frightened by what they see.

In the ground before them there's AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE, fifty feet 
by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns.

SARAH
What is it?

CHICO
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I 
dunno.

Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons 
of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts 
to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the 
nearby jungle.

40	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

They take cover in a thicket, both their GUNS up and ready. OTHER 
SOUNDS can be heard now, clunking sounds of metal on metal, and a few 
heavy thuds. There are also VOICES on the wind but their words are 
indistinguishable.

CHICO
It's some kind of....elevator. There must 
be something under the ground 
here....maybe....military.

SARAH
Look.

41	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY

SEVERAL FIGURES are rising up in to view, a dozen, maybe fifteen. 
Details are obscured by FOREGROUND FOLIAGE but we can read helmets, 
heavy armaments, packs, utility belts. The impression is of a ghostly 
cadre of soldiers rising from hell.

SARAH (o.s.)
Jesus Christ!

CHICO (o.s.)
It is military. I don't believe it.

42	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or 
what?

SARAH
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better 
look.

She moves to another spot a few feet away. CHICO follows.

43	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR P.O.V.) - DAY

THE PLATOON OF SOLDIERS, still obscured by foliage, moves off into 
the jungle carrying A COLLECTION OF PARAPHERNALIA.

There are THREE SOLDIERS who do not move off with the others. They 
are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling 
listlessly from side to side. They have the body attributes of 
prisoners yet there's something menacing about them. We HEAR A SERIES 
OF ELECTRONIC BEEPS, something like computer beeps, and, as though in 
response to that signal, the three slumped figures start to walk. 
They move slowly, stiffly, their feet shuffling, their arms dangling 
lifelessly at their sides.

SARAH (o.s.)
Oh....oh, my God.

44	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

SARAH'S eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief, revulsion, 
horror. Beside her CHICO, also astonished, makes the sign of the 
cross.

SARAH
OH, MY GOD!!!

45	EXT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

As we CUT IN CLOSER we see that the three slumped figures are 
ZOMBIES. They are wearing khakis and they are armed with RIFLES AND 
PISTOL BELTS. Their HELMETS have been painted an identifying bright 
RED and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour.

All the others in the platoon are humans. They, too, wear vests but 
theirs are not red but WHITE, WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned 
front and back. Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for 
use should the ZOMBIES misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are 
shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co-
operatively, even somewhat excitedly....the kind of excitement seen 
in a puppy that's just learned a new trick.

46	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?

SARAH
Come on.

Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket, crouching 
all the while. CHICO hesitantly follows.

47	EXT. A CLEARING - DAY

The mysterious PLATOON begins "setting up" their equipment, which 
includes TRIPOD MACHINE GUNS. TWO MEN don BLACK RUBBER GLOVES AND 
LONG BLACK LABORATORY APRONS. They strap LARGE REFRIGERATED CARTONS 
around their necks and open the sealed lids. VAPOUR mushrooms out 
like dry-ice vapour out of Good Humour wagons on a hot day.

48	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH AND CHICO watch. Suddenly THE HUGE, FULL-THROATED SOUND OF A 
SIREN startles them. They look around, up into the trees. SARAH spots 
something and points.

CLOSE ON A SIREN HORN, high in the cypresses, its wires running down 
to the brush and disappearing under ground.

49	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

First ONE comes....then TWO MORE....THREE MORE. ZOMBIES are shuffling 
out of the jungle and converging on the platoon.

They seem to come from everywhere. Soon there are twenty or more. 
Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests, the same type as 
worn by the platoon. These are solid colours, some white, some blue. 
None are red and none have orange circles.

As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start 
growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the 
more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard.

The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the 
"Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men 
produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take 
the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat 
immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a 
more private supper.

50	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH
What is that? Could that be....?

Behind her, CHICO gets the dry heaves. He slams his hand into his 
mouth to keep from making noise.

SARAH
No. They must have gotten them to 
accept....other things. They wouldn't be 
feeding them with....they wouldn't...

51	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

The man in command of the platoon is obvious, strutting around while 
others do the dirty work. This is CAPTAIN RHODES. He's 
conscienceless, the low of the low, and a weasely-looking guy, to 
boot. He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble. (He loves 
to torture disobedient zombies.)

Behind him, their AUTOMATICS ready, are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially 
assigned to protect the captain. One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER, 
a good guy. TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing. He drops 
his head, almost gagging. RHODES notices.

RHODES
You'll get used to this, Tyler. It's the 
only way. They don't bite the hand that 
feeds.
	
TOBY looks up. He can't conceal his contempt for the captain. RHODES 
reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND 
distracts him.

ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok. THE ZAPPERS poke at the 
creature but that just makes it angrier.

RHODES
GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS!
BRING IT HERE!

ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END. He drops 
the noose over the wild zombie's head and the wire tightens, biting 
into the dead flesh on the thing's neck. The pole is long enough to 
control the creature while keeping it out of reach.

52	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH watches, repulsed but fascinated. CHICO is still fighting the 
heaves. Without warning, A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO. The 
man jumps forward, terrified. He crashes into SARAH who spins and 
sees the danger.

TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear. Then A THIRD. These have no vests. They're 
rag-tag, bad ass and hungry as hell. ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH. She 
manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics. He raises his RIFLE 
and...RATTATATTATATT!

53	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

RHODES hears the GUNFIRE. He seems pleased. He grins.

RHODES
We have visitors. Let's go men.

He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND 
SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of 
THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, 
like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a 
different pattern.

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go 
marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull 
apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.

RHODES
Hah! If only the rest of you ladies would 
obey orders the way they do.

54	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

Their cover blown, SARAH now raises her RIFLE. BUDDABUDDA!!!

THE SECOND ZOMBIE'S HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches 
forward, dead.

CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED.

Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE, from the clearing. BULLETS WHIZ 
through the brush. The guerilleros duck for cover.

55	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have 
OPENED FIRE. It's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. The creatures 
are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the 
stiff Army-issue triggers. BULLETS FLY this way and that, most of 
them grossly off target.

RHODES
THAT'S IT, YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME ! YOU FOUL-
SMELLING, PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS! I TOLD YOU 
I'D FIND YOU REAL ACTION, DIDN'T I? YOU 
CORRUPTION! YOU FILTH! YOU'RE LEARNING! 
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER....GETTING 
BETTER...GETTING BETTER, YOU SCUM!

The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is 
TRICKS. He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the 
captain and his zombie red coats. Their eyes tell us that they both 
think Rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.

56	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH moves to retreat but CHICO lifts his rifle and FIRES wildly 
into the clearing.

CHICO
NO! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

57	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT, but not in the head. Their brains keep 
functioning and they march on.
	
RHODES
SPREAD OUT, MEN! OPEN FIRE!

Whatever else he is, RHODES seems fearless. He stands in the open as 
his human soldiers fan out. He notices that the RED COATS are out of 
ammunition. He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS 
SOUND. THE RED COATS stop in their tracks. They dump the SPENT SHELLS 
from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts. 
Their fingers are stiff. Three bullets fall to the ground for every 
one that finds its way into a gun chamber.

The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW. They are closing in on the 
thicket.

58	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest. SARAH FIRES A QUICK 
BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into 
the jungle.

Suddenly, from right behind SARAH's back, comes A BLOOD CURDLING 
SCREAM. A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all.

MIGUEL
BURN THE CHURCH! KILL THE PRIEST!

It's MIGUEL, sweating, his eyes sunken into deep black sockets. He is 
charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one 
good hand. He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down.

59	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

MIGUEL breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the SOLDIERS. 
RHODES sees the one-armed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly. 
He draws his own PISTOL, an enormous Magnum, an elephant stopper.

SOLDIERS, taken by surprise, scatter, TOBY AND TRICKS among them. 
MIGUEL'S BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIER'S CHEST. He dies 
instantly.

MIGUEL
KILL THE PRIEST! BURN THE CHURCH!
BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN!

NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming, his GUN SPITTING.

ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down, HIT IN THE MID SECTION.

THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE.

MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST. He falls to his knees. His RIFLE 
FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun 
knocks him back on his ass. He sits there bewildered for a moment, 
then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES.

RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE. In the 
next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captain's stomach. 
RHODES' smile disappears, re-placed by a sudden flush of fear. He 
freezes.

MIGUEL
Kill the priest.

MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply. It's 
empty.

The captain's smile slowly returns. He pushes the "Attack" button on 
his belt unit.

THE RED COATS advance, their PISTOLS reloaded. THEY FIRE, stiff-armed 
and fumble-fingered, at MIGUEL. He sees them moving towards him. 
Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what 
they are...walking dead.

THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS. Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and 
reality gets even clearer. He starts to scream.

THE READ COATS walk closer, their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the 
sport. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH. ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD. 
He tries to stand up but he's too weak. A BULLET IN THE NECK stops 
his screaming. Then HE'S HIT IN THE HEART. A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS 
OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back, dead.

THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again. RHODES 
calmly pushes the "Reload" signal and the creatures obey.

MIGUEL'S CORPSE twitches for a short time, then goes rigid.

60	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH sinks against a cypress when she sees MIGUEL die.

CHICO, in a state of blind panic, takes off along the edge of the 
thicket, his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY.

61	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with 
TOBY TYLER'S GROUP OF SOLDIERS. He stops, reverses course, and ducks 
into a cluster of palms. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES. 
RATTATATTATATTATATT!!!

BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART. There's a scream and CHICO 
somersaults out into view. NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF 
HIS CHEST.

62	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape. She takes 
advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at 
a full run.

63	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO is still alive. He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before 
he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him. TRICKS tromps a boot 
on his hand. TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow.

CHICO
Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let 
me die this way...please. Destroy me. A 
bullet...in the head...I don't want to 
become...one of...one of them.

TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal 
ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His 
finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES 
strides up behind him.

RHODES
Take his weapon, Tyler.

TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the 
captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..

RHODES
Take his gun, ass hole. He still has the 
strength to pull a trigger.

Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL.

CHICO
Please...senor...destroy me...one 
bullet...please.
	
RHODES
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. 
Then....maybe...I can help you out. String 
him up.

THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under 
the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is 
moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's 
pain.

RHODES
They can handle it, Tyler. You've been 
buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's 
one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. 
Cut the heads off and get the bodies 
underground to the refrigerators. Fast. 
It's a hot day.

TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards 
the clearing. RHODES watches him go.

64	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD. 
RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket.

RHODES
Tyler. Just our men. Not him.

TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero.

RHODES
His head stays where it is. He and I never 
really had the chance to get acquainted. 
When he comes back...I'll get another shot 
at it... Ha ha ha ha...

65	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON CHICO. He's dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall 
tree, his feet ten feet off the ground.

ZOMBIES wander here and there. They've all received their rations. 
The picnic is breaking up now. Occasionally one of them gets surly 
but it doesn't amount to anything. SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC 
PRODS, OTHERS with GUNS.

PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away. MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the 
direction of the elevator.

RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging. He's careful not to 
step in too close. He doesn't want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his 
uniform.

CHICO
Please....shoot me.

RHODES
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back 
after your death. You'll come back and find 
yourself hanging there...wanting to 
eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate 
that thought, don't you? That's the 
ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't 
it?

CHICO is weeping now. With a found spurt of energy he struggles 
against the rope. No use. It only brings pain.

RHODES
After hanging up there a few days you will 
be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for 
it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!

CHICO
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! 
SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!

RHODES
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are 
on the island?

CHICO
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
(He nods towards MIGUEL'S CORPSE.)

RHODES
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your 
headquarters? On the mainland?

CHICO
The mainland...is dead...a dead 
place...nobody there...

RHODES
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me 
or I'll let you hang there 
forever...FOREVER!

CHICO
There are no...headquarters. There are 
no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't 
you see. They have won.

RHODES
Then why did you come here?

CHICO
To look...look for a place...a place to 
live in...an empty place...a... 
new...place...

RHODES
How did you know we were on this island? Do 
others know? Will others come?

CHICO
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no 
others...no rebels...nobody...it's 
over...it's ooooo....

The man collapses, unconscious.

66	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON THE DISEMBODIED HEAD OF ONE OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS. TRICKS is 
dropping the thing into A LARGE PLASTIC BAG which obviously already 
contains THE SECOND HEAD. TOBY wraps the mouth of the bag and begins 
to walk off. RHODES stops him.

RHODES
Where are you going, Tyler?

TOBY
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the 
heads.

RHODES
No time for that. I'll take care of them.

TOBY
Just....following procedure, sir. They're 
entitled to burial.

RHODES
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave 
them there. Go help with the rest of the 
gear.

RHODES has it in for TOBY (we'll find out why later), and of course 
the feeling is mutual. TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and, 
seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. TRICKS 
follows.

After a moment, RHODES motions with his head. THE SOLDIER WITH THE 
LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE, the one that 
ran amok earlier. The man follows RHODES towards the jungle, dragging 
the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's 
neck.

67	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE: as RHODES' GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE into THE CAPTIVE 
ZOMBIE'S gaping mouth. THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE releases the noose 
and the two men take off, running.

68	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

They run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to 
watch. RHODES lifts A PAIR OF BINOCULARS that are strapped around his 
neck. He stares through the lenses, focusing, grinning.

69	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: We see THE ZOMBIE staggering in the bush, 
clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth.

70	EXT. THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY AND TRICKS are the only ones who seem to notice what RHODES has 
done. TOBY drops THE CRATE he was going to carry off. He stares in 
disbelief, hatred on his face.

71	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

WIDE SHOT as THE HEAD OF THE ZOMBIE DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE GRENADE 
EXPLODES.

72	EXT.	THE CLEARING - DAY

RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle.

Suddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the 
binoculars and spins around. He sees...

...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's 
dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain.

RHODES
WHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?

SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands 
quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the 
captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in 
his eyes.

RHODES
Goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who 
fired that shot or I'll have every last one 
of you chopped up for feed!!!

His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his 
rifle slung.

RHODES
Step up here, Tyler.

TOBY
Sir!

TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps 
forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.

RHODES
You fired that shot, didn't you?

TOBY
No, sir.

RHODES
Let me see your weapon.

TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.

RHODES
It's been fired.

TOBY
In the battle, sir.

RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out 
to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.

RHODES
It may be that none of these chicken-shits 
will talk while the whole troop is 
present...but I know some of these men 
well. I'm sure that a few private 
conversations will tell me what I already 
know. You may have earned yourself some 
time in the Stalag, Tyler.
(Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body)
Cut him down. That's another head for you 
to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take 
the rest of his body down to the freezers. 
Move it, shit hill.

TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.

CUT TO:

73	INT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

There's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're 
inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete 
bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous 
hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from 
the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to 
unload their paraphernalia.

74	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING

SARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle 
branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has 
dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water, 
decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth.

The NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH 
look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A 
PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground 
beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN 
ITS ANKLES AND FEET.

SARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She 
unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing 
up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle.

75	EXT.	THE JUNGLE - EVENING

WHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream 
but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth.

JOHN
It's alright. It's alright. Don't be 
afraid. We're friends.

SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, 
a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes 
that seem instantly trustworthy.

JOHN
There are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll 
take my hand away if you won't scream.

SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing 
behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease-
covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy 
from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face 
who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf 
mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's 
get outa here!" with her hands.

JOHN
Right. We better get away from that Bee. He 
might have friends.

THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that 
all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw 
on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.

76	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENING

THE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to 
chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move.

JOHN
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the 
walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.

 SARAH
Gasparilla?

JOHN
He was a pirate who sailed these waters 
long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these 
days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.

SARAH
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?

JOHN
That's the man. He's been holed up here 
ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and 
his family owned these islands 'round here. 
They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The 
whole underneath is dug out. There was 
missiles here and laboratories and bomb 
proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. 
Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... 
private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his 
cronies from all the best golf courses in 
Tallahassee...and his private army, of 
course.

SARAH
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. 
There were actually walking dead...in 
uniform...with guns.

JOHN
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They 
could sting, sister. We know you came up 
against 'em. We been watchin' you since you 
landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. 
We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was 
spotted it could....well, it could be the 
end of everything.

SPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their 
tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a 
Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and 
peers through.

77	EXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING

There's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE 
STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. 
They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES.

Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE 
LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue.

Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing 
white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY 
HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a 
lot more about her later.)

THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the 
direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this 
but JOHN calms her with a strong hand.

SPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S 
SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for 
good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another 
swallow from his flask.

THE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort.

Finally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the 
bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut.

The moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. 
THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have 
spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE-
LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an 
attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes 
it away from her.

JOHN
Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind 
me.

(SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat 
insulted.)

You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught 
not to touch the ones with the circles. 
There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time 
rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they 
leave us alone. The colour on their vests 
tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's 
the ones without colours you gotta watch 
out for.

SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He 
reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his 
back.

THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. 
ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the 
bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking.

ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, 
growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes 
two angry steps towards the humans who back away.

THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away 
and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. 
BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN 
BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes 
rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground.

McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his 
flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but 
nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty.

McDERMOTT
Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength.

JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of 
the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.

SARAH
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.

JOHN
I know you can. Like I said, we been 
watchin' you.

McDERMOTT
We better get as far away from here as we 
can. We can work the other side of the 
island tonight.

JOHN
(explaining) We found nine entrances to the 
Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole 
thing near charted yet. That's what we was 
doin' out here today. Huntin' for 
entrances.

McDERMOTT
Come on. They find a Bee done like this and 
they'll know somebody's been out walkin' 
where they shouldn't have been.

JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We 
can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the 
good words over the corpse of the "white-coat".

SARAH
The man I was with...until today... 
believed that praying was for blind men who 
couldn't see the truth.

JOHN
How we gonna break the curse without a 
prayer or two.

SARAH
Curse?

JOHN
What is it if it ain't a curse?

SARAH
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite 
that infects the brain.

JOHN
That sounds like a curse to me.

SARAH
We thought we were escaping here. We 
thought we'd found an uninhabited island. 
Christ! This place is a worse nightmare 
than anything I've seen yet!

JOHN
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why 
we're doin' what we're doin'. What's 
happenin' underground here is just what 
Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' 
man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're 
gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

SARAH
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus 
nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a 
bullet from one of those storm troopers and 
prayer won't keep one of those monsters 
from eatin' your liver for lunch.

JOHN
That's why we didn't use prayers on this 
here white coat 'til after he was 
destroyed. We ready to fight when we have 
to. And we gotta fight now.

SARAH
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been 
fightin' for what feels like a hundred 
years and I'm finished. I don't need 
religion. I don't need prayers. I need a 
couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail 
on outa here. Find another island where 
there ain't so much....traffic.

JOHN
You think you can find your boat? There's a 
thousand little inlets and backwaters all 
through here. You remember all the ways you 
turned to get where you are now? You leave 
yourself a trail?

SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not 
sure whether to believe him.

JOHN
We didn't see the exact spot but we know 
about where you landed. But we ain't ready 
to take you there. Not yet. You see...we 
need guns, too.

SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks 
for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the 
jungle.

SARAH
I can find it myself. I didn't come that 
far.

JOHN
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. 
You will. And there's Bees all through the 
jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos 
don't lie.

SARAH
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. 
Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!

SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over 
her shoulder she disappears.

McDERMOTT
We can't let her go, John.

JOHN
We don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. 
(He's joking.)

McDERMOTT
The hell we don't! But that's not what I 
mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out 
there alone. That or she'll be firin' off 
her automatics and wakin' up the troops.

JOHN
We'll split up. Billy, you go with Spider. 
Just an hour or two tonight, that's all. 
Rhodes might have extra guards on after all 
the commotion. We'll meet up at number six 
and go back home together.

McDERMOTT
God save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll 
never make it.

THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through 
the darkening underbrush.

78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

DARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a 
velvet painting.

SARAH is moving cautiously. She bumps into something, jumps back, her 
MACHETE high, and freezes. Cautiously she moves ahead...one 
step...another...another...

SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER. 
She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water 
and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends 
down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away. 
SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD, 
ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She 
squints to see.

SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their 
very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman.

She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE 
FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It 
has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off 
length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the 
left breast.

SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It 
keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few 
yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She 
pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, 
topples off the ledge and into the water.

When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches 
towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The 
gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE 
that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and 
slime and looking pissed.

SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her 
AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the 
darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From 
out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade 
from the dead creature's head.

SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving 
in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like 
the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost 
swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process).

SARAH
Are you gonna pause to say words over the 
dead this time or can we be on our way?

Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH 
along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm.

79	INT. THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE on: A TELEVISION SCREEN. First there is only VIDEO NOISE, then 
an image blinks onto the screen.

MONTAGE: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout 
the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in 
groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes.

The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE 
CIRCLE VESTS. GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered 
harmlessly. GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and 
FIRED. The images repeat and repeat and repeat. THE ZOMBIES watch the 
scenes with dumb curiosity.

80	INT. COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

This is the central area for all varieties of communication. There 
are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO 
CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the 
panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much 
of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run 
every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the 
place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing, 
patching, trouble shooting.

Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of 
SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is 
MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two.

At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own 
VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave.

GUARD
There's activity in the dormitory!

MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move 
over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a 
prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. 
We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY 
reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-
BUTTON.

VOICE (o.s. - filter)
Gate twenty-three.

MARY
This is Mary Henried. Did anyone enter the 
dormitory?

VOICE (o.s. - filter)
Yes, ma'm. Captain Rhodes.

MARY clicks off, infuriated. She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by 
JULIE GRANT.

81	INT. THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND wearing A BLACK 
LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair. It's the 
head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand 
belongs to RHODES himself.

In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step 
forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT 
STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder 
height.

RHODES
Take it, friend. Take it. It's a present. 
From me to you.

THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD.

RHODES
Just remember who gives you favours.

THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the 
bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the 
rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, 
TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily.

On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in 
marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO".

RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. 
GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, 
growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old 
who needs to pee.

RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, 
tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins.

RHODES
Well, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss 
Henried's pride and joy.

RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly.

RHODES
Surly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, 
Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my 
sack here.

A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see.

82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH 
ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. 
The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. 
Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into 
A CELL marked "SAMSON!".

SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already 
gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing 
up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out 
grey matter.

JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as 
well and she reels away from the hideous sight.

RHODES
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen 
worse.

MARY
God....damn you, Rhodes!

RHODES
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities 
worse than yours?

MARY
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've 
been trying to wean these specimens onto 
alligator meat!

RHODES
No wonder they're so....hungry.

Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth.

THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, 
pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE 
FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle.

RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs 
the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT 
AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, 
ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR.

MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream 
but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical.

RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD 
IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet.

83	INT. MARY'S OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL, A DESK AND THREE 
CHAIRS. There's A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL 
X-RAYS.

MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair. RHODES stands cockily in the 
open doorway.

JULIE
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I 
didn't know that....de-caps... revived!

RHODES
Any dead whose brains are intact will 
revive.

JULIE
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must 
be torture for them!

RHODES
They are brutes without feeling. Though I 
admit that I've requested cremation for 
myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, 
even more ridiculous now than it ever was. 
To say nothing of the...spacing 
problem...on a small island like this.

JULIE
I thought the purpose of decapitation was 
to...to...

RHODES
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve 
as much...food...as possible. The purpose 
for feeding is to keep the beasts on our 
side. The fact that they can be taught to 
clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a 
convenient side benefit, not the primary 
goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves 
from becoming their supper. Keep them fed 
and they behave. Keep them hungry and they 
revert back to being the animals that they 
have always been. You saw them in there.

MARY
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!

RHODES
They will never be satisfied with anything 
else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. 
I'm prepared to take whatever steps are 
necessary to see to it they don't get mine! 
Not while I'm still using it!

JULIE has calmed herself down. Now she feels angry, betrayed. She 
looks at MARY accusingly.

JULIE
Did you know? About the de-caps?

MARY
I'd never seen it before.

JULIE
But you knew.

MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.

JULIE
What else is there, doctor? What else do 
you people know that the rest of us don't?

They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them 
has been severed forever.

84	INT. A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

There are CARDIOGRAPHS, E.E.G. MONITORS, AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL 
CONDITIONING DEVICES. On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED 
BLOCKS for dexterity testing. There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the 
walls, TRIANGLES, SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES.

MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. RHODES 
catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT.

RHODES
You can't run away from the planet, Miss 
Science. You can't even run away from the 
island, heh heh.

MARY
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her 
vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate.

MARY
You're....you're disgusting! 
You're....FILTH!

RHODES
And you're the one who builds the bomb and 
they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be 
used'.

MARY is stopped...by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself 
gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves 
toward the doorway where RHODES stands.

MARY
(calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a 
behaviouralist. She's not medical. She 
hasn't been as...exposed to...to 
things...as some of the rest of us. She'll 
be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be 
alright.

RHODES
Oh, I have no doubt.

MARY
(recognising threat in his voice) If you 
put her on the shit list because of her 
reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.

RHODES
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to 
favour you lately. I understand he assigned 
you a roommate of your choice. The rest of 
us have to pick names out of a hat. 

MARY
(reading his jealousy) Rhodes, you and I 
had a roll in the hay together when I first 
got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying 
experience which I do not want to, and 
which I never will repeat! So give up, 
mister! I'm going home...to that roommate 
you mentioned.

MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway.

85	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

MARY starts down the hall but RHODES grabs her from behind. He leans 
in close, lusting, pressing his lips against the back of her neck.

MARY
Take your hands off me! Right now!

An evil grin returns to RHODES' flushed face. He stares at the woman 
for a long moment, then he lets go. MARY walks away, bristling. 
RHODES calls after her.

RHODES
Maybe you'll change your mind when it 
starts getting too lonely for you.

MARY stops dead. She turns back to see him gloating.

RHODES
I'm not entirely without influence myself, 
Miss Science. I had your roommate 
assigned...by Gasparilla... to my platoon. 
What's his name? Tyler? Yes. Toby Tyler.

A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting 
her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.

RHODES
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him 
today. In fact...you might say that Mr. 
Tyler is in big trouble with 
the...authorities.

MARY
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd 
love to serve your balls to those Red Coats 
for lunch! Think about it!

RHODES
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs 
to do some thinking.

He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF 
RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the 
DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD.

86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL 
ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS 
RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES, 
CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to 
there.

MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made 
walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D.

87	INT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR 
THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING. 
PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he 
punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a 
door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. 
OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
filled room.

MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 
83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with 
RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside.

MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through 
the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER.

MARY
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find 
out what's goin' on.

TOBY
Hey. Slow down. What is it?

MARY
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.

TOBY
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his 
move so fast.

MARY
It's because of me.

TOBY
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is 
a prick.

MARY
I want you to leave. Then maybe...

TOBY
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. 
I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we 
can smuggle out one of those inflatable 
rafts. They're crated up real small. 
They've got air canisters. There's food 
inside. Even a little motor.

MARY
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm 
not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong 
that way. I need...

TOBY
Need what? Civilised order like we have 
down here? Christ!

MARY
I can work here. Maybe my work can 
help...help everyone. I can do more good 
with access to this equipment than I can 
off in some wasteland.

TOBY
For the good of mankind. That's what every 
monster-maker says.

MARY looks into TOBY'S eyes. She's hurt, yet angry. The kind of anger 
that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive 
guilt-nerve.

TOBY
We're gettin' out. Me and Tricks. I want 
you to come with us. I want that more than 
anything. I'll send word. I'll let you know 
a time and a place to meet. We probably 
won't be able to wait around so if you're 
not there on the dot...well...if you're not 
there, I'll know you're not comin'.

She grabs him, holding him tightly against her. They kiss, hard and 
long. TOBY pulls away, looks at her lovingly, then turns and starts 
toward the guarded apartment. MARY follows.

TOBY
(walking) I don't know what they're gonna 
do to me. I figure they'll just send me out 
to Stalag Seventeen but if...if it's worse 
than that...Tricks will know. Stay in touch 
with Tricks.

As they approach the door to number 83, THE SOLDIERS there raise 
their RIFLE to ready positions.

SOLDIER
You Tyler?

TOBY
Yes.

SOLDIER
You're under arrest. I'll take your weapon.

TOBY hands over his RIFLE and begins to unbuckle his PISTOL BELT. TWO 
MORE SOLDIERS appear from inside the open apartment.

MARY
What's he supposed to have done? What are 
the charges?

SOLDIER
Dunno, ma'm. We're on orders.

MARY
Look...I'm Mary Henried. I'm with the 
special conditioning center. I'm not 
without influence...

TOBY
(calmly) Mary.

MARY
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll 
have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand 
here and...

TOBY
(more insistent) MARY!

She gives up. She looks into TOBY'S eyes.

TOBY
I'll be alright. Just remember the things I 
said. Take care of yourself.

THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force. MARY watches 
their backs for a time, then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily 
into the open apartment. She begins to cry.

88	EXT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SIX - NIGHT

HATCHWAY NUMBER SIX is surrounded by PROTECTIVE FENCING and, from it, 
A FENCED ALLEYWAY runs off through the brush toward...we don't know 
what yet.

THE HATCH OPENS and TOBY, along with TWO OTHER PRISONERS, also 
disarmed troopers, is led down that alleyway by THREE GUARDS.

JOHN, SARAH AND BILL McDERMOTT peer out from nearby foliage. They 
watch the procession. John whispers.

JOHN
The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag 
Seventeen. That's where we live. That's 
where you gonna live, too. Hell's half 
acre. It's not a nice place. Them boys 
there is prisoners. What's their 
punishment? They sent out to the Stalag for 
a few weeks. That's punishment enough.

SPIDER seems to appear from nowhere. She motions and the others 
follow her through the thick jungle.

89	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

THE RUNNING FENCE LEADS TO A GATE IN A BIGGER FENCE. This one is 
ELECTRIFIED. We know this because we see A COLLECTION OF ZOMBIES, 
mostly "civilians" with no vests, clambering there, HANDS AND FACES 
SPARKING WHEN THEY TOUCH THE CHAIN LINKS.

THE ZOMBIES send up wild MOANS AND GURGLES when TOBY AND THE OTHER 
PRISONERS are led through the gate.

Inside the compound is A SCATTERING OF OPEN-SIDED MILITARY TENT-
BUILDINGS, resembling those on M*A*S*H. There's A DIN coming off the 
place, a mixture of MUSIC AND VOICES that forms a disturbed blanket 
of noise. The place seems to seethe like a hornets' next.

THE SOLDIERS head back for The Cave as POSTED GUARDS shut the gate 
behind THE PRISONERS. TOBY and the other captives move toward the 
"village".

90	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET - NIGHT

PEOPLE wallow in the mud. ONE MAN has just taken a shit and is wiping 
his ass. Nearby A DRUNK lies unconscious. SEVERAL MEN are fighting. 
It's a brutal fight with BOTTLES AND PIPES AND LENGTHS OF CHAIN. The 
men are really hurting each other. PEOPLE SMOKE AND SNORT AND SHOOT 
UP in wide open disarray.

A HUGE PREGNANT WOMAN plants herself right in TOBY'S path.

PREGNANT WOMAN
How 'bout it, baby. I'm big but I'm 
beautiful.

TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK.

DRUNK
HEY, YOU FUCK! YOU FUCK!

He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of 
the long huts. THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on, abandoning TOBY, 
disappearing into the crowd. THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED, HOME-MADE 
KNIFE.

DRUNK
I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP, YOU FUCK! YOU CAN'T 
PUSH ME AROUND LIKE... PUSH ME 
AROUND...LIKE...

Suddenly VOMIT rises in the man's throat and he doubles over. TOBY is 
aware of SOUNDS behind him. At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN, 
still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam-
bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. 
There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as 
though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged 
lips and blows TOBY a kiss that's meant to be seductive.

TOBY moves on down the street. The place is a cesspool full of human 
dregs, stinking with refuse, filled with the fury and desperation of 
man in his last days.

91	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

JOHN leads his followers to within sight of the Stalag gates. ZOMBIES 
still claw at the ELECTRIFIED FENCE. BLUE-WHITE SPARKS fill the air 
like flashbulbs.

JOHN
This is home, darlin'. Home for us that 
don't make the grade. Us that ain't...good 
enough to live inside The Cave. We grow a 
little food, do a little light 
manufacturin'...like these here vests, we 
make these for the massers. We live in our 
own filth, with bugs and snakes and disease 
and jungle fever...all the time waitin' to 
become breakfast for the Bees.

JOHN is doing a sales job on SARAH but everything he says is truth. 
She hears it all, softening to JOHN'S cause.

SPIDER has silently lifted A LARGE WOODEN ROUND out of the weeds. 
It's a camouflaged tunnel entrance.

JOHN
It's a tunnel. It's a couple hundred yards. 
Just keep goin' 'til you reach the end. 
I'll be right behind you.

SARAH starts down into the hole. JOHN and the others prepare to 
follow. JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make.

92	INT. THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

We see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS, each with A BODY lying on top. What 
faces we see are gaunt, showing the boils and lesions of consumptive 
diseases and tropical fever. INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the 
air.

An Oriental orderly, LUKEY, moves through the maze of bodies. He 
lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she 
is dead indeed. He hurries off.

93	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

This is a room with walls, an operating room with JURY-RIGGED 
APPOINTMENTS. On A TABLE, under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS, lies A 
CORPSE. Another orderly, a Nordic type names DIESEL, an enormous man, 
assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSE'S HEAD.

LUKEY rushes in out of breath.

LUKEY
Doc Logan! Doc Logan! Dere's a lady dead 
out dere! Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry! Dunno 
how long she been dat way! Maybe she 
gettin' ready to come back.

THE CORPSE'S HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY. DOC LOGAN picks up AN 
ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT. WHZZZZZZZZZ! HE DRIVES THE SPINNING 
BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD, DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN. When he pulls it 
out, MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down.

LOGAN is a middle aged man. He looks exhausted, demoralised, a bit 
mad. And he looks as ill as some of his patients. There are OPEN 
SORES on his face and he hasn't shaved for days. He's covered with 
two week worth of BLOOD STAINS. He starts around the table leaving 
DIESEL to dispose of the "DE-CAP".

LOGAN
Bury the head. Call the guard for the rest. 
Get it off the table for now. We'll bring 
this new one in.

DIESEL doesn't respond right away. He's heard something.

LOGAN
What is it?

DIESEL
The tunnel.

LOGAN hears it now, A SCRATCHING, SCUFFLING SOUND. He looks at his 
watch.

LOGAN
God. It's almost sun-up.

LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room. They remove 
SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor. SARAH'S head pops out, gasping 
for air. Logan recoils, his eyes wide and frightened.

LOGAN
Who are you? Who are you?

He stands up too quickly. Dizziness makes him reel. He smashes into 
AN INSTRUMENT CART, comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the 
thing threateningly aimed at the stranger.

JOHN
It's OK. It's OK, Doc. She's with us.

In the next moment, SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel.

JOHN
This here's the hospital. That's Diesel 
over there, the big guy. This here's Lukey 
and that's Doc Logan who's about to cut 
your tonsils out.

SPIDER, the last one to climb into the room, quickly begins 
collecting WEAPONS, what few the rebels have.

JOHN
This here's all the weapons we got. That's 
why your fancy automatic looks so good to 
us. We gotta stick it over here with the 
others for now. They catch us with any kind 
o' weapon and its death without even askin' 
your name.

SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN. The deaf mute signs something which 
SARAH can't decipher.

JOHN
Ammunition. You got ammunition in your pack 
there? I hope you do or the gun ain't worth 
much.

SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS 
AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS. JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD, 
MEDICINES, A KNIFE, A COMPASS...

JOHN
We better just hide the whole pack, 
darlin'. That stuff is just shoutin' out 
that it come from the mainland. The shit we 
get is all C.D. rations. Aspirins and 
crackers from 1958.

SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly. SARAH is a little 
disturbed by the action. THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS 
beside the tunnel entrance.

JOHN
Let's go. You look like you could use some 
shut eye. Me too. We can all get acquainted 
tomorrow.

LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main 
hospital area. BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask.

McDERMOTT
Doc, I need a fill up. I'll help m'self if 
it's alright with you.

LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which 
contains, among other essentials, SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY. He fills 
his flask eagerly.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

McDERMOTT
She's alright. Christ, Rhodes and his 
cossacks wiped out her whole party. Dan 
near got her.

McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask, takes a long slug from the 
cabinet bottle before putting it back, and moves out of the room. 
LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

LOGAN repeats his question, intoned identically as it was before. 
He's twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face. THE 
THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER.

DIESEL
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look 
real bad.

LOGAN
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone 
in the world has looked bad for four years. 
Thank God looks don't matter as much as 
they once did.

LOGAN, a wild gleam in his eye, moves out of the room, following 
where the others went, that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his 
hand. The others follow.

94	INT. THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

JOHN, SARAH AND LUKEY are facing out across the compound. A TEEMING 
TROPICAL RAIN has started to fall.

JOHN
This just ain't your day, is it, darlin' 
Sarah.

SARAH can't help but snicker. Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is 
conquering her body as last. JOHN puts a big arm around her.

JOHN
Three more minutes. Then you can sleep. You 
gotta stay with it for three more minutes.

McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain. LUKEY 
waddles back through the maze of cots.

LOGAN, SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big 
room. The patients around them, their eyes bulging, look like lemurs.

LOGAN
How do we know she's alright? How do we 
know?

The same intonation again. This guy's wrapping is definitely coming 
loose.

THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGAN'S back. It's the woman whose wrist 
Lukey checked earlier. Its teeth are dripping with drool, its hands 
reaching out wantingly.

LOGAN turns around. Calmly, but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake, 
he shoots out the hand that's holding THE SCALPEL. THE BLADE SINKS 
DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes 
again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, 
thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on 
his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes 
in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice.

95	EXT. STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET (RAIN) - NIGHT

THE STREET SCENE is toned down due to the late hour and the rain, but 
just as vile, just as vicious. JOHN AND McDERMOTT escort SARAH. JOHN 
speaks softly, and only when others on the street are far enough 
away.

JOHN
They supply us with disinfectant and dope. 
Sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. What more 
could anyone ask for? Most around here 
ain't interested in changin' their lives. 
The folks you met...me and them and a 
couple others is the whole rebel army. 
Nobody else gives a shit...and they're 
afraid o' Rhodes.

They pass A STRUCTURE WITH AN OVERHEAD SIGN that reads: JOE'S CORNER 
TAVERN. If there were walls they'd be pushed out by the MASS OF 
HUMANITY inside. MUSIC BLARES and VOICES form a wall of noise louder 
than the THUNDER. A FIGHT spills out onto the muddy street, PUSHERS 
selling all sort of delights accost JOHN and his group.
	
SARAH
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some 
punishment.

JOHN
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a 
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer 
veins. You get lost out here and nobody's 
gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It 
all makes for food in the freezers.

They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads: THE RITZ.

JOHN
This is your hotel. I'm not gonna stay here 
with you but I'll always be close. You 
gonna hafta take care o' yourself like you 
said you was able to do.

SARAH nods. JOHN smiles at her. His warm, trustworthy eyes seem to 
glow in the dark.

JOHN
Some may notice that you're new. Just deny 
it. You'll get away with it. Nobody really 
looks at each other around here. Go on in. 
Get some sleep.

He squeezes her hand tightly, then he turns away and moves off with 
McDERMOTT. SARAH moves into THE RITZ.

96	INT. THE RITZ (RAIN) - NIGHT

It resembles the hospital. There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS. SOME 
PEOPLE SLEEP, alone and in pairs. OTHERS are awake, drinking, 
screwing, shooting up. SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down. 
Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from 
the electrified fence. RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesn't keep her 
from falling asleep.

97	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

TECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready. 
We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT. Under supervision, the thing is fumbling to 
tie a shoelace. It's failing miserably but trying hard. ANOTHER BLUE 
is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A 
BOARD.

TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS. We've 
seen these zombies before, in the dormitory. TONTO, is...or was...a 
native American, probably Seminole. In front of him is A PLATE 
containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT. He has A FORK in his hand and he is 
idly stabbing at the meat.

The other RED COAT, BLUTO, looks just like Bluto from Popeye, bulky 
with a thick, black beard. Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE he's working 
on, he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTO'S plate. He 
snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth. As soon as he tastes 
it, however, he pulls it back out, dribbling and spitting 
disgustedly.

FISHER (a technician)
They won't accept a substitute. They want 
their Alpo.

TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat. He moves it to his 
mouth and pops it in.

FISHER
Alright! Way ta go, Kemosabe!

MARY HENRIED has entered the room. She pulls up and watches  TONTO 
with a kind of dubious interest. TONTO stops chewing. He looks up 
with exaggerated sadness on his face. Slowly his mouth opens and the 
chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips. He throws his fork 
down angrily.

MARY
They won't learn to use forks if they don't 
like the breakfast you're serving, Ted.

FISHER
The fork is like a game to them. If they 
get into the game maybe they'll learn to 
like the food.

MARY
It won't work.

Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table. He flings his chair aside and 
tromps right over to MARY. His arms are outstretched and he is making 
a pleading, Karloff-like SOUND. GUARDS come after him but MARY waves 
them off.

MARY
It's alright! Leave him alone!

MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake 
vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. 
His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS 
lead him away.

98	INT. THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING

BLAM!!! A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS.

CLOSE ON: A TARGET, a flat, cut out silhouette of a man, BLACK 
TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones, brain, heart. BULLETS 
STRIKE the neck, the to torso, SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind. 
None hit the kill-zones.

MARY HENRIED enters. The place resembles a Police Department target 
range. RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS 
which pop up against the opposite wall. THE NOISE is deafening. TWO 
TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score. MARY walks 
up to one of them.

MARY
Have you seen Julie Grant this morning?

TECHNICIAN
She should be in the behaviour rooms.

MARY
She's not. Hasn't shown up yet.

There's AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN, the sound of a zombie trying to 
communicate. MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing 
in the closest stall trying to attract MARY'S attention. (He was the 
one Rhodes referred to last night as "Mary's pride and joy".) He is 
wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both 
his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military 
salute.

MARY
Good morning, Bub.

BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean 
something to him. Then he, too, salutes. MARY pulls away, heading for 
AN EXIT, but BUB calls after her. He makes inarticulate sounds but we 
catch his drift.

TECHNICIAN
I think he wants you to watch.

MARY
OK, Bub. Do your stuff.

BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter on a 
western street. There's A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND. KATCHUNG! A 
SILHOUETTE pops up. BUB slaps leather...fast... lighting fast. BOTH 
GUN come up. BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!!!

HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGET...WOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP!!! All in the kill-
zones, or damn close.

BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER. He clicks open the shell-
chamber on THE OTHER, dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload 
from his belt.

MARY stares at the creature's back, mixed emotions showing on her 
face. BUB turns to face her. Dropping a bullet, he salutes again. 
MARY hesitates, then salutes back.

MARY
Very good, Bub. That's....very good.

99	INT. A LOCKER ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

PEOPLE are changing clothes, going on and off duty. JULIE GRANT 
rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her LAB COAT. 
MARY HENRIED enters the room, spots JULIE, and rushes towards her.

MARY
Where the hell have you been?

JULIE doesn't respond. She buttons her coat never looking up.

MARY
Julie. Are you alright?
(still no response)
You were missed this morning. I need you. I 
don't want you getting your ass in hot 
water. I won't be able to help you if...

JULIE
I don't need any help from you!

JULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit.

MARY
Julie...JULIE!

But she's gone. The locker door has bounced open. MARY slams it and 
it bounces again. She pounds it with her fist. Suddenly, A LOUD BELL 
SOUNDS. MARY looks at her watch then exits.

There are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS. One 
of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit. We recognise her. It's 
SPIDER.

100	INT. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE CAVE - MORNING

This is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT 
HEADQUARTERS. In A BIG, STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED 
WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida, now of 
the world) A.K.A.... GASPARILLA.

At TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN, Dickerson's cronies from the 
old Doral Country Club, close friends who were offered asylum in the 
private underground shelter. Now they sit in council, "yessing" 
everything the boss man says.

A STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor, 
standing with his hands cuffed.

PROSECUTOR
He was found with a government-issue short-
wave transmitter in his quarters. He's 
charged with the theft of that equipment 
from a government installation and with 
possession of an illegal radio.

GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT. He's a fat man with a handlebar 
moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of 
rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt 
with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled 
in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business.

PROSECUTOR
I can only suggest that the court rule in 
favour of the ultimate penalty for this 
traitor.

GASPARILLA
You always recommend the ultimate penalty, 
Tommy Lee. You and Rhodes.

We now see that RHODES is present, looking on with a smile.

GASPARILLA
All those...AGAINST...the ultimate penalty 
raise yer hands.

None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle. GASPARILLA scans them slowly as 
he takes a big, wet bite out of a peach.

GASPARILLA
Ya mean ta say nobody's gonna object to the 
ultimate penalty in this here case? Well, 
what if I object? What if I object to the 
ultimate penalty.

THE COUNCILMEN look nervous, apprehensive. GASPARILLA'S flexing his 
power-muscles.

GASPARILLA
There's been a whole lotta swingin' 
influence and swingin' weight arountyere 
lately. Does anybody at all give two shits 
fer what I think any more? Well, I'm a-
gonna let this guy off. How d'yall like 
that? And I want the word ta git out I let 
'im off. I let 'im off. Not this council. 
Maybe I can improve my image rountyere.

THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA, hatred boiling inside him. 
GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer.

GASPARILLA
Yer sentenced ta hard labour. Stalag 
Seventeen. A year.

PRISONER
WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME! I PREFER TO DIE! I 
DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH... WITH THIS KIND 
OF...SIN!

GASPARILLA
WELL, PISS ON YOU, MISTER! I JUST SAVED 
YOUR ASS! YOU DAMN WELL BETTER NOT GO 
HOLLERIN' LIKE THAT IN HERE!

PRISONER
I SPIT ON YOU! THE ULTIMATE PENALTY FOR 
YOU! BURN IN HELL...FOR THE ULTIMATE SIN! 
PIG! ALL OF YOU! PIGS!

GUARDS drag the screaming PRISONER from the room. GASPARILLA flops 
back in his chair, flustered but unscarred. His skin is about a foot 
thick. He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango. MARY HENRIED enters 
the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair. GASPARILLA checks THE 
DOCKET on his desk, smiles, and looks up at MARY.

GASPARILLA
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. 
You're just in time fer a case that seems 
ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about 
the other proceedin's we been dealin' with 
here this mornin'.

MARY
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.

GASPARILLA
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in 
time fer this case, didn't ya?

RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor. He smiles at MARY 
pointedly as he starts his speech.

RHODES
Sir. In the matter of the State versus 
Private Tyler, I don't want to...

MARY
(standing) Sir, Tyler is innocent of any 
crime against the State. Captain Rhodes 
is...

GASPARILLA
(with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried, I 
think you better...

MARY
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...

GASPARILLA
(spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his 
hand) MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!

MARY'S eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up. 
GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his 
fingers on his military jacket.

RHODES
I don't want to take up a lot of time with 
this. Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against 
orders. There are eyewitnesses. I've 
reprimanded Tyler and I've had him sent 
outside. It's as simple as that.

GASPARILLA
Ya had 'im sent ta the Stalag? That's all 
ya did to 'im?

RHODES
The prisoner was dying, sir. Tyler acted 
out of a sense of mercy. I don't believe 
Tyler to be dangerous, General. He just 
needs...discipline. Two or three months 
outside will teach him...discipline.

MARY
Sir. It's quite clear that...

GASPARILLA
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!

MARY
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...

GASPARILLA
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD 
O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER 
NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA 
SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM 
YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T 
SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!

MARY checks herself. There's a perverse air of danger fuming off the 
fat General. His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed. RHODES has 
been working on him. MARY seems to have lost this round. She can only 
hope that's all she's going to lose.

GASPARILLA
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, 
considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got 
shit ta complain about.

MARY
(softly, carefully) I'm sorry, General, if 
I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr 
Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has 
no representation. I don't believe due 
process is being served by...

GASPARILLA
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process 
that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one 
of the people doin' the servin' from now on 
is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' 
aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer 
long enough! All that's

GASPARILLA
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still 
got a statement you'd like ta make, you can 
jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.

MARY
Tonight?

GASPARILLA
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. 
We'll start out in my gymnasium an' 
progress on from there...to various other 
forms o' physical therapy.

MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES. THE CAPTAIN responds 
with a phoney look of sympathy.

101	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT, TREADMILLS, WEIGHTS, A 
NAUTILUS, ETC. There are other items which seem contradictory, PLUSH 
PILLOWS, A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS. Delicacies of 
FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES. The room is a cross between 
Elaine Powers and a harem chamber.

A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined 
with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass. GASPARILLA 
lounges inside the thing, sweating, having just taken a long dose of 
fake sunshine.

All around are THE COUNCILMEN, some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN, 
conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously 
wives left over from the good old days), and some with SCANTILY CLAD 
COURTESANS.

OTHER SCANTILY CLAD "BUNNY" TYPES are serving HORS-D'OEUVRES and 
pouring WINE, offering SMOKE AND SNORT.

MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor, lost in fluffy pillows, her LAB 
COAT incongruous. RHODES watches her from nearby.

GASPARILLA
AWRITE. C'MON LADIES. OFF WITH IT... AND ON 
WITH IT...HA HA HA...

MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up, stripping off 
what few clothes they are wearing. Some strip naked, others down to 
panties. They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to 
"workout", tits flopping, thighs pumping...GASPARILLA'S kind of 
entertainment.

GASPARILLA
Oh, Lordy, Lordy...I'm drunk as a skunk. 
Look at this...will ya jus' loooooook at 
these lovelies! Say, Henried, you ever try 
it with another woman?

MARY looks up at the General, not knowing whether or not she should 
answer, afraid of what he might try to make her do.

GASPARILLA
I've tried it with boys. Too strenuous.

FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS-
D'OEUVRES, prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi. They're 
distributed and people eat them

GASPARILLA
Folks...I just couldn't resist. How d'yall 
like those? How do those taste?

GUESTS look up, not knowing what to expect. MARY fears the worst. She 
looks around to see RHODES grinning. A knot comes up into her throat. 
She tries to swallow it down.

GASPARILLA
Fresh from the freezers, folks. It's 
what...THEY...EAT!

A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed. ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs 
from the room.

GASPARILLA
Just kiddin' folks. Just kiddin'. Would I 
do a thing like that? I ask ya now, would 
I? Hah ha ha ha ha...

Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself. 
GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on 
some pillows near MARY. He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine 
which runs down his front.

GASPARILLA
The great state of Florida. People came 
here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. 
The rest o' the country used ta think we 
was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and 
fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new 
Capital o' the World! Hah! They came 
here...died...went to hell...and the Devil 
sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General 
Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!

MARY
We think there are other cities surviving. 
We think maybe Detroit... there's some 
signalling out of Philly.

GASPARILLA
There's no place like this place. Warm 
climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't 
nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the 
Feds knew that. That's why they stored so 
much o' their shit down here. It's all mine 
now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come 
after us down here, which they will some 
day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' 
come after us. They'll hafta get past my 
army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha 
ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA 
HA....

MARY
It's not a very big army. And small as it 
is you won't be able to continue feeding it 
for very long. We've got to find ways of 
getting them to respond without relying 
on...

GASPARILLA
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when 
ya do...we'll sail on over to the 
mainland...or any other damn mainland fer 
that matter...and start us a recruitin' 
program. There's millions o' Bees out there 
jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on 
ta vict'ry!

GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine.

DISSOLVE TO:

102	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The room is empty now. Remnants of food and drink clutter the place. 
THE FAT GENERAL is asleep, snoring loudly, one of his pudgy arms is 
draped across MARY HENRIED'S lap. She is trying to move out from 
under without waking the man. She slides on the floor...a few 
inches...a few inches more. GASPARILLA snorts and rolls over. His 
eyes pop open, focus on MARY, and a smile pushes his fat cheeks back.

GASPARILLA
Well, hi there, y'all.

Mary looks down at the man, repulsed and afraid. Suddenly he grabs 
her LAB COAT. She pulls away and he crawls after her, his belly 
bouncing along the floor. BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open. He 
reaches for her blouse. It tears away and for a moment he gets a 
chubby handful of bare breast. He dives into her but he's unconscious 
before his face reaches her chest.

MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight. Shivering, she 
clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room.

103	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - DAWN

Light is just breaking through the trees when THE GATES ARE OPENED 
admitting FIVE UNIFORMED MEN into the compound. Outside the fence 
ZOMBIES clamber excitedly as always.

104	INT. THE RITZ - DAWN

SARAH jumps, awakened by A VOICE AND THE LOUD POUNDING OF RIFLES 
against the upright of the sleeping hut.

RHODES
REVEILLE! REVEILLE! RISE AND SHINE!

RHODES is standing near the entrance. FOUR SOLDIERS are doing the 
pounding. Stunned, disease-ridden faces look up as CITIZENS are 
awakened from sleep. Fear sweeps through the place like a tropical 
wind.

RHODES
We found two white Bees in the jungle with 
their heads chopped open. I want to know 
who's going outside the compound. I want to 
know how they're going out. I want to know 
why they're going out. Until I get these 
answers...each morning...some of you will 
die.

Without warning RHODES draws his MAGNUM and...BLAM! BLAM! He shoots 
TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range. They tumble to the 
dirt floor, dead before they hit.

RHODES scans the rest of the hut. He spots a familiar face, THE 
PRISONER from the Council Room, the one Gasparilla saved from a death 
sentence. The man makes the sign of the cross, knowing what's coming. 
BLAM! BLAM! RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONER'S CHEST 
TURNS RED. He flies off his cot into one adjacent, landing on top of 
a SCREAMING WOMAN.

RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered. SARAH is 
stunned. As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams, she 
locks her eyes on RHODES.

He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open-
walled structure. He passes within inches of SARAH'S cot which is 
right against the outside rail. Her emotions well up inside her. She 
is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her 
arm. It's JOHN, who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside.

SARAH
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is 
all happening because of me. If I turn 
myself in...

JOHN
He's just finding another reason for 
bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us 
ta die. He needs our bodies. 

Behind JOHN on the street TOBY TYLER is looking on. He has heard the 
conversation. JOHN turns and sees him. His eyes go dark with 
apprehension.

TOBY
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and 
so do you. What's a safe place to talk?

JOHN
Ain't no place safe.

TOBY
Look...I know you have no reason to trust 
me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got 
some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm 
gonna try to get off the island.

PEOPLE are pushing in closer attracted by the commotion inside the 
Ritz. TOBY has to make it fast. He whispers.

TOBY
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the 
hospital...

JOHN
The hospital? (surprised, worried)

TOBY
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red 
crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me 
at the hospital after the supplies come in. 
Maybe we can find a place there to talk.

JOHN
Maybe.

TOBY drifts off into the crowd. JOHN AND SARAH exchange glances.

105	EXT. ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING

SUPPLIES are being brought in through THE MAIN GATES, CRATES, 
CARTONS, BAGS OF GRAIN, SEED, FERTILISER.

TRICKS is in charge of the patrol from the Cave. He's checking items 
as they're picked up by WORKERS from the compound. TOBY TYLER sidles 
up to his friend.

TOBY
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.

TRICKS
Not as bad as yours, pal.

TOBY
(whispering) What'dya get?

TRICKS
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.

TOBY
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.

LUKEY, the orderly, picks up A DOLLY which is LOADED DOWN WITH CRATES 
MARKED WITH RED CROSSES.

TRICKS
Hey, you. Those two on the bottom. Don't 
open those yet. They might be from the 
wrong shipment. Just keep 'em around 'til I 
can check.

LUKEY
Yessir. I never open 'em. Nossir. I keep 
'em innaback for you.

106	EXT. FRONT STREET OF STALAG SEVENTEEN - MORNING

Watching from the shadows of A BUILDING are JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL.

DIESEL
He's a spy. A spy for Rhodes.

JOHN
Give him a chance.

They see TOBY pull away from TRICKS and start down the street 
following LUKEY. They move out and catch up with TOBY, flanking him.

JOHN
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You 
tell him we was rebels?

TOBY
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two 
crates. Can you get me into the hospital?

SHORT CUT TO:

107	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - MORNING

CREAK! A CROWBAR pries open A CRATE. JOHN AND LUKEY guard the 
entrance while TOBY AND DIESEL work at opening the "Red Cross" boxes. 
SARAH stands nearby. THE LIDS LIFT and we see TWO ARMY-ISSUE LIFE 
RAFTS.

TOBY
There ya go. Complete with air 
canisters...little motors.

JOHN
We got a boat.

TOBY
What?

JOHN
I say we got a boat. Can you get other 
stuff?

TOBY
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, 
some automatic rifles.

DIESEL
He's just tryin' to win us over. This 
doesn't prove anything.

JOHN
I'm gonna trust him, Diesel. He already 
knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch 
o' time to mess around with Rhodes shootin' 
up the joint every mornin'.

TOBY, rooting through the open crates, finds THE PISTOLS TRICKS told 
him about and A FEW BOXES OF AMMO. He tosses one of the guns to JOHN. 
The big man walks over and puts the weapon back inside the crate.

JOHN
Can't walk around here with these. Let's 
just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use 
'em.

108	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON: HANDS carefully...very carefully...pouring DROPS OF CLEAR 
LIQUID INTO A TEST TUBE. The liquid is sweating slowly out of A 
MILDEWED AND ROTTING STICK OF DYNAMITE which has been softened to 
near-melting by jungle heat.

A DOZEN TEST TUBES stand in a rack, already filled. SPIDER, another 
woman, SALLY, and a man, JACK, each have their own DYNAMITE STICK. 
Each is transferring LIQUID SWEAT...which is, of course, nitro 
glycerine...into A GLASS TUBE. They work in tense silence on the 
operating table.

DOC LOGAN works with them, doing the same delicate procedure. 
Suddenly his hands starts to tremble.

LOGAN
Take it away from me. Quickly. Take it! 
Take it!

SPIDER reaches over and, as gently as possible, takes the VIAL and 
THE DYNAMITE out of the doctor's hands. She sets the tube in the rack 
and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE, years old and crusted with 
mildew and mud, still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained. The 
danger passed, they all breathe a sigh of relief. LOGAN wipes the 
river of sweat from his face. His hands are shaking quite violently 
now. He pops pills, dry, from his pocket.

LOGAN
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll, er...I'll be 
alright...in a moment.

JOHN
You're sick, Doc. You been sick for a while 
now. Too sick to be workin' with us on this 
raid.

JOHN, SARAH AND DIESEL are standing in a corner of the room. TOBY 
TYLER is with them, sweating and obviously nervous.

JOHN
You've helped us enough, providin' cover, 
hidin' us out. Let the rest of us handle 
the physical stuff. It's too much for you.

LOGAN
It's my fight as much as yours. The things 
they made me do...the things they 
made...me...do. I want so see Rhodes 
destroyed. I want to see all of them, all 
of them destroyed. It's my duty...in the 
eyes of God. In the eyes of God.

LOGAN is really flipso now, over the edge into banana-land.

TOBY
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're 
dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if 
you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, 
walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on 
feather pillows? You don't have a complete 
layout of the place. Even if you manage to 
avoid a fight you won't know where to go.

JOHN
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, 
Toby.

TOBY
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island 
alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not 
goin' in there on a suicide mission. What 
can you hope to accomplish? Some radios 
maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be 
killed and in a few weeks they'll be back 
to business as usual. That place was built 
to withstand nuclear attack! What are you 
gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few 
sticks of nitro?

JOHN
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.

TOBY
What?

JOHN
We know what's down there. We did the 
loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came 
ashore in the early days. A direct hit 
oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' 
damage.

TOBY
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole 
island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? 
How're you gonna leave yourself time to get 
out?

LOGAN
If we don't get out it's a small price to 
pay.

TOBY
You're fuckin' out of your minds! There's 
two hundred people down there. You gonna 
murder two hundred people?

LOGAN
Sinners! Animals! Filth! Doing the work of 
the Devil!

TOBY
What about the people here in the camp? If 
they don't get blown to kingdom come their 
food'll be destroyed, their water, medical 
supplies. They won't have any more power. 
This island can't support them all, they'll 
be doomed. Count me out, friends. I'm gonna 
get my ass outa here. Anybody wants to come 
along is welcome.

Silence falls over the room. Finally JOHN moves towards the door. 
TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once 
more.

TOBY
I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you 
do...but all those people. We don't have 
the right to be their judges... just like 
they don't have the right to be our judges.

JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits. SARAH follows. JOHN looks around 
at the faces in the group, then he leaves, shutting the door behind 
him. There's a long silence, then LOGAN speaks.

LOGAN
We know what we must do. It's written for 
us in the Bible. "They shall be driven from 
the land of the living down to the world of 
the dead. That is the fate of those who 
care nothing for God."

109	INT. STORAGE BAY IN THE HOSPITAL - DAY

LUKEY stands guard. McDERMOTT has joined SARAH AND JOHN in a strategy 
huddle. TOBY stands nearby, feeling strangely guilty.

SARAH
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around 
with their fingers up their asses while we 
bust up their toys.

JOHN
Datura.

SARAH
What?

JOHN
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't 
worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's 
a flower that grows on these islands. Where 
I come from the voodoo priests used it 
whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's 
toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink 
or inject it...or...in a sealed area it 
might be introduced through the ventilation 
system.

SARAH
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was 
shouting! Datura Metel!

JOHN
We always planned to use it. We got some 
ground up already...but we could never find 
enough.

SARAH
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we 
landed our boat.

TOBY
This stuff really works? No shit?

JOHN
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot 
prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts 
ya under fer a good night's sleep.

TOBY
If you could knock out the central 
communications room you could foul up their 
whole intercom system. Then, if you move 
fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without 
bein' able to signal each other, they might 
have a hard time catchin' you.

JOHN
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. 
The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' 
doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha 
ha...

110	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT

THE FISHING BOAT that bought SARAH and her friends to the island sits 
still in the channel. There are SOLDIERS ABOARD, two of Rhodes' men, 
pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth.

JOHN (o.s.)
Well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did 
they.

JOHN, SARAH AND TOBY are huddled behind green cover peering out at 
the boat.

SARAH
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when 
the time comes.

JOHN
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave 
entrance number five.

TOBY
That entrance is closest to the labs and 
the Bee cages.

JOHN
Come on. Let's go.

They move off stealthily.

They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel 
discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with 
their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to 
southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean.

SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping 
off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. 
They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves 
in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them.

JOHN
Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a 
while. Can't breathe this grass too long or 
somebody hafta carry you home.

Work goes on in silence.

111	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT

MUSIC ROCKS AND VOICES SHOUT. The street scene is as wild as ever. 
HOOKERS, PUSHERS AND DRUNKS pack the hot darkness.

112	INT. THE RITZ - NIGHT

At A COT near the open wall, in DIM LIGHT FROM AN OVERHEAD BULB 
OUTSIDE, SARAH, JOHN AND TOBY huddle. The DIN from the street makes 
it impossible for others to hear them. TOBY is drawing A MAP.

TOBY
Maintenance shafts run behind all the main 
rooms. Nobody's in those at night. You can 
use them to get around in. Hit the power 
governors first. Kick a surge into their 
computer network and you erase everything 
stored in the memory. Then...over in 
here...that's where the cages are...

On the street outside, a puffing BILL McDERMOTT pushes through the 
unruly crowd, his face showing alarm.

McDERMOTT
The Doc's gone. Diesel and Jack and Spider 
with him. They took the guns... and the 
nitro.

CUT TO:

113	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: LUKEY, beside himself, almost to the point of tears.

LUKEY
I coulden stop 'em, boss. No way I coulda 
stop 'em, I sweah. They tie me up and stick 
dis...
(He's waving a pillowcase in his hand, the 
action accentuating his frenzied state.)
...they stick dis in my mouf. You b'lieve 
dis?

JOHN is in the room with SARAH, TOBY, SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT. This 
is now the entire rebel force. THE FLOORBOARDS TO THE TUNNEL have 
been thrown aside. The weapons are gone.

McDERMOTT
I was in the Cave yesterday workin' 
repairs. Spider was in on clean up. I seen 
her talkin' ta some insiders... well, she 
was scribblin', they was talkin'...mighty 
palsy.

 TOBY
Jesus! They're gonna try to do it! They're 
goin' in! They got somebody to help 'em 
from the inside!

LUKEY
They din' get da pistols. You know dem 
pistols you buddy send in widda raffs.

TOBY
I gotta get Mary out. Tricks. We gotta go 
now! Tonight! Right away!

McDERMOTT
Oh, Lord! (He polishes of what's left in 
his flask and moves to refill it from the 
bottles in Logan's cabinet.)

SALLY
We're not ready.	

JOHN
Well...if ya think about it...we as ready 
as we ever gonna be. How was they carryin' 
the nitro, Lukey?

LUKEY
Oh, me. You ain't gonna b'lieve dis, 
neider. You ain't, I sweah. They put it 
inta Spidah's body.

TOBY
They what?

LUKEY
De Doc. He cut up Spidah here and here and 
here...all ovah. He stick dem tubes in 
dere, like undah da skin...an' den he sews 
'em all up. I sweah. I sweah, sweah, sweah!

114	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

JACK AND DIESEL are chopping a path through the undergrowth with 
MACHETES. Behind them DOC LOGAN is walking slowly along with SPIDER, 
guiding her carefully around obstacles. SPIDER is in major pain. 
She's sweating rivers, her fists are clenched, she's biting her lover 
lip so that it bleeds.

LOGAN
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then 
all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you 
could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO 
HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO 
HURT SO!

DIESEL
Quiet!

LOGAN
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.

Suddenly, A ZOMBIE lunges from the underbrush, its FACE BADLY 
DETERIORATED and one of its hands; lost during its human life, 
replaced by A MECHANICAL HOOK. SPIDER stumbles. She holds her breath 
and stiffens all her muscles. Miraculously the nitro vials inside her 
do not explode. LOGAN throws himself quixotically in front of THE 
ZOMBIE.

LOGAN
FALLEN ANGEL! THIS IS THE JUDGEMENT DAY 
WHEN YOU WILL BURN FOR YOUR SINS! THE LORD 
WILL CAST YOU DOWN TO THE LOWER REACHES AND 
YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW....

THWOK!!! THE ZOMBIE'S STEEL HOOK SINKS DEEPLY INTO LOGAN'S UPPER 
CHEST. The man's eyes reflect no immediate sensation. His speech 
falters but only slightly.

LOGAN
...YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN... THE 
PAIN...

THE ZOMBIE pulls LOGAN towards its DROOLING, WIDE OPEN MOUTH. It's 
just about to bite when DIESEL CHOPS HIS MACHETE INTO THE CENTER OF 
THE CREATURE'S SKULL. The thing falls, pulling LOGAN, still hooked, 
to the ground with it.

LOGAN
YOU SHALL FOREVER KNOW THE PAIN OF HELL... 
THE PAIN OF HELL.

DIESEL frees the doctor's shoulder from the hook. BLOOD FLOWS FREELY. 
DIESEL grabs a handful of DRESSINGS from LOGAN'S PACK and goes to 
work on the wound.

LOGAN
...the pain of Hell...the pain...the 
pain...

115	EXT. THE JUNGLE NEAR THE VENTS - NIGHT

SARAH, SALLY, LUKEY AND McDERMOTT stand by while JOHN AND TOBY swing 
open THE RUSTED GRILLWORK OF AN AIR-VENT in the ground. TOBY is able 
to swing his upper torso completely down inside.

116	INT. THE VENT - NIGHT

TOBY hangs up-side-down in A RUSH OF AIR. He tightens A HOSPITAL MASK 
over his nose and mouth.

TOBY
Okay. Lemme have 'em.

A LEAF BAG is passed in from above. TOBY flags the bag open and BITS 
OF FLOWER AND POLLEN DUST FLY through the tight space, sucked off 
into the duct.

117	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A GRILL NEAR THE CEILING. BITS OF TOXIC POLLEN and AN 
OCCASIONAL PIECE OF FLOWER blow into the room.

There are SIX TECHNICIANS AND TWO SECURITY GUARDS posted at various 
stations. A RADIO MAN looks up.

RADIO MAN
What's that? Smell it?

TECHNICIAN
Dunno. Must be comin' from outside. Kinda 
nice.

118	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER SEVEN - NIGHT

There are only TWO GUARDS posted at the sealed entrance. One is 
eating from A CAN OF SPAM. The other is reading an old, dog-eared 
PLAYBOY. A RIFLE BARREL jabs suddenly into "Playboy's" back.

JULIE
Don't move!

It's JULIE GRANT, Mary's disgruntled assistant. A YOUNG MAN, another 
behaviouralist in a WHITE LAB COAT is with her. They both have 
RIFLES.

JULIE
Open the outer door. Move it!

"Playboy" slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL. At the 
last minute, he spins around, grabbing JULIE'S GUN BARREL and pushing 
it away. JULIE'S YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks 
"Playboy" cold. Then he trains the weapon on "Spam man" again.

JULIE moves to the controls, examines them, trips A TOGGLE marked 
"LOCK" and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON.

THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN. Beyond is blackness with an 
occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH. JULIE walks slowly, 
carefully toward the opening. Just as she is about to cross the 
threshold into the night, A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her, grabbing her 
RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold. It's DIESEL. Behind him, 
comes JACK, his RIFLE (Sarah's rifle) levelled off at JULIE'S YOUNG 
FRIEND.

"Spam man" makes a break for it down the hall. Reacting nervously, 
too quickly, JACK FIRES. "SPAM MAN" IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK. He 
pitches forward, dead.

THE YOUNG SCIENTIST raises his gun.

YOUNG MAN
Hey! What the hell.....?

JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S 
CHEST SHOW A DOTTED LINE OF RED. He flies back, a surprised 
expression on his face, and he flops, dead, right on top of the 
"Playboy" guard who is lying near the control booth.

LOGAN
ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH!

THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the 
threshold and into the hall. LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John 
Houston, floating on air in a madman's bubble.

JULIE
What...what is this? Who...?

LOGAN
It's alright, it's alright, my dear. You've 
simply helped us do the Lord's work.

LOGAN'S SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the 
doctor, on a holy mission, seems to feel no pain. He guides SPIDER 
into the light and opens her shirt. DIESEL shoves JULIE against a 
wall. JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC.

LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDER'S skin. All over her 
bare chest and upper belly we see LONG, EIGHT-INCH SCARS, HASTILY 
STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING. Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE 
where a vial of nitro has been implanted. The woman stands on 
crumbling legs, her arms open outward, a grotesque lampoon of a 
stigmatic.

JULIE
What...what have you done to her?

LOGAN
God forgive us. Forgive us the pain we 
inflict as surgeons. We'll be in Heaven, 
child. Soon. We'll be with Him in Heaven.

SPIDER
Na...na...ak...aaaaaaaaaa...

SPIDER is trying to signal something. She has seen that "PLAYBOY" is 
crawling into the control booth. LOGAN follows her alarmed gaze.

LOGAN
NO YOU DON'T I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT! I 
CAN'T!

LOGAN charges toward the booth. THE GUARD is half-in-half-out of the 
glass chamber, his hands reaching for the control panel inside. LOGAN 
starts to kick him, again and again.

JACK
Outa the way, Doc! Outa the way!

There's vengeance on LOGAN'S face. He's kicking THE GUARD brutally, 
but that doesn't stop the man from reaching the controls. He hits A 
RED ALARM BUTTON. THE PANEL BUZZES AND COLOURED LIGHTS BLINK. THE 
DOOR to the jungle starts to swing closed. DIESEL dives at it but 
can't stop the steel slab. It slams with A LOUD THUNNNNNG!

JACK swings into another position to get a clear shot and he FIRES A 
LONG BURST into the control booth. "PLAYBOY" IS STRUCK BY SEVERAL 
ROUNDS. He bounces around in the booth and collapses to the floor, 
dead.

LOGAN, his SHOULDER WOUND POURING BLOOD, aggravated by his physical 
exertion, falls to floor himself, in a faint.

JACK
Shit!

DIESEL
Keep the woman covered.

JACK levels off on JULIE again. DIESEL moves over to SPIDER. Pulling 
FRESH DRESSING from LOGAN'S BAG, the big man begins to pack them onto 
SPIDER'S BLEEDING CHEST.

119	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A BLINKING RECTANGLE OF RED LIGHT. Written on its face is: 
ALARM - GATE 7. A BELL RINGS LOUDLY in the room. THE SHOT WIDENS and 
we see FIVE MEN, all slumped, unconscious, none able to react to the 
alarm.

ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS has made it to THE EXIT. He manages to 
push the door open, but then he falls in a heap.

A RADIO MAN staggers into A WEBBING OF WIRES, then he too falls.

THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD inches his hand towards A LEVER WITH A 
PROTECTIVE COVER. He flips the cover up, then collapses. The falling 
action causes his fingers to trip the lever. A HUGE KLAXON SOUNDS. A 
BLINKING RECTANGLE, huge over the doors, reads: GENERAL ALERT!

120	INT. GASPARILLA'S GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The usual scene here, GASPARILLA AND HIS COURTESANS entertaining THE 
COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADIES. THE KLAXON SOUNDS over THE LOUD ROCK 
MUSIC. MARY HENRIED, a prisoner for the evening again, hears THE 
SOUND. Her eyes widen. She looks over at RHODES, who jumps to his 
feet. The party gradually goes silent.

RHODES
Don't be alarmed. We're impregnable. Stay 
where you are. Nothing will happen to any 
of you. You're safe here. Men.

This last word to A SMALL UNIT OF FOUR TROOPERS standing guard at THE 
EXIT. RHODES goes steaming through the doors. TWO OF THE TROOPERS 
FOLLOW, THE OTHER TWO unsling their RIFLES and take up posts just 
outside in the corridor. THE STEEL DOOR SLIDES SHUT locking 
GASPARILLA AND HIS COURT inside the gymnasium...MARY HENRIED with 
them.

GASPARILLA
Well, c'mon, ladies and gents. Who says we 
gotta let our evenin' get spoiled? Simon 
sez...GET DOWN!!!

MOST OF THE GUESTS are willing to let the party get back to full 
swing. GASPARILLA grabs A TOPLESS COURTESAN and rocks his fat belly 
around in an attempted dance. MARY seems to be the only one concerned 
about the alarm.

121	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

Even outside THE KLAXON CAN BE HEARD. TOBY AND THE REBELS stop in 
their tracks.

TOBY
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta 
got in!

JOHN
What you wanna do?

TOBY
Come on!

THE GROUP moves out urgently.

122	INT. ENTRANCE NUMBER TWO - NIGHT

A CIRCULAR LIGHT BLINKS GREEN with A BUZZING SOUND. THE TWO INSIDE 
GUARDS punch up A VIDEO MONITOR. The screen shows TOBY TYLER AND 
LUKEY holding PISTOLS on SALLY AND BILL McDERMOTT.

GUARD
(into intercom) What's goin' on?

TOBY (filter)
(on video) LET US IN. THERE'S BEEN A 
REVOLT...AT STALAG SEVENTEEN...THERE'S 
REBELS CRAWLIN' EVERYWHERE!

GUARD #2
I know him. That's Tyler.

TOBY (filter)
(on video) FER CHRISSAKE! LEMME IN, DAMMIT! 
LEMME IN!

THE FIRST GUARD HITS A BUTTON AND THE BIG STEEL ENTRANCE DOOR SWINGS 
OPEN. THE REBELS storm in like an ocean wave taking the hapless 
GUARDS completely by surprise. They knock them unconscious and take 
their WEAPONS. TOBY pushes A BUTTON which causes the outer door to 
swing shut, then he leads the band down the corridor.

They go through A DOOR about a hundred yards from the entrance.

123	INT. MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT

This is one of the WORK CORRIDORS that TOBY mentioned earlier. THE 
REBELS run, single-file, deep into the Cave.

124	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

JULIE GRANT has been ROPE-TIED to an eyelet in the wall. DIESEL sets 
down A PISTOL AND A BOX OF AMMO beside DOC LOGAN who is sitting on 
the floor beside the control booth. He's having trouble catching his 
breath. His WOUND has turned his ENTIRE FRONT RED.

DIESEL
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.

LOGAN
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.

SPIDER, her shirt buttoned again over her new dressings, is carefully 
signing something. DIESEL reads her fingers.

DIESEL
Maps. Yes. She was supposed to bring us 
maps.

JACK steps over to JULIE. He frisks her pockets and finds TWO HAND-
DRAWN MAPS showing complete layouts of the Cave.

DIESEL
Alright. Let's go.

They move out, DIESEL supporting SPIDER, JACK with his RIFLE ready.

125	INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET - NIGHT

TOBY breaks open A CARTON and pulls GAS MASKS out. He passes them 
back to BILL McDERMOTT AND SARAH.

126	INT. THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

THE REBELS, all wearing GAS MASKS, burst into the room. TOBY moves 
right toward AN INTERCOM. He punches in a code and waits while the 
INTERCOM BUZZES.

TOBY
Come on, Mary. Answer. ANSWER!

Nothing. Toby punches up another code while the others drag THE 
UNCONSCIOUS GUARD out of the doorway, letting the doors shut behind 
them. A VOICE comes over the speakers.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
Yeah.

TOBY
Tricks, it's Tyler. We're inside.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
What? Was that you that set off the alarms?

TOBY
No. There's some loonies from outside. 
They're gonna try to blow the powder 
magazine.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
Where are you? What's the plan?

TOBY
Find Mary. If you can get help do it. We're 
gonna hit the power station and haul-ass 
outa here. We'll be at exit five...that's 
exit five in exactly ten minutes.

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
I think I can get a couple guys.

TOBY
And Mary! You gotta find Mary!

TRICKS (o.s. - filter)
I'll try, Tob. I'm gone.

TRICKS clicks off. TOBY levels his AUTOMATIC at the RADIO CONSOLE and 
FIRES. SPARKS FLY, CHUNKS OF WOOD AND METAL SHOOT OFF IN EVERY 
DIRECTION.

McDERMOTT
HOLD ON! HOLD ON! Yer wastin' yer 
ammunition. Hit 'er in here...then around 
back in the circuit boards.

TOBY levels off again, this time at the "kill-zones". BULLETS FLY. 
MORE SPARKS DANCE as THE UNIT BREAKS APART.

McDERMOTT
(shouting) AND OVER HERE. THE ALARM 
SYSTEMS. THESE CENTRAL PANELS HERE. THESE 
CIRCUITS.

SARAH AND SALLY step up and start BLASTING. A PROFUSION OF SPARKS 
this time as THE ALARM SYSTEMS SEEM TO EXPLODE.

Suddenly A COLLECTION OF RED LIGHTS START BLINKING URGENTLY. A BELL 
SOUNDS. THE LARGE RECTANGLE OVER THE EXIT IS FLASHING A NEW WORD: 
EVACUATE! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!

McDERMOTT
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! (he slugs from his 
flask) By blowin' the alarm panels...we 
signalled an Evac!

127	INT. CORRIDORS IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: A LOUD BUZZING IS HEARD as DOORS OPEN everywhere, some 
sliding, some swinging back, some rolling into the walls. TROOPERS 
caught trotting through halls are taken by surprise. CITIZENS spill 
out of apartment doors that have opened electronically.

128	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

THE DOOR TO THE JUNGLE SWING OPEN. JULIE GRANT looks over at DOC 
LOGAN. The madman struggles to his feet. Supporting himself against 
the wall of the control booth, he reaches inside and starts pushing 
buttons.

JULIE
Those buttons won't work! The evacuation 
command overrides them.

JULIE looks through the open entranceway. Barely visible in the DIM 
BLUE MOONLIGHT are the hulking shapes of TWO...NO THREE ZOMBIES, 
approaching the open hatch.

129	INT. THE COMMUNICATION ROOM - NIGHT

McDERMOTT is explaining to the others.

McDERMOTT
All the doors in the Cave have been sprung 
open...all the ones that work on electric. 
It's so nobody'll get trapped anywhere.

130	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

LOGAN stares dumbly, without comprehending, at THE ZOMBIES which are 
lurching forward out of the night.

JULIE
CUT ME LOOSE! PLEASE! CUT ME LOOSE!

131	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

THE LATCHES ON THE CELL DOOR CLICK. With BUZZING, MOTOR NOISES, THE 
DOORS OPEN OUTWARD. THE ARMY OF RED COATS marches out into the hall. 
We might recognise TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON....we certainly recognise big 
Bub.

132	INT. A HOLDING PEN IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

We see A LARGE PEN, its GATE SWINGING OPEN. From inside, MOANING 
HUNGRILY, come FORTY OR FIFTY ZOMBIES, BLUE COATS AND WHITE.

GUARDS outside the pen start to panic. They OPEN FIRE. A FEW ZOMBIES 
ARE HIT but there are too many, way too many. THE GUARDS turn tail 
and retreat off into the Cave.

THE ZOMBIES are out! Free to find their own suppers!

133	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

THE DOORS have opened here, too. THE CROWD, having heard the 
EVACUATION SIGNAL, is panicking. MANY are running out past THE GUARDS 
and into the hallway. GASPARILLA is trying to reinstate calm.

GASPARILLA
STAY HERE! STAY PUT! WE'LL BE ALRIGHT! 
WE'RE SAFE HERE! JUST AS SAFE AS ANYWHERE 
'TIL WE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOIN' ON!

MARY HENRIED takes advantage of the confusion. She slips out behind 
TWO COUNCILMEN AND THEIR LADY-FRIENDS.

134	INT. NURSERY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

THE HALLWAY is in chaos. TROOPERS run by, CRAZED CITIZENS flee in 
both directions. MARY HENRIED is stopped by A NURSE standing in AN 
OPEN DOORWAY.

NURSE
What is it? What's happening?

MARY
It's an evacuation signal. The radios are 
out. People are panicking.

NURSE
What should we do?

MARY looks past THE NURSE into A ROOM where A GROUP OF CHILDREN, a 
dozen or so, ranging from twelve-years-old down to infancy, are 
huddled. Some are crying.

MARY
God. I, er...I dunno what to say. It could 
be a real evacuation or it could just be a 
glitch in the system. Wait here for now. 
I'll...I'll make sure you get the word what 
to do, okay?

NURSE
Please...hurry...

MARY takes off down the hall.

135	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: JULIE GRANT'S FACE, screaming, in agony, on the brink of 
insanity. THE ZOMBIES have reached her. They're started to pull at 
her arms, her legs. ONE BITES HER HAND, ANOTHER HER ARM, ANOTHER HER 
CALF.

DOC LOGAN is watching from the control booth, all the while fiddling 
with BUTTONS, DIALS, LEVERS.

LOGAN
We'll be in Heaven soon. We'll all be in 
Heaven soon.
(Julie's screams penetrate the fog in his 
brain. He frowns.)
Pain. God forgive the pain inflicted by 
surgeons. We must atone. We must atone for 
our sins.

His eye is attracted to A LARGE LEVER seemingly separate from 
everything else. It's marked: SIREN. He pulls it.

LOGAN
We must...atone. We must.

136	EXT. THE SIREN HORN - NIGHT

Slowly, THE THROATY WAIL RISES and calls out over the jungle. It's 
the "Feeding Signal" we heard earlier.

137	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as everywhere in the jungle ZOMBIES turn toward the call of 
THE SIREN. They start to walk...toward the SOUND, toward the place 
where there is food.

138	INT. ENTRANCE SEVEN - NIGHT

JULIE is still screaming wildly. THE ZOMBIES ARE TEARING HER APART, 
LITERALLY.

DOC LOGAN inadvertently kicks THE PISTOL left by DIESEL and is 
skitters across the floor. He flops down on his knees.

LOGAN
WE WILL ATONE. WE WILL BE THE 
SACRIFICE...THE COMMUNION...WE OFFER 
OURSELVES UP...OUR SOUL...AND OUR BODIES...

JULIE GRANT finally loses consciousness. MANY MORE ZOMBIES are 
pressing in through the entrance now. They reach LOGAN and start to 
tear at him. Something clicks in his brain and he realises what's 
happening. He starts to scream. His hands find THE PISTOL on the 
floor.

ONE ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF HIS LEFT ARM. He shrieks and brings up 
THE PISTOL, FIRING. THE FIRST SHOT RIPS OPEN THE CREATURE'S SKULL. 
The next FIVE SHOTS are wasted, FIRED WILDLY. The GUN CLICKS emptily 
as THE ZOMBIES engulf him, TEARING, BITING, EATING HIM ALIVE.

MORE ZOMBIES come out of the jungle...a lot more...called by the 
SIREN. In waves they enter the Cave looking for food.

139	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

TRICKS is running through the hall with TWO BUDDIES. MARY HENRIED 
jumps out of the crowd.

MARY
Tricks! What's going on?

TRICKS
Toby's in the Cave. We're gonna make our 
move. There's rebels out to blow the powder 
magazine. Come on. Come with us.

MARY
Where are you goin' out?

TRICKS
Exit five.

MARY
See ya there.

She turns away and starts back in the direction she came from. TRICKS 
calls after her.

TRICKS
SEVEN MINUTES, MARY. EXACTLY SEVEN MINUTES!

140	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

RHODES AND EIGHT TROOPERS turn a corridor and there, before them, is 
a sight out of Dracula's tomb. Moving through the lava-stone arches, 
between the giant earthen pillars, is THE ARMY OF BLUE AND WHITE 
ZOMBIES. RHODES and his men can't possibly fight them, there are too 
many. RHODES spots A DOOR WITH A CAGED RED LIGHT OVERHEAD. They can 
get to it by slicing through only A FEW OF THE ADVANCING GHOULS.

RHODES
THIS WAY. OVER HERE! SHOOT! SHOOT THEM! 
SHOOT TO KILL! IN THE HEAD!

Their RIFLES BLAZE as they drive through the edge of THE ZOMBIE 
HORDE. SEVERAL OF THE CREATURES GO DOWN, THEIR HEADS BLASTED OPEN BY 
RAPID-FIRE ROUNDS.

ONE grabs RHODES by the sleeve of his jacket. The captain turns on 
his heels and stares at the thing with outraged disbelief. He raises 
his MAGNUM and pumps TWO QUICK SHELLS INTO THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.

THE PLATOON finally reaches the door. RHODES holds it open while his 
MEN run inside. He holsters his PISTOL and unslings his AUTOMATIC. 
THE ZOMBIES press towards him. He selects A FEW OF THE CLOSEST ONES, 
aims, and FIRES, with a look of enjoyment on his face. For a moment 
he resembles Doc Logan, madness bristling inside him.

THE ZOMBIES fall, THEIR HEADS SHATTERED, ONE OF RHODES' MEN calls 
from inside the doorway.

TROOPER
Captain...CAPTAIN!

RHODES FIRES ANOTHER QUICK BURST, then he turns and moves through the 
doorway.

141	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

SPIDER is walking along, careful to avoid jolts, support-under her 
arms by the giant DIESEL. JACK walks with them, his nervousness 
irritated by the need to move slowly. CITIZENS run past, none of them 
paying attention to the desperadoes.

Suddenly they encounter A TROOP OF SOLDIER who come trotting around a 
corner. Nervous JACK OPENS FIRE. TWO SOLDIER GO DOWN. A gunfight 
erupts as the rest of the TROOPS scatter in the hallway, CIVILIANS 
are caught in the crossfire. TWO ARE HIT.

DIESEL manages to steer SPIDER around a corner to safety. JACK keeps 
FIRING but he's trapped in A HAIL OF BULLETS. A RED LINE CUTS ACROSS 
HIS CHEST and he flies back, dead, his GUN STILL FIRING.

Out of the Troopers' sight, DIESEL checks his map and moves into A 
DOORWAY, one of several on the area, guiding SPIDER through beside 
him.

142	INT. ANOTHER MAINTENANCE SHAFT - NIGHT

They find themselves in one of those work corridors. The giant man 
shoulder his RIFLE and gently lifts SPIDER into his arms. He moves, 
as smoothly as he can, down the shaft and around a bend.

143	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

TOBY leads JOHN AND THE REBELS out into A HALLWAY. They break across 
to an opposite door. Before they can escape, A TROOP OF SOLDIERS 
appears. A GUNFIGHT ENSUES.

TWO SOLDIERS GO DOWN. JOHN IS WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER but he stays on 
his feet. THE SOLDIERS have them divided in the two opposite 
doorways.

Suddenly, TRICKS AND HIS BUDDIES come charging around a corner. THEY 
OPEN FIRE. THE SOLDIERS RESPOND. TWO MORE SOLDIERS GO DOWN. ONE OF 
TRICKS' MEN IS KILLED. TRICKS himself IS WOUNDED BADLY IN THE 
STOMACH.

Caught in a crossfire, THE LAST FOUR TROOPERS throw down their guns. 
They flee wildly down the corridor. THE REBELS pick up and file 
through one of the doors. TOBY rushes to aid his BADLY WOUNDED BUDDY.

TOBY
Tricks...Jesus...

TRICKS
I'm alright. Let's go.

They follow after the others.

144	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A SCREAM GOES UP! A WOMAN near the exit has spotted something 
terrifying in the hallway. THE GUARDS panic. ONE OF THEM OPENS FIRE.

145	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A MASS OF ZOMBIES COME SHUFFLING DOWN THE CORRIDOR. Their VOICES ECHO 
IN GROTESQUE HARMONY, the song of the living dead that we've heard 
before.

146	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

THE GUARDS are trying to close the entrance doors manually. The big 
slabs won't budge. Suddenly GASPARILLA appears. Drawing A PISTOL from 
A HOLSTER he wears, without warning he SHOOTS ONE OF THE GUARDS. THE 
OTHER GUARD flees.

GASPARILLA falls onto the dead man and rips off his ORANGE-CIRCLE 
VEST. THE ZOMBIES are pressing in now, into the gymnasium. GASPARILLA 
AND SEVERAL REMAINING PARTY-GOERS (none with vests) are trapped.

147	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY is running along with THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN. Suddenly, from 
out of a doorway, comes CAPTAIN RHODES WITH HIS STORM TROOPERS.

RHODES
HENRIED! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

Without answering, MARY leads her band through A MANUAL DOOR that 
leads to the Dormitory.

RHODES
STOP THEM! SHOOT!

SOLDIER
The...the children, sir.

RHODES
After them then! I want them stopped! That 
woman is dangerous!

148	INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY AND HER REFUGEES are stopped in their tracks by BUB AND HIS 
CADRE OF RED COATS. THE NURSE screams and tries to back away. THE 
CHILDREN cling to her, petrified, shrieking, starting to cry.

BUB lumbers up to MARY and...salutes. MARY returns the formality.

MARY
It's alright. I don't think they'll hurt 
us. Try to stay calm.

149	INT. THE OUTER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

THE MANUAL DOOR has been locked from inside.

RHODES
SHOOT IT OPEN!

THE SOLDIERS follow orders, TWO OF THEM FIRING AT THE LOCK.

150	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT

MARY is at A CABINET pulling out PISTOLS AND RIFLES, passing the 
weapons around to TONTO, BLUTO, SAMSON. BUB is strapping on his TWO-
GUN HOLSTER SET all by himself, fumbling a little, but succeeding.

151	INT. THE CORRIDOR WITH RHODES - NIGHT

RHODES' MEN kick open the door and charge into the Dormitory 
corridor.

152	INT. THE FIRING RANGE - NIGHT

THE NURSE slams ANOTHER MANUAL DOOR, locking and bolting it.

NURSE
They're coming! They're coming!

She hurries along the caged alley behind the firing stalls guiding 
THE CHILDREN to an opposite exit.

BLAM! BLAM! MARY IS FIRING at AN ORANGE CIRCLE VEST on one of the cut 
out target figures in the range. THE RED COATS are watching with 
curiosity, cocking their heads.

MARY moves to fire again but BLUTO grabs her hand.

MARY
NO...BLUTO...I'M TRYING TO...

The dumb creature keeps his grip. MARY has to appease to him. She 
grasps his hand and shakes vigorously. When he finally lets go, she 
aims her PISTOL again and FIRES AT THE VEST SEVERAL MORE TIMES.

MARY
Look. It's good to shoot the circles. Good. 
Good.

THE ZOMBIES are confused. Exasperated, MARY tears off her own vest 
and tosses it down the alley. THE RED COATS look befuddled, and a 
little angry. MARY FIRES at the vest she threw down. TWO BULLETS HIT 
IT before MARY'S PISTOL CLICKS...empty.

There's A POUNDING AT THE DOOR. It's RHODES AND HIS TROOP.

Suddenly BUB steps into position. WHAP! One of his famous quick 
draws! BLAM!!! HE FIRES. THE VEST ON THE FLOOR, MARY'S VEST, IS HIT. 
BUB FIRES AGAIN, the other gun this time. THE VEST ON THE TARGET IS 
HIT squarely in the center of its orange circle.

TONTO now turns. He lifts his PISTOL and FIRES. THE VEST ON THE 
TARGET IS HIT AGAIN, off center, but hit.

MARY
THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!

Suddenly THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE RANGE FLIES OPEN. THREE OF 
RHODES' MEN RUSH IN, wearing, of course, orange circles. THE RED 
COATS OPEN FIRE. THE TROOPERS ARE CUT TO RIBBONS. Others outside the 
door duck back behind the walls.

THE ZOMBIES lumber toward the open doorway, STILL FIRING AS THEY GO. 
MARY is backing away through the opposite exit. BUB sees her leaving. 
He calls to her with a deep, pleading moan. MARY stops and looks at 
him sadly. He shoots off a military salute. MARY salutes him back. 
There are tears in her eyes.

She turns and hurries off. BUB joins his fellows in pursuit of 
Rhodes' and his men.

153	INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A WOMAN'S FACE IS FULL SCREEN. She is screaming in agony as she is 
TORN APART BY ZOMBIES. The creatures have invaded the gymnasium. 
They're CLAWING AT THE FAT-CAT COUNCILLORS, MAULING THEIR WOMEN.

GASPARILLA AND TWO OTHER MEN are rolling around crazily, bumping into 
exercise machines, knocking over wine bottles and tables full of 
hors-d'oeuvres. The single vest they are fighting over rips apart 
into two pieces, its orange circle severed into two useless halves.

GASPARILLA backs across the floor, his blubber bouncing. He has a 
tattered piece of the vest clutched in his hands. He tries to spread 
it out on his chest but it's too late... and THE ZOMBIES are too 
hungry...much too hungry.

MONTAGE: as ALL OVER THE ROOM THEY STRIKE. This is it, gore fans. The 
gross finale. The intestine-tugger. THE ZOMBIES GET THEIR SUPPER. 
THEY FEAST AMONG THE PILLOWS, like Romans at an orgy. MUSIC still 
plays over the gymnasium speakers, rock-a-billy in a gleeful tempo.

GASPARILLA has retreated into his tanning-coffin but a pudgy arm and 
a leg are dangling outside. ZOMBIES CHEW HUNGRILY on the juicy 
morsels. From inside the coffin, where ultraviolet glows brightly, 
come the piercing, agonised screams of the fat General.

154	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

DIESEL guides SPIDER through the huge earthen archways. ZOMBIES here 
are scattered now, but they provide for delays. DIESEL FIRES and 
ZOMBIES ARE HIT but few are hit fatally. DIESEL'S free arm can't fire 
accurately while he's trying to support the walking bomb beside him.

DIESEL stops to check his map. A ZOMBIE looms up behind him and takes 
a HUGE BITE OUT OF HIS SHOULDER. DIESEL screams. He lets go of SPIDER 
who stumbles away from him, almost falling but saving herself. Her 
eyes are bugging with pain.

DIESEL FIRES POINT BLANK AT THE ZOMBIE, BLOWING ITS HEAD TO BITS. 
MORE CREATURES are pressing in close. DIESEL bats at one, kicks 
another, punches a third. Then he rushes to SPIDER'S side and scoops 
her into his arms again. Wincing in pain from THE BLEEDING WOUND IN 
HIS SHOULDER he manages to move out of immediate danger.

THE ZOMBIES lumber after the two, groaning in chorus as they walk.

155	INT. THE CORRIDOR AT EXIT FIVE - NIGHT

MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN come charging down the hall. TOBY, 
SARAH, AND JOHN are waiting for them near the open door which leads 
out into the jungle. TOBY AND MARY rush into each other's arms and 
they flee, with the others, out into the night.

156	INT. A CORRIDOR NEAR THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

RHODES AND HIS MEN rush into another corridor where they are met by a 
crowd of DROOLING ZOMBIES. THE MEN OPEN FIRE but the ZOMBIES are too 
close in. They get the upper hand.

RHODES FIRES HIS MAGNUM, his eyes insane, his face boiling red with 
disbelief. After TWO SHOTS BLAST OPEN THE HEADS OF THE CLOSEST 
ZOMBIES, THE MAGNUM just CLICK-CLICK-CLICKS! RHODES is out of lead.

He's grabbed by ONE ZOMBIE, then ANOTHER. He fights to free himself 
but HE'S BITTEN ONCE...TWICE...

BLEEDING, he fights on. He struggles to a doorway and pushes through.

157	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

RHODES comes face-to-face with...you guessed it...big BUB. THE ZOMBIE 
faces off, ready to draw those SIX-GUNS that hang at his hips. RHODES 
turns and runs.

WHAP! BUB slaps leather. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! RHODES turns a corner but 
ONE BULLET BITES HIM ON THE BACK OF HIS SHOULDER. Terrified, fighting 
pain, he staggers on with the gun-totin' RED COAT following behind.

158	EXT. THE JUNGLE - NIGHT

THE REBELS lead MARY, THE NURSE AND THE CHILDREN through the 
underneath. TRICKS is bleeding badly. TOBY helps him along. Suddenly, 
as they break into a clearing, SARAH stops cold. There on the ground, 
lying where we last saw it, is THE CORPSE OF MIGUEL.

JOHN
What is it?

SARAH
It's...he was...one who came to the island 
with me.

TOBY
Come on. No time.

SARAH
He was killed...five days ago.

MARY
Maybe...maybe he wasn't dead. Are you sure 
he was dead when you left him?

SARAH
Look at him. A hundred bullets. You tell 
me. Was he dead?

There are tears in SARAH'S eyes.

SARAH
Five days...and he hasn't...risen. He 
hasn't risen.

TOBY
Come on. There's no time. There's no time 
to lose.

THE GROUP pushes ahead. SARAH kneels. She blesses herself and makes 
the sign of the cross over the corpse. Then she stands to see that 
JOHN is waiting for her. He holds out his hand, she takes it and 
follows the others.

159	EXT. THE BACKWATER - NIGHT

THE SOLDIERS aboard THE FISHING BOAT hear NOISES coming from the 
surrounding jungle.

SOLDIER
WHO IS IT? WHO'S OUT THERE?

JOHN (o.s.)
WE WANT THE BOAT! DROP YER GUNS OR WE'LL 
BLAST YOU!

THE SOLDIERS hesitate, looking around at the dark jungle.

TOBY (o.s.)
WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED!

A SUDDEN BURST OF AUTOMATIC FIRE LIGHTS UP THE BLACK FOLIAGE. THE 
SOLDIERS react, flinging their WEAPONS over the side into the water.

THE REFUGEES spill out of the undergrowth and scramble over to the 
boat, lifting THE CHILDREN and THE WOUNDED TRICKS on board carefully.

JOHN pauses to look back into the jungle.

JOHN
Damn you, island. Damn you ta Hell and 
worse!

McDERMOTT
We ain't outa here yet. Get yer ass movin' 
ya dumb bastard.

McDERMOTT tries to slug from his flask, finds it empty. With a shrug 
he tosses the thing into the backwater. THE ENGINE STARTS as JOHN 
climbs aboard, SARAH AND TOBY giving him their hands.

160	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER WITH DIESEL AND SPIDER - NIGHT

161	INT. THE LABORATORY AREA WITH RHODES AND BUB - NIGHT

(These two sequences will be intercut for parallel action)

ZOMBIES are crawling all over DIESEL now. He fights them off 
valiantly but his super strength is waning. HE IS BITTEN AGAIN AND 
AGAIN but he tries to keep himself between THE CLUTCHING CREATURES 
AND THE LITTLE DEAF MUTE who is stumbling along ahead. She's getting 
very close to a huge SET OF CONCRETE SLABS...THE DOORS TO THE POWDER 
MAGAZINE.

Meanwhile RHODES approaches another corner in the hallway near the 
Conditioning Room. BUB follows, his boot heels CLICKING the way 
RHODES' own heels once clicked.

RHODES dives for the corner. BUB slaps leather and FIRES OFF ALL 
TWELVE. RHODES rolls on the ground crazily. HE'S HIT SEVERAL 
TIMES...but he's still alive. He pulls himself, in agony, out of 
range. Calmly, BUB dumps out his spent shells and starts to reload.

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, DIESEL IS OVERCOME, DRAGGED DOWN BY A MOB OF 
ZOMBIES. THEY START TO TEAR HIM APART BIT BY BIT.

SPIDER walks on alone. She is just a few feet from the POWDER 
MAGAZINE now. A ZOMBIE grabs her from behind but just gets a handful 
of shirt. SPIDER reaches forward but the creature holds her back. Her 
SHIRT IS RUNNING RIVERS OF BLOOD NOW where the vials are implanted 
underneath.

RHODES crashes through a doorway into THE CONDITIONING ROOM. He 
realises, too late, that there's no exit. BUB'S BOOTHEELS are getting 
LOUDER. RHODES crawls around behind THE TABLES FULL OF TESTING 
EQUIPMENT, WOODEN SHAPES, FLASH CARDS SCATTER. Over near the LARGE 
COLOURED SYMBOLS which are mounted on the wall there's A WEAPONS 
CABINET. RHODES grabs a chair and smashes open the glass.

BUB steps into the open doorway, still reloading his PISTOLS. He 
stands there, a golem, his fingers slowly, calmly working. He drops a 
shell or two but soon the barrels are filled with fresh loads.

RHODES reaches in through the broken glass and pulls out AN 
AUTOMATIC.

BUB slaps his PISTOLS back into their HOLSTERS and face off.

RHODES lifts the AUTOMATIC...aims...

BUB DRAWS! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EACH ONE OF THE TWELVE BULLETS HITS RHODES 
SOMEWHERE, many of them in the "kill-zones". He screams when the 
first few rounds hit, but his screaming stops about halfway through 
the barrage. That's when he dies. His leg bones support his corpse 
long enough for the last six bullets to reach him. Then, as THE SOUND 
OF BUB'S GUN ECHOES AWAY down the corridors, RHODES BODY slides down 
the wall and crumples to the floor in a heap, leaving MUCH OF HIS 
BLOOD on the ORANGE CIRCLE that's mounted behind him.

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER, A ZOMBIE TAKES A BITE OUT OF SPIDER'S SHOULDER. 
IT PULLS OUT A BIG CHUNK OF FLESH, AND WITH IT, STUCK IN THE 
CREATURE'S TEETH, COMES ONE OF THE NITRO VIALS.

SEVERAL ZOMBIES are pulling at the woman. She is still reaching for 
the POWDER MAGAZINE DOORS but the ghouls are pulling her away.

THE CREATURE WITH THE TEST TUBE IN ITS MOUTH pulls the bothersome 
thing out from between its teeth. It studies the vial curiously for a 
moment, then it tosses it angrily towards SPIDER, toward THE MAGAZINE 
DOOR...

KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

162	INT. THE MAIN CHAMBER (EFX) - NIGHT

A HALLACIOUS FIREBALL RIPS THROUGH THE CAVE.

163	INT. THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

BUB stands in the open doorway staring at RHODES' still twitching 
corpse. He slaps his SIX-GUNS back into their leather HOLSTERS, then 
he shoots off one of those military salutes of his....just as the 
walls fall in on him.

164	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

THE REFUGEES stare toward the island as A HUGE BOOOOOM FILLS THE 
NIGHT. Some of the YOUNGER CHILDREN start to cheer as though watching 
fireworks on the Fourth of July.

165	EXT. GASPARILLA'S ISLAND (THEIR P.O.V.) - NIGHT

THE TOP BLOWS OFF THE ISLAND, just as TOBY predicted is would. It's 
as though an enormous underground volcano is exploding. It's a 
frightening...yet beautiful sight.

166	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

TOBY looks back over his shoulder. THE NURSE is kneeling beside the 
body of TRICKS. He's dead. The woman pulls a blanket up over his 
head. TOBY steps forward, his PISTOL drawn. He pulls the hammer back 
and aims at TRICKS' head.

SARAH
No. Don't. Wait. Wait to see if... wait 
until it's necessary.

TOBY turns and looks at MARY. She nods. He releases the PISTOL HAMMER 
without firing.

DISSOLVE TO:

167	EXT. ANOTHER ISLAND (WIDE EST.) - MORNING

Gorgeous, a paradise. BIRDSONG fills the air.

168	EXT. A RIVER ON THE ISLAND - MORNING

THE REGUGEES are all gathered. THE CHILDREN walk, one by one, through 
the shallows as JOHN baptises them. SARAH, MARY AND THE NURSE carry 
the infants. When the infant in SARAH'S arms has been touched by 
JOHN'S hand, SARAH doesn't move on. Instead, she looks up into the 
big man's warm eyes.

SARAH
Me too...please.

JOHN gently cups a handful of river water and pours it on the woman's 
forehead.

THE OTHER ADULTS, led by LUKEY, file into the river, all lining up 
before the baptist, waiting their turns to be blessed into this tiny 
new society.

169	EXT. A BEACH ON THE ISLAND - MORNING

TRICKS' BODY lies covered in the sand. THE REFUGEES are gathered 
again, heads bowed, while JOHN speaks.

JOHN
Satan ain't sent this man back. Not yet, 
anyway. So we all hopin' that maybe he's up 
there with you, Lord. This might be the 
first decent soul we been able ta offer ya 
in quite a few years. That's a fact. We 
just gonna... pray, Lord. We gonna pray 
that what seems ta be happenin' here...is 
really happenin'...and I'm gonna take the 
chance and speak these words that I ain't 
been able ta speak for so long...

May he rest in peace

THE OTHERS
Amen.

170	EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

THE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE 
in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene.

SARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body. 
JOHN steps in behind and she startles.

JOHN
Just me. I'll take the next shift.

He settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at 
the shrouded corpse.

SARAH
How long do we have to watch him?

JOHN
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta 
dust and blows away on the wind.

THE BODY lies silent, rigid under the KHAKI ARMY BLANKET that rises 
and falls, rises and falls with the Gulf breeze.

Suddenly...A LOUD MUSIC CHORD! A SUDDEN MOVEMENT!

It's the movement of RED LETTERS that spin up off the head of the 
corpse and settle before our eyes.

The letters read: "THE END (I PROMISE)"

               An enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the
               water. An autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost
               futuristic in its design. The nose cone is an amazing ultra
               high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING along the side tells us
               this is the "SHINKAI 90000."

               The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and
               barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors
               work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The
               JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic
               position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation
               of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate
               DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and
               dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS
               as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth
               gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks.

         4     ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4

               The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes
               widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below
               sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS,
               HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.

               As it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums
               leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths,
               away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops
               into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty
               thousand feet of water. 

               But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon.

               Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm.

               The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an
               enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone

               THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC
               ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its "hand" is a
               high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies,
               then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock
               into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern. 

               Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the
               cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and
               sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side.

               A desolate, barren, spooky place. Nothing breathes. Nothing
               lives. Or so it would appear. The creepy, foreboding MUSICAL
               SCORE tells us otherwise. The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK
               FISSURE.

         8     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     8

               The Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi
               dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN
               TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then,
               dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked
               by a rock-encrusted embankment. 

               The MUSIC builds. 

               The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide
               up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized
               by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And
               the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. 

               As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is
               filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here
               and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of
               several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark
               cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. 

               The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just
               stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.

               The vessel cruises through the valley of death. Everyone is
               nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting
               equipment. 

               Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking.

               Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi
               dome. Giant skeletons everywhere.

               The Shinkai approaches an eerie-looking rock formation. The
               robotic arm comes out. The laser cutter steadies, aims, then
               shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock.

               WHOOSH!! A HUGE JET STREAM OF INKY BLOOD BLASTS OUT OF THE
               FORMATION!

               The Captain and the Science Officers recoil as the inky stuff
               envelopes the plexi-dome, completely blotting out the VIEW.

               The Shinkai VANISHES into a huge cloud of inky blood. We HOLD
               for a LONG OMINOUS BEAT. And then, like a slow-motion
               earthquake, large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift
               in the murky waters. WHALE BONES TOPPLE and SCATTER. Several
               feet under the ancient silt, something is coming alive.

               Everything outside the plexi-dome is still BLACK. Everyone is
               staring at the position board, which shows a large section of
               the OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE, its contours incongruous
               with the rest of the graphic representation. 

               The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks
               commands. The Crew leaps into high gear. 

               Then the Captain reverses the trottle, and petal-to-the-metal
               he starts to back out. 

               The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome. Then suddenly, and
               impossibly, the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes
               ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS
               BREAKS. Lots of YELLING in Japanese. 

               The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on
               it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it
               stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead
               quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is
               HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing
               across the outside of the hull. Very creepy. 

               The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.
               And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can.
               The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP.
               WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING
               DIMPLES, CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM.
               And then the SHINKAI IMPLODES. A massive CHURNING SWIRL of
               water, metal and men.

               etched on his rugged, good looking face, is harnessed into
               the steering pylon, wrestling with his steering-sticks,
               holding the bouncing jetfoil steady as he can, hauling ass,
               propelled, it seems, by the music blasting out of four state
               of the art speakers bolted to the metal walls. Light from the
               laser imagers plays across Finnegan's face. The face of a man
               in his element, on the edge, in control. He barks commands
               into his RADIO HEADSET.

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see LEILA, a muscular Filipina
               clambering over the foredeck. She's dripping wet. Tough as
               nails. She turns to Finnegan and "mouths" something into her
               headset. Finnegan flashes her his most charming smile.

                         Yes, I'm very warm and dry in here,
                         thank you for your concern.

               His HEADSET comes alive withe the SOUND of LEILA bitching in
               an unintelligible foreign tongue.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         A raise? I already pay you two
                         bucks a day.

               He watches as Leila fights the WIND and SEASPRAY and dogs
               tight a series of hatch-latches across the foredeck.

               Wearing a mechanic's toolbelt, slung sideways across the hips
               like a gunslinger, singing the theme to "Gilligan's Island"
               over the engine's roar. Way off-key. His hands crammed deep
               in a tangle of wires. On the walls are a few pictures: Of a
               few major league engines. Of a few major league pinups, and a

               As Finnegan is watching the sea ahead, swathed in the
               shrieking Clapton guitar solos, the hatch opens. 

               Hanover enters, followed by Mason, who leaves the hatch door
               ajar. 

               Finnegan's eyes remain fixed on the sea. His ears on the
               Clapton. 

               Hanover and Mason hold onto any available rail as the boat
               slams over the waves.

                                   HANOVER
                         You remember the first time we met
                         Finnegan? I think you were just
                         starting out...smuggling gold off
                         Sumatra for those two
                         Chinese...what did we use to call
                         them?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we
                         strolling down memory lane for any
                         particular reason?

                                   HANOVER
                         No, it just struck me as odd...I
                         don't see you for all these years
                         and you've still got the same tape
                         stuck in the box.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You know what they say...the
                         classics are eternal.

               Hanover looks at the Topo Imager. Holding onto the rail to
               keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea.

                                   HANOVER
                         So where are we?

               Finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Right here...middle of nowhere...

                                   HANOVER
                         And where is our point of arrival?

               Finnegan points to another spot on the map.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Right here...middle of
                         nowhere...and the answer to your
                         question is yes.

                                   HANOVER
                         Which question is that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The one you came up to ask...are we
                         on schedule?

                                   HANOVER
                             (to Mason)
                         Take note Mr. Mason...this is why
                         you hire a professional...No
                         whining. No excuses.

                             (attitude)
                         I've heard a lot of stories about
                         you mate...

                         All of them flattering I'm sure.

                                   MASON
                         They were...but they musta been
                         talking about another Finnegan...
                         because the one I heard about was
                         as rough as they came...the one I'm
                         looking at is, well, about as
                         current as the music.

                                   HANOVER
                         Don't mind him Finnegan...you
                         remember 25...balls of steel...
                         splashing around in a sea of
                         testosterone.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't mind him...but I do think
                         it's time for him to get back down
                         below with the rest of the
                         playgroup.

                                   MASON
                         And who's gonna make me?

               Finnegan looks at Mason...at the open hatchway just behind
               him...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The Finnegan you heard about.

               ...and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead. The force
               of acceleration tumbles Hanover into the console. Mason
               tumbles out the open hatchway, down the stairs behind him. As
               he rises, Hanover regards Finnegan for a moment. A smile
               flits across his face.

                                   HANOVER
                         That's why we're sill around
                         Finnegan...you and me... Nothing
                         gets the feathers up. Business is
                         business. Eh?

               Finnegan's hand finds the console. He hits a button. The
               first strains of Led Zepplin's WHOLE LOTTA LOVE comes roaring
               out of the speakers.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         And the classics are eternal.

               Finnegan cranks the sound to the max, pulls back on both
               steer sticks, and holds on, as the force of acceleration
               hammers him into the pylon.

               The Saipan roars off into the setting sun, hell bent for
               leather. Zepplin screaming in its wake.

               luxury cruise liner. The FUJI MARU. Top of the line. State of

               Breathtaking. Gunfire shatters the serenity of the night.

               A group of tony British passengers is shooting skeet. Being
               night, the CLAY PIGEONS are glow-in-the-dark. They EXPLODE
               over the WATERSPORTS PLATFORM, where TWO JET SKIS swing from
               harnesses, and TWO SPEEDBOATS are being hoisted up the side.

               Rigged for a formal party. Chinese lanterns sway in the
               breeze. A band plays. Hundreds of wealthy Passengers, the men
               in tuxedos, the women in drop dead gowns, dripping with
               jewelry, dance, flirt, gossip, as an endless stream of
               waiters ply the floor with champagne laden trays.
               CLOSE ON: The sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the
               foot of a woman, stopping at the top of the deck. PAN UP: A
               shimmering golden gown, high slit on the sides to reveal a
               perfect set of legs, a runway model's body, a cover girl's
               face...and a thief's sharp ferret eyes. TRILLIAN. A class act
               from top to bottom. A head turner for either sex, and knows
               it. She holds an orchid in her hand. Trillian scans the
               crowd, looking for her prey...and finds him. Her POV. The
               Ship's smug Captain. JEAN BAPTISTE DELCROIX. She fixes the
               orchid in her hair just so, about to move...

                                   OLD WOMAN
                         He said an orchid and a beautiful
                         woman belonged together... It was
                         our first date.

               Trillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed
               impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except
               from her eyes. Kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the
               night.

                                   OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                         He said that it was the orchid I
                         wore that made him fall in love
                         with me...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         He sounds like a real gentleman.

                                   OLD WOMAN
                         The best of the best he was... This
                         cruise was supposed to be our 60th
                         anniversary gift to each other. He
                         died last Spring...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I'm so sorry...

                                   OLD WOMAN
                         I was going to wear one...special
                         for him...like a memory...

               The Old Woman looks at the orchid. And then at Trillian.

                                   OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                         But without him here I don't know
                         why I should.

               Trillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the
               lapel of the woman's jacket.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Because an orchid and a beautiful
                         woman belong together.

               The smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving,
               sincere. The moment between them is broken by the keen clear
               sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute.

                                   CANTON (V.O.)
                         Ladies and gentlemen...

               ANGLE ON: The deck where the band stops playing. Voices hush.
               Everyone turns to NIGEL CANTON, 65, tall, elegant, every
               white hair perfectly in place, impeccably turned out, with
               the energy, and enthusiasm of a man half his age. Canton
               stands at the head of the pool, in front of a wall sized
               aquarium, flanked by his Captain.

               The crowd swells around Canton. ANGLE ON: The Captain
               chatting up some passengers when a woman's voice, seductive,
               beguiling, turns his head to...

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (French)
                         Is it true what they say about a
                         captain and his boat.

               The Captain's libido rises as he gazes into Trillian's come
               hither eyes.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Is what true madame?

               Trillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are
               pursed inches from the captain's.

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (French)
                         Madamoiselle...that the bigger the
                         boat...the bigger the man... 

               His breath catches.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         It is a theory I would be glad to
                         put to the test.

               Trillian draws even closer. If looks could cause a man to
               climax.

                                   TRILLIAN

               ANGLE ON: Trillian, turning from the captain into the crowd.
               C.U. on her hand by the side of her dress. A man's wallet
               held surreptitiously. Her fingers open the wallet, extract a
               thin gold card with a black stripe. She discards the wallet,
               keeps the card, and disappears into the crowd.

                         Ruin my party? Captain, this ship
                         was built to withstand a typhoon. I
                         can't imagine there's anything on
                         the sea today that could possibly
                         ruin my party.

               Pantucci in the storage hold, surrounded by half a dozen
               crates, his wily eyes popped wide with apprehension. He licks
               his lips nervously, looks around and whispers into his
               headset.

               A hand falls on his shoulder, spinning him around to a fist

               wiping her dripping wet, magnificently ripped body, with a

               A massive fist plows into Pantucci's stomach. He drops from
               the arms of MULLIGAN, a scar-faced Irishman with a buzz cut.
               As quickly as he is doubled over he is yanked up straight by
               the man who hit him, VIVO, a merciless Maori, covered by
               tattoos, topped off with venom.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         You know what my goal is? Before I

                         from every country on earth.

                         Mr. Billy you're in the batter's
                         box.

               Hanover watches calmly as BILLY, the Aborigine, cracks his
               fist against the side of Pantucci's head, knocking him out of
               Vivo's arms.

                                   BILLY
                         At home we denosy the nosy.

               BILLY hoists Pantucci. He draws his knife under Pantucci's
               bloody nose.

                                   HANOVER

                         Chin...

               The Chinese merc steps forward, and whaps Pantucci upside the
               head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick. Pantucci hits the
               wall hard, crumbling. Chin lifts him.

               Massive Mason steps forward.

                                   MASON
                         I'll take a go and the I vote we

                         I vote we slit his throat THEN
                         throw him overboard...

               Mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm
               back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face. He never gets the
               punch off. His arm is caught from behind. He looks over his
               shoulder to Finnegan. Gripping his wrist. Right in his face.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         ...this is not a democracy. You
                         don't get a vote.

               Mason, enraged, swings with his free hand. Finnegan twists
               his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall,
               knocking the big man senseless. The other mercenaries go to
               draw their weapons. Before the guns are out of holsters,
               Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanover's face, an inch from
               his eye.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

                         impaired...

               Finnegan cocks the spear. CLICK! Hanover does not blink.
               Everyone freezes. With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci
               to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. Finnegan backs
               out of the room.

                         This isn't right Finnegan. I've got

                         He did...with a crowbar...you know
                         the rules on a broken contract.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I know it...but you want to get
                         where you want to get, and back? I
                         need a chief engineer, and unless
                         you got a replacement, I'd highly
                         recommend overlooking the
                         indiscretion.

               With that Finnegan leads Pantucci out of the hold, slamming
               the door behind him.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Thanks...

               Finnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci. It makes the smaller man
               quiver.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You put me in that position again
                         I'll throw you overboard myself.

               Finnegan stalks off. Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means
               it.

               A man strides down the hall of an executive passageway, his
               face obscured in shadows. He has a CANISTER in his hands.

               arrives at an ultra-high-tech CONSOLE. The cerebellum. Three

               unscrews the middle canister. Screws his canister into its
               place. Sets the TIMER to 0:300 hours. Pushes a button. The

               Trillian consults a list, looking for one very specific vault
               box.
               Finding it, she pulls a lock pick from her fabulous coiffure,
               and picks the lock in nothing flat. A pro. Flipping open the
               box, Trillian removes the only thing she came for. A dazzling
               diamond ring with the center stone the size of an egg. With a
               twist, she pops the stone from the setting, holds it up to
               admire it in the light...

               He slaps her across the face. Trillian flushes, touches the
               drop of blood at her lip...and decks the Captain with a
               vicious right cross.

               of fruit and vegetables.

               The top of another wooden crate is popped revealing the

               WAVE EXPLODES, as if THRASHED from below.
               Then another WAVE EXPLODES, forty feet to the right. Then
               ANOTHER, eighty feet to the left. And then ALMOST SEEN: Huge,
               black, ominous THINGS seem to be SQUIRMING beneath the water.

               another page.

               A LONG SCARY BEAT.

               And then suddenly -- She SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY and gives a sharp

               Scattering stuff off the counter. She tries to SCREAM, but it

               Mayhem... Fire spews out of the engines. Pantucci sprays a
               fire extinguisher frantically. Where the shrapnel entered the
               hull water now spurts with every wave. Smoke and water, oil
               and fire.

               TRACK WITH Finnegan running through the smoke filled hold,
               past Hanover and the merc's who are pulling themselves off
               the floor, right into the...

               ENGINE ROOM. Where Pantucci is beside himself in smoke and
               sputtering flame.

                         driving this thing?

               Finnegan notices something on the floor. He picks up a shard
               of the speedboat propeller. Strange. Hanover steps into the
               room.

                         We ran into a speedboat...

               He shows the piece of speed boat to Hanover. Who stares at
               it. Finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes.

                         things...screw your schedule!

               Mason grabs Pantucci by the throat, lifting him off the
               ground.

                         You little weasel!

               Finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of
               Mason's knees buckling him to the floor. In the blink of an
               eye there is the barrel of a .45 pressed hard against his
               head, Hanover at the trigger end.

                         Then you better start swimming.

               Hanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of
               the gun. Finnegan's head spins. He touches the corner of his
               mouth, and comes away with blood, and a look of murder in his
               eyes. Hanover slams a round in the chamber.

               BAM! BAM! Two grappling hooks fly from the barrels of the two
               catapults bolted to the deck, landing on the deck of the Fuji

               A thick black hose weaves it's way across the flooded floor,

               blast visor, stripped down to her skivvies, wields a welder
               against the gaping hole in the hull. As the boat dips in the

        67     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                               67

               Hanover, Mason, and Chin set foot on the deserted pool deck.

               FLASH TO: The pool deck is jammed with people partying. The
               band playing. Two kids toss a beach ball back and forth. The
               ball flies over one boy's head... 

               FLASH BACK TO: The ball falls into the empty pool...Where the
               band's instruments litter the bottom along a big jagged
               crack.

                                   MASON
                         What the...

               Uneasy, Hanover and his men look around at the over turned
               chairs. The smashed aquarium. Chin bends down and picks up a
               small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium. The
               squid wraps its tentacles around Chin's hand almost
               immediately. Chin regards it with curiosity.

               ...and then the yowl freezes them. C.U. on Hanover's face.
               His eyes flicker with uncertainty...and a tinge of fear.

               spectacular atrium, full of elegant well-dressed people
               laughing, chatting. 

               DING! FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Vivo, Pantucci, and Finnegan,
               standing amidst the shattered glass and broken furniture,
               whirling to the elevator door opening. Mulligan, nerves
               ajangle, and Vivo, swing their pulse rifles up hard as the
               door opens to reveal...and empty elevator! DING! The door
               closes. The car starts to ascend in the eerie silence. The
               mercs watch it go with growing uneasiness.

               The door to the bridge is KICKED OPEN. Mason and Chin leap
               inside. Guns out front. On edge. The overhead lights flicker
               on and off. The imager screens are all black. The STEERING
               WHEEL slowly ROCKS. As if an invisible captain is steering a
               ghost ship. Hanover ENTERS. Eyes shifting. Suspicious, and a
               bit nervous.

               Mulligan leads Finnegan, Pantucci, Vivo into the casino. The
               place looks like a mess. Tables and chairs are upended.
               Glasses and bottles are shattered everywhere. And there's
               BLOOD on the floor. 

               A BELL RINGS LOUDLY and the TROLLEY CAR STARTS TO MOVE!

                                   ELECTRONIC VOICE
                         Next stop, Chinatown!

               Everyone jumps, freaked. Mulligan and Vivo spin around and
               OPEN FIRE. Start BLOWING the shit out of the TROLLEY CAR. The
               GUNS sound like nothing we've ever heard. ROLLING THUNDER.
               Absolutely deafening.

               The GUNFIRE ECHOES through the hull. Suddenly, with a loud
               SPLASH, a sixteen-foot-long LIFEBOAT pops to the surface.
               Then another LIFE BOAT POPS UP. Then ANOTHER. Then THREE MORE
               off to the port side. Then TWO MORE off to the starboard.
               It's as if the SOUND of the GUNFIRE is somehow releasing the
               boats from their watery graves. They start to drift away.
               Spooky quiet.

               BULLETS RAKE the Trolley's metal sides. The WINDSHIELD
               EXPLODES. Finnegan yells at Mulligan and Vivo --

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Guys!! Whoa! WHOA! WHOA! WHOOOAAA!!

               Finnegan finally tilts the muzzle of Mulligan's gun to the
               ceiling. They stop firing. A little wigged-out. Their
               professional demeanor going by the boards. All goes quiet.
               They look at Finnegan, who is the picture of calm.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Guys...get a grip.

               The Trolley car reverses. The ELECTRONIC VOICE is now CRACKED
               --

                                   ELECTRONIC VOICE
                         Next stop, Fisherman's Wharf.

               Mulligan whirls, his gun poised. Just then his headset
               crackles.

               Finnegan leans in towards Mulligan's mike.

               Mulligan pulls the radio away.

               Hanover looks around at the empty bridge, the blinking
               lights.

                                   HANOVER
                         Stay to the schedule. Stay to the
                         plan. Nothing has changed.

               But the look in Hanover's slightly unnerved eyes tells a
               different story.

                                                       CUT TO:

        74     FUGI MARU STORAGE ROOM - DAY                            74

               Trillian goggily crawls out from under a mound of boxes. Her
               left eye's got a nice purple shiner. Her elegant gown is
               ripped. 

               A VERY STRANGE SOUND coming from behind the wall. Wet. Gooey.
               Slithery. Ominous. 

               Trillian freezes.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Hello?

               The SOUND slowly MOVES across the wall. Then another WALL
               starts to GURGLE. Trillian spins around. She forces herself
               not to panic. Very cautiously, taking small measured steps
               she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it.
               No go. 

               The gurgling ripples above her. Her mouth goes dry as her
               eyes follow the sound across the ceiling. Her hand goes to
               her hair. She pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels
               down until she is eye level with the door lock. She begins to
               pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling
               above. Suddenly the sound stops. The silence makes Trillian's
               heart sound that much louder. She sidles close to the wall.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Hello?

               Still silence. Cautious, she taps on the wall. For a moment
               nothing. And then... 

               WHAMM!! 

               Something slams against the wall from the other side in
               response. Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in
               her throat.

               Dark. Damp. Eerie. Ominous. Mulligan and Vivo, looking more
               nervous by the moment, lead the way. Finnegan and Pantucci
               follow.

                         league...go to the ball games...

               Finnegan turns to Pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost
               kind.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...it's okay...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What? You don't think I can have a
                         normal life?

                         Joey...look at me...

               He forces Pantucci to look him in the eyes.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         We're gonna get what we gotta
                         get... do what we gotta do...and
                         get the hell outta here...okay?

               Pantucci draws his strength from Finnegan. He forces himself
               to take a deep breath.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Okay...

               Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across
               the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the
               wall.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What the...???

               He and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes. The red dots of
               their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. Nothing.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Come on...the sooner we get outta
                         here the better I'll feel. Mulligan
                         and Vivo move forward.

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (quiet)
                         Finnegan...

               Finnegan turns to Pantucci, who has not moved from where he
               hit the wall.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         It's okay...come on...

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (scared)
                         I'm stuck...

               Pantucci tries to pull away from the wall. He is stuck.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (jumpy)
                         Hey! What are you trying to pull!

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (pleading)
                         John...

               Finnegan takes Pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring
               Mulligan.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Relax your arms...slowly...that's
                         it...

               As Finnegan pulls, Pantucci does as he is told. He slips away
               from the wall. The jacket doesn't.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What the...

               He reaches out to touch the wall. Finnegan grabs his wrist,
               grabs a flashlight from Vivo's utility belt and shines it on
               the wall. Their POV -- the entire wall is covered in a
               strange, yellow, secreted GELATIN. Laid on in some sort of
               weird, inhuman, geometric pattern. Like a spider web.

               LEILA SCREAMS. Bloody murder. Scared shitless. Quickly backs
               away. Actually, it's only half a corpse. The bottom half

                                                       CUT TO:

        78     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     78

               Leila trembles in the waist-high water. The PUMP'S HEARTBEAT
               seems to have gotten louder. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Leila slowly starts edging her way around the corpse. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Her eyes are transfixed, staring at the abomination, too
               scared to scream. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Her back is to the gaping hole as she slowly starts to pass
               in front of it. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               The water swirls around her waist. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               She's almost past the gaping hole now. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK... 

               Then something grabs her! She SCREAMS! And falls back towards
               the gaping hole -- But it's only a twisted piece of metal off
               a strut. She exhales. Relieved. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Suddenly, LEILA'S whole body SPASMS. She SCREECHES wildly, in
               great pain. The she's RIPPED backward out through the gaping
               hole. Gone. WATER SLOSHES back in. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.

                                                       CUT TO:

        79     FUJI MARU MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT                          79

               Knee deep in water, an edgy Mulligan watches Finnegan as he
               disassembles pieces of a thermal carburetor from an auxiliary
               generator. His eyes keep shifting around.
               Over in the far corner Vivo is watching Pantucci working over
               a metal lathe, repairing the cylinder head. Metal-on-metal.
               Vivo sits up on a barrel, trying to keep his feet out of the
               water.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The hulls of these things are
                         supposed to be impregnable...

                                   MULLIGAN
                         So?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         So...If the hull's impregnable why
                         are my feet wet?

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Why don't you just stop figuring
                         and keep working so we can get the
                         hell out of here?

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Why don't you help us so we can get
                         done faster so we can get the hell
                         out of here?

                                   MULLIGAN
                         'Cause grease monkey ain't in my
                         job description dick head...

               Vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel.

                                   VIVO
                         What I want to know is why the
                         goddamn ocean is always
                         cold...since I'm a kid I hate god
                         damn cold water.

               Then out of the corner of his eye, Vivo sees SOMETHING MOVE.
               He spins around. Nothing but pipes and hoses.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (nervous)
                         What was that?

                                   VIVO
                         Nothing.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Someone's back there.

                                   VIVO
                         Hey! Come out here!

               Finnegan and Pantucci stop working. All eyes are focused on
               the maze of pipes. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING and RUMBLING.
               Nothing moves.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Check it out!

                                   VIVO
                         Hey! You hear me? Come out! Still
                         no response.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Will you check it the hell out!!

               Disgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly.

                                   VIVO
                         Man this shit is cold!

               He walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. His pulse rifle
               rising.

                                   VIVO (CONT'D)
                         I'm gonna kick your ass for putting
                         me through this...

               Then he hears a strange SLURPING and SUCKING SOUND coming
               from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway.

                                   VIVO (CONT'D)
                         I'm not screwing around with you
                         man...I hate the cold water.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What is it man?

                                   VIVO
                         I'm looking...

               Vivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading
               down the little alleyway. He looks behind some pipes. The
               SLURPING gets LOUDER. Then he sees it. His eyes widen --

                                   VIVO (CONT'D)
                         On shit!

               And that's the last thing he ever says. Because just then,
               from a dark area between the pipes, SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT!

               Mulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement
               as Vivo is viciously YANKED into the pipes.
               A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall.
               Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Vivo!! Vivo!!

               As Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads
               for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. Mulligan swings around.
               KACHUNK!! His rifle is armed. The laser dot fixes on
               Finnegan's forehead.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Touch it and you're dead, asshole!

               Finnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What happened to Vivo?! What the
                         hell happened to Vivo?

               Everybody's breathing hard. Freaked out. Major tension. Blood
               drips down the wall.

                                                       CUT TO:

        80     VAULT ROOM - NIGHT                                      80

               Trillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit
               nervous, something is definitely not right here.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Helloooo?

               She shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut
               dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card. She is
               about to run it through the reader slot when...

               V.O.

               Ahem... She spins to...Hanover, Mason, Mamooli and Chin.
               Looking grim.

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (recovering)
                         I'm sorry... This area is for
                         authorized personnel only. As the
                         assistant to the Purser, I'm afraid
                         I'll have to ask you to vacate...

               Mason and Chin lift their pulse-rifles. KACHUNK!!

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Or maybe not.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where is everybody? 

               Trillian is confused --

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What do you mean?

               Hanover steps forward, right in her face.

                                   HANOVER
                             (threatening)
                         I mean...where is everybody?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Poolside?

               Hanover grabs Trillian by the throat and slams her against
               the wall. He rams his gun against her forehead.

                                   HANOVER
                         You tell it straight or I pull the
                         trigger. Who are you?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (choking)
                         A passenger...

               Hanover blinks.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where are the other passengers?

               Trillian shrugs. Mason grabs the card out of her hand.

                                   MASON
                         Forget her...let's get what we came
                         for and get the hell out of here!

               Mason runs the card through the slot. The ELECTRONICS KICK
               IN. LIGHTS FLASH. TUMBLERS ROLL. CLICK! It unlocks. Hanover's
               HEADSET comes alive with Mulligan SCREAMING.

                                   HANOVER
                         Mulligan?? What?? I can't hear
                         you?? Repeat I...

               -- Mason JERKS the vault door open. A FIRE-AXE SWING DOWN
               into his head, WHUMP! Kills him instantly. Eyes wide open.
               Everybody freaks out. Jumps back. Hanover lets go of
               Trillian, and stares into the vault directly at Nigel Canton.
               Holding the axe.

                                   CANTON
                         Oh my God. I didn't mean to...

               Behind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain,
               his clothes are ripped up, REVEALING nasty looking RED SCARS,
               blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         I thought it was one of them!

               Chin jams his rifle to the middle of Canton's forehead, and
               cocks a round into the chamber.

                                   HANOVER
                         Stand down soldier!

               But this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order.
               Hanover grabs Chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal
               yank.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         I said...

               He slams Chin against the wall. In the process he loses his
               headset.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Stand down!!

               Chin and Hanover stare at each other, their chests heaving.
               Mason finally drops to the ground. All she wrote.

                                   CANTON
                         I didn't mean to! I though it was
                         one of them!

                                   HANOVER
                         One of who?!

                                                       CUT TO:

        81     MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT                                    81

               The machinery is sputtering, and sparking, shorting, steaming
               as the sea rises. Mulligan, in a panic, has backed Finnegan
               and Pantucci into a corner. He screams over his headset.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Hanover!...Hanover! Come in! Come
                         in you son-of-a-bitch!

               No response. A sucking sound comes from the dark mass of
               pipes. Mulligan spins.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Hanover!! Hanover!!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Forget them...

               Mulligan spins back to Finnegan and Pantucci.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (fried)
                         Shut up! You hear me!!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         ...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Shut up, man, just shut the hell
                         up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What's there to think about?? That
                         THING back there...

                                   MULLIGAN
                         There ain't no thing here!! No
                         thing!! There's you him and me!!
                         Got it! You him and...

               Suddenly, Mulligan's LEGS are suddenly JERKED OUT from under
               him. He hits the floor hard. Starts FIRING WILDLY. 

               Finnegan and Pantucci hit the watery deck. 

               BULLETS RICOCHET everywhere. Mulligan is WHIPPED across the
               floor. SCREAMING in fear. His pulse-rifle goes flying. He's
               SLAMMED into a metal pylon, then SUCKED into a dark void in
               the pipes. All in the blink of an eye. 

               Finnegan grabs Mulligan's pulse-rifle. OPENS FIRE. BLASTING
               the shit out of anything and everything that moves.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Grab the parts!!

               Pantucci grabs the knapsack, cramming as many parts as he can
               into it as Finnegan keeps firing into the steaming, creaking,
               sparking machinery.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         I'll cover! Move! Move!

               Pantucci doesn't have to be told twice. He runs like hell,
               with Finnegan firing a final burst, and following.

                                                       CUT TO:

        82     VAULT - NIGHT                                           82

               Everyone hears the MASSIVE GUNFIRE. Hanover looks around for
               the source of the sound. He finds it in his discarded
               headset.

                                   HANOVER
                         This is Red one! Come in Red two!

               The gunfire stops, replaced by an ominous, horrifying,
               sucking sound.

                                   CANTON
                             (panicked)
                         It's them! We've got to get off!

               He runs out of the vault. The Captain follows close behind.
               Hanover listens to the sucking sound getting louder and
               louder.

                                   HANOVER
                         Let's find them!

                                   CHIN
                         What about the vault?

                                   HANOVER
                         It's not going anywhere...

               Hanover rushes out with Chin right behind. 

               Only Trillian remains, breathing deeply, scared...but not
               scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the
               first place. She goes right to the vault, opens one of the
               boxes, removes the giant diamond, drops it down her
               decolletage, pulls her high heels off, and runs out.

                                                       CUT TO:

        83     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     83

               Finnegan and Pantucci run to the end of a long section of
               metal grating, right below a staircase, to catch their
               breath. Everything has gone dead quiet, except for the
               billowing and clanging of the engines. Smoke and sparks
               obscure their vision.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Finnegan, what the hell was that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't know...you got what we
                         need?

                                   PANTUCCI
                         If I don't, I ain't going back to
                         get it...you think we're safe?

               Both of them listen to the silence. And then, at the far end
               of the grating, one grate rises...and falls. Finnegan and
               Pantucci watch, transfixed. Then, like a locomotive gathering
               speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and
               faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two
               of them.

               LOUDERFASTERLOUDERFASTER!!!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Come on!!

               Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they
               can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and
               falls. Silence returns. Except for the steaming, creaking
               machinery...and an ominous sucking sound.

                                                       CUT TO:

        84     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                      84

               Trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight
               elevator. Looking over her shoulder, she hits the button. The
               elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to
               hold a dozen people. Trillian rushes in and hits the up
               button. She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors
               close...until the elevator starts going down.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Up!! I want to go up!

               She panics. And starts pushing the up button frantically, her
               heart pounding in her chest.
               There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator
               descending...until something drops on the roof with a THUMP!
               Trillian screams. The elevator comes to a bumps stop.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         No...No...

               Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then
               the car starts to move again.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Go up...please go up!

               Trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail.
               The car continues its inexorable descent. Finally, in
               desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. The elevator
               stops. The emergency SIREN WHINES. A LONG BEAT. Nothing
               moves...and then...

               WHAM! Something beats on the roof, trying to break in. And
               again -- WHAM! The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its
               descent. Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the
               ceiling, scared. The ELEVATOR DINGS! 

               Startled, TRILLIAN SCREAMS. The DOORS start to OPEN.
               Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a
               high heel. The DOORS OPEN. -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN! Trillian
               swings her high heel...right into Pantucci's face! 

               Finnegan plows in right behind him.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         OWWW!! OOWWW!!!

               Trillian tries to run out. Finnegan grabs her.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I'm not staying here!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         It ain't any better out there!

               Trillian struggles. Finnegan does not let go of her.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Lady, I'm telling you...

               Trillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegan's
               hand, breaking his grip.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         OWW!

               Just then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts
               to ascend.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Now look what you did!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I saved your life is what I did!

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Who asked you to!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What the hell's going on here?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You're with that other bunch,
                         right?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         What other bunch?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         The thieves.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'm not a thief.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Then who are you?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'm their ride. 

               Trillian hears music to her ears.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You have a boat?

               Her demeanor changes, her voice goes to honey.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Finnegan!

               Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at
               the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the
               ceiling. All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the
               ceiling...followed by a sucking sound.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         It's up there!!

               Finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling. The
               sucking sound stops.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not anymore.

               The elevator stops. DING! The door opens. Finnegan whirls his
               rifle, rising. Trillian lifts her high heel, ready to
               strike... 

               Hanover, Chin, and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on
               the car. The Captain and Canton quiver behind them. There is
               a momentary stand off.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where are my men?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Dead.

                                   CHIN
                         YAAHHH!!

               Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash
               Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the
               rear wall of the elevator. Mamooli jumps Finnegan from
               behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat.
               Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his
               face. Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar
               plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at
               Mamooli's throat in a flash. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian. Impressed. She had no idea.

                                   HANOVER
                         Drop it!

               Finnegan looks up into the barrel of Hanover's gun...and a
               pair of eyes that will use it. Finnegan does as he is told.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Now, back up!

               Again, Finnegan does as he is told.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Everybody in!

               The Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply. As they
               slip in, Trillian tries to slip out. Hanover swings his gun
               on her.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Where are you going?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (freezing)
                         Nowhere...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Hanover, listen...

                                   HANOVER
                         Shut up!

               Hanover hit the elevator button. The elevator starts to rise.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Now, where's Mulligan? Where's
                         Vivo?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I told you...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Man, there's something here! On the
                         boat!

                                   CANTON
                         You see? You see?

                                   HANOVER
                         Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now
                         here's what we're doing... Mamooli
                         is going to take you back to fix
                         your engines, Chin and I are
                         staying here to finish the job...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Did you clear this?

                                   HANOVER
                         With who?

               All of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some
               giant hand was yanking on the cable.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         With that...

               And then, the elevator jerks down again. And up. Everyone is
               thrown about like straw. Everyone is shouting, panicked.
               And then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking
               surrounds the car. The cable starts twisting, creaking
               sickeningly above their heads.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         It's gonna snap the cable!

               Trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Open! Open! God damn it!!

               Finnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Help me!!

               Pantucci, then Mamooli, then Hanover and Chin pull at the
               doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons. The doors part a
               bit.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         They're coming! They're coming!

               The doors fly open to...a solid wall.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Oh shit...

               And silence...until the doors slam shut...the cable
               snaps...and the car plummets! Screaming and shouting mixes
               with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame
               against the shaft. Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator.

        13     12 -- 11 -- 10 -- 9 -- 8 -- 7 -- 6 -- 5 -- 4!           13

               An AUTOMATED VOICE rapidly CALLS OUT right along with it --

                                   VOICE
                         4th floor. 3rd floor. 2nd floor.
                         1st floor...

               Down, down, down it goes. Faster and faster. But the elevator
               doesn't stop at the first floor. It keeps dropping. The FLOOR
               INDICATOR BLINKS: "SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL."

                                   CANTON
                         It's taking us to the bottom of the
                         ship!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         HANG ON!

               CABLES SNAP. METAL SCREAMS. The ELEVATOR starts to BUCKLE.
               Which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways
               in the shaft which slows it down. The it HITS bottom with a
               resounding crash.

                                                       CUT TO:

        85     SUBLEVEL LOBBY - DAY                                    85

               The DOORS BLOW OUT into the darkened hallway. For a long
               moment nothing moves, then Finnegan tumbles out of the
               elevator. Rising painfully. One after another the others exit
               into the dark lobby.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where are we?

                                   CANTON
                         The sublevel lobby.

               Finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles.

                                   HANOVER
                         Don't touch it!

               Finnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily, his own
               rifle trained on Finnegan.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You shoot me and you got no ride
                         home...

               And with that, Finnegan picks up the gun. A test of wills.
               Finnegan wins, and then turns to the Captain.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         You the Captain?

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Yes.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         How do we get out of here?

                                   CAPTAIN
                         We have to make it to the third
                         deck...

               Pantucci steps on something. CRUNCH! He looks down, his eyes
               widen.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Oh no!! Oh no!! Finnegan!!!

               He starts dancing around, trying not to step on whatever it
               is. Trillian looks down and SCREAMS. 

               Everybody freaks -- 

               Finnegan grabs a flashlight from Chin's utility belt, and
               sweeps the beam over the lobby. The entire floor of the lobby
               is littered with shattered HUMAN SKELETONS. Picked clean and
               spit out. Just like the earlier whale bones. 

               Then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the
               metal WALLS suddenly EXPANDS and FLEXES. Everybody feezes.
               And then the FLEXING suddenly comes RACING down either side
               of the hallway, accompanied by the most god-awful PRIMORDIAL
               SCREECH!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         This way!

               FINNEGAN BOLTS. Everybody else right behind him. The FLEXING
               and SCREECHING VANISHES into the walls.

                                                       CUT TO:

        86     FUJI MARY & SAIPAN - DAY                                86

               RAIN POURS DOWN on the Fuji Maru and the Saipan as they bob
               in the waves, surrounded by endless choppy ocean waters.

                                                       CUT TO:

        87     SAIPAN ENGINE ROOM - DAY                                87

               Billy comes down the steps, gun out front, looking around.

                                   BILLY
                         Hey you! Muscles! Out here!

               There is no reply. The only sound is the sucking of the pump.

                                   BILLY (CONT'D)
                         O.K. You want it that way... 

               He ENTERS the waist-high water.

                                   BILLY (CONT'D)
                         ...when I find you, you pay...

               Billy heads deeper into the hold.

                                                       CUT TO:

        88     MACHINE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER                            88

               Damp, dark and disgusting. A MAZE of pipes and gears lines
               the walls. Finnegan SLAMS the HATCH shut. Dogs it tight.
               Everyone's gathering themselves around the room: Trillian,
               Pantucci, Hanover, Mamooli, Chin, the Captain and Canton.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         We've gotta call for help.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Yeah man, no shit, call in the
                         Marines.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         We can't...all the communication
                         systems went down.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         So get them back up.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         I don't know how.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Hey I can fix any damn thing...
                         where's the comm. center?

                                   CANTON
                         We should get off as soon as
                         possible.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         But if we can at least send a
                         message...

                                   CANTON
                         I say we evacuate as soon as...

                                   FINNEGAN
                             (to Canton)
                         Who are you?

                                   CAPTAIN
                         He's the owner...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Why don't you want a message sent?

                                   CANTON
                         I just think that...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Because you know a message can't be
                         sent...

               There is a moment of silence.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         You're the inside guy aren't you?
                         The guy who knocked out the
                         communications.

               Hanover sets Mason's pulse-rifle down and claps his hands.

                                   HANOVER
                         Bravo.

               Canton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused.
               Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS
               him against the hull.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How the hell do we fix it?!

               A tense moment as Canton debates his situation, then relents.

                                   CANTON
                         You can't... All the systems were
                         melted at their core by nitric
                         acid...

                                   CAPTAIN
                             (confused)
                         This was your life's work...your
                         dreams...

                                   CANTON
                         My dreams cost more than they would
                         make...I miscalculated the
                         market... there was no way I could
                         recoup...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Unless you collected on the
                         insurance...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What are you people talking about?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         He's with them. 

               He motions to the mercenaries.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         They rob the joint blind and
                         torpedo it to the bottom. He
                         collects the insurance, and sails
                         off into the sunset clean as a
                         whistle.

               Finnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Right?

               The Captain blows. He leaps on Canton. His hands find the
               older man's throat.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         All these people dead!! Because you
                         screwed up on the math?? 

               Finnegan pulls the Captain off.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         It's not going to help us!

                                   CAPTAIN
                         We're going to die here! We're
                         going to die!

               Finnegan holds the Captain with both hands, calming him.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I was born in a City housing
                         project in the Bronx OK? It's not
                         in the cards that I die on a luxury
                         cruise ship...now which way up?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (alarmed)
                         You hear that?

               Unseen by anyone, there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY. The
               walls start to come alive with dark, SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS.
               HIDDEN within the maze of machinery, OBSCURED by the bad
               lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm
               through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes.
               The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         They are...they are everywhere.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         All right, be cool, everybody, nice
                         and slow, no sudden moves.

               Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. Then a
               loud GURGLING is HEARD. Everybody looks up at the ceiling. 

               Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large
               translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside
               it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING
               suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and
               LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty
               intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly. EVERYBODY
               freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch. Finnegan and Hanover
               OPEN FIRE. Covering their asses.

                                                       CUT TO:

        89     ENGINE CHAMBERS - NIGHT                                 89

               Everybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into
               this mechanical MAZE. The engine chambers are a labyrinth of
               pipe-lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks
               and pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark.

               Hanover, Pantucci, Chin and Mamooli OPEN UP. FIRING blindly
               and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in
               the darkness. The MUZZLE FLASHES and TRACER FIRE light up the
               chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau. We catch more
               ABSTRACT GLIMPSES of the translucent TENTACLE-SACS, strange
               FEELERS, groping SUCKERS, SLIME and VEINS.

                                                       CUT TO:

        90     DEEP IN MAZE - NIGHT                                    90

               Finnegan rounds a corner and crouch-runs down a narrow alley.
               Alone now. White-knuckling his rifle. He turns another corner
               and runs right into Trillian.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         AHHH!!

               ...Spins, gun ready to fire at...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Noooo!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Jesus Christ lady...

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (scared)
                         What are those things?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't know...

               Finnegan looks around to the engine room, a labyrinth of pipe
               lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and
               pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark. He
               takes off.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         ...there's got to be a way to
                         access out back there... 

               He motions into the deep shadows.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         But what makes you think there
                         aren't more of hose...things...back
                         there?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Nothing...you want to come, come...
                         you don't...

               Trillian weighs her options, and takes off after Finnegan.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You don't have to be so touchy.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Look lady, I know you people are
                         used to getting your way...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What's that supposed to mean? You
                         people.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You people...rich people...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I'm not rich people.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Well, you sure do a good imitation.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Thank you, I work at it...

               Finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk. He
               starts to climb. Trillian, hampered by her long slinky dress,
               rips at the bottom, making it maxi to mini in a flash, and
               scoots after Finnegan.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         I heard you say you grew up in the
                         projects in the Bronx...

               Reaching the top of the ladder, she clambers onto the catwalk
               next to Finnegan, who is deciding which way to go.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Trillian Daley... 

               She holds out her hand.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Projects...South Chicago. 

               Finnegan ignores her hand.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Finnegan...John J...now that we've
                         been properly introduced, can we
                         get the hell out of here?

               Finnegan starts to walk down the catwalk.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         So this boat of yours...that's what
                         you do? Give people...rides.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         That's what I do.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Seen a lot of islands?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Quite a few.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Since I'm a kid, I had this
                         dream... I want to own my own
                         tropical island...
                         Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food,
                         little clothes...population of
                         one...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Anti social?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Self sufficient...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         With the emphasis on SELF, and in
                         selfish, right?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Takes one to know one.

               SNAP!! A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian.
               Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. 

               Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed.
               Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt.
               Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- 

               The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach.
               Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place.
               Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees
               -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up
               and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling
               their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to
               Finnegan. 

               Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's
               feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen
               in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her.
               Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall.
               FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES
               against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. 

               A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He
               leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle,
               turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to
               run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap
               onto his arm. HE YELLS. 

               The Creature starts reeling him in. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She
               stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. 

               ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being
               reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle.
               When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running
               back. Panting hard, she aims the gun.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Shoot it! Shoot it!

               Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the
               tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         The safety! The safety!

               Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right
               lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to
               find it.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I don't know where it is!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         On the side!!

               Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best
               thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS
               the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink
               blood, releases Finnegan and recoils.

               Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The
               tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again.
               Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to
               his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle
               coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan
               grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and
               fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Let's get the hell out of here!

               Finnegan staggers to his feet. He and Trillian run off.

                                                       CUT TO:

        91     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     91

               Trillian and Finnegan come running around a corner, and stop
               to catch their breath.

                                   FINNEGAN
                             (annoyed)
                         The safety...the safety... He
                         flicks the safety on and off.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Got it?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (pissed)
                         Hey! I didn't have to come back.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Yeah you did...

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (defensive)
                         Right... You have a boat.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Boat or no boat... You woulda come
                         back anyway. You're that kind of
                         gal.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Oh yeah? What kind is that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The "come back" kind.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How do you know that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Takes one to know one.

               Finnegan's small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable.

                                   V.O.
                         HEELLPP!!

                                                       CUT TO:

        92     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     92

               The Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web.
               Struggling, frantic. But the more he struggles, the more
               enmeshed he gets. He holds his hands out beseechingly to
               Canton, who stands looking at him in terror.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Help me!

               But Canton does not move. All of a sudden Canton sees
               something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes
               his blood freeze.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What is it?

               Canton takes a few steps back.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What?!... WHAT?!

               The Captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it
               is. There is a DARK MOVEMENT deep within the spider web.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         HELP ME, CANTON! HELP MEEEEEEE!!

               ANGLE ON: Finnegan and Trillian racing across a catwalk.
               Below them, they can see Canton backing away from the
               Captain.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Grab his hands!!

               Canton looks up, stunned, as he sees Finnegan and Trillian
               rushing down from the catwalk.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         CANTON!! HELP!!

               Canton backs away from the Captain, as the Captain's struggle
               draws him further into the web. The Captain's eyes bulge,
               horrified, as he feels SOMETHING inside the spider web GRAB
               him from behind.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         IT HURTS!!!!! IT
                         HURRRRRTTTTTSSSS!!!

               He struggles WILDLY. Then starts to freeze up as the
               tentacles wrap around him. 

               Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is
               slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body
               bady constricting, paralyzed. His VOICE is CHOKED OFF.

               Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another
               alleyway. Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his
               FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web. They skid to a stop.
               Everybody piles up. Eyes wide. Watching as the Captain's body
               is pulled deeper into the dark web. Tentacles enveloping him.

                                   HANOVER
                             (to Canton)
                         Where is the closest hatch?

               Canton still pressed against the wall, staring at the spot
               the Captain disappeared, talking to himself.

                                   CANTON
                         I never meant for anyone to get
                         hurt ...it was supposed to be
                         clean...

               Hanover grabs Canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo
               jacket.

                                   HANOVER
                         You hypocritical bastard...all you
                         gave a shit about was the money...
                         where's the hatch!!

               Canton points down a darkened passageway.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Alright let's move out...you two on
                         point...

               He looks at an uneasy Mamooli and Chin.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey... Which way's aft?

                                   PANTUCCI
                         That way.

               He points in the opposite direction.

                                   HANOVER
                         Who gives a shit about aft?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         That's where my boat's moored.

                                   HANOVER
                         You trying to take over my show
                         Finnegan, that what you trying to
                         do?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Just trying to get to my boat...

               Finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction
               that disappears in the dark. Pantucci is right with him.
               Trillian, a step behind.

                                   HANOVER
                             (yelling)
                         You stay away from that vault! You
                         hear me?

               Just before he steps into the darkness, Finnegan calls over
               his shoulder...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         They respond to sound...

               He disappears into the dark. Canton looks at Hanover for a
               long moment, and then takes off after Finnegan. The other two
               mercs look at Hanover, wavering.

                                   HANOVER
                             (tense)
                         What?

               The sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around
               nervously.

                                   MAMOOLI
                             (whispered)
                         He made sense.

                                   HANOVER
                             (loud)
                         He's a bloody...

               And then conscious of his voice reverberating...

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                             (whispered)
                         ...he's a bloody taxi driver!

               Chin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after Finnegan. Hanover
               stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming. After a long
               moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well.

                                                       CUT TO:

        93     BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY                                93

               In SLOW-MO, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened,
               pipe-lined passageway. Guns out front. Sight beams sweeping
               the path ahead. Eyes wide open. Sweat sliding down their
               faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding
               out of chests. 

               The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension. 

               Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking
               reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan
               continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes
               nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air. 

               LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian
               and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark
               foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They
               come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan
               turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head.
               He has none.

                                   HANOVER
                             (whispered)
                         Very good Finnegan...very good.

               Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and
               pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat
               mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times,
               and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan
               looks at her curiously, but with respect.

                                                       CUT TO:

        94     BALLAST SECTION - DAY                                   94

               They ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are
               indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND.
               Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some
               STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single
               violently twisted HATCH DOOR. 

               Finnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give. 

               Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle
               to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton,
               who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well
               at all.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         What's on the far side?

                                   CANTON
                         I don't know.

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (nerves)
                         It's your damn ship! What the hell
                         do you mean you don't know?

               Finnegan touches Pantucci's shoulder.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey, what difference does it
                         make...

               Finnegan enters the water.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         If you hear one shot, you know I
                         made it...start coming...

               Pantucci follows Finnegan to the water.

                                   HANOVER
                         How do we know you're going to
                         signal...how do we know you're not
                         going to just take off? 

               Finnegan stops.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'll wait here... You go check it
                         out.

               Hanover does not move.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                             (contemptuous)
                         I didn't think so.

               Finnegan wades into the water. Just before he sinks beneath
               the surface...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Finnegan...

               He looks back.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Be careful.

               With a smile, Finnegan dives under. Pantucci right behind
               him. The others stand looking around, nervous.

                                                       CUT TO:

        95     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                      95

               Finnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast. Then into a
               passageway lined with black pipes. Pantucci right behind him.
               STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters. 

               CREAKS and MOANS. Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they
               swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts.
               The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift
               up from the darkness below. 

               The MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind.
               He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM!
               AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers
               on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. He fights his way
               past and swims off in a panic.

                                                       CUT TO:

        96     BALLAST - NIGHT                                         96

               Trillian stares down into the water. Hanover keeps a sharp,
               nervous eye back down the catwalk, white-knuckling his pulse
               rifle. Chin and Mamooli keep watch, tight lipped. Canton
               paces back and forth, driven by anxiety.

                                   HANOVER
                         Stop pacing.

               Canton acts as if he does not hear. He keeps pacing. Hanover
               chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into Canton's arm.
               Canton crumbles against the railing, in pain.

                                   CANTON
                         AAAAHHHH!!!!

                                   HANOVER
                         You deaf?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Why don't you back off?

                                   HANOVER
                         You want some too?

               Hanover's jaw clenches. He releases the safety on his rifle,
               the click resounding ominously in the hollow room.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How brave we are.

               Trillian's eyes fix on Hanover's, unwavering. A Mexican
               standoff.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         Hanover!

               Everyone turn to... A giant ball of black, wet, OOZING RUBBER
               UNDULATES down the gangway. Coming straight at them. A mass
               of glistening striated MUSCLE.

                                   HANOVER
                         Fire!!

               The three men open up with their pulse rifles. The CREATURE
               gets RIPPED TO SHREDS. Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS
               everywhere. But onward it comes. Down the gangway. 

               Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens
               fire. Canton jumps into the water and disappears.

                                                       CUT TO:

        97     KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         97

               Finnegan explodes to the surface. GASPING for air. He reaches
               down and yanks a half drowned Pantucci up next to him. They
               both look up to gunfire exploding in the distance.

                                                       CUT TO:

        98     BALLAST ROOM - NIGHT                                    98

               The creature keeps coming. The mercs keep firing. Then
               without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the
               water, disappearing beneath the surface. 

               Trillian is astounded. She throws down her pistol, picks up
               the pulse rifle, and slams on the trigger. The recoil of the
               rifle throws her into the water. When she surfaces, she sees
               Chin and Mamooli, firing as they retreat to the water's edge.
               Still holding her rifle, she dives.

                                                       CUT TO:

        99     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                      99

               Trillian swims down a violently SHAKING PASSAGEWAY. Eyes
               wide. Filled with fear. All around, DEBRIS DROPS through the
               water. Primordial SOUNDS REVERBERATE off the walls. Lots of
               BUBBLING and GURGLING -- THEN SOMETHING LUNGES OUT! 

               TRILLIAN OPENS UP. FIRING wildly. The water fills with FIRE
               and BUBBLES. Trillian looks around. Scared shitless. The
               bubbles clear just in time for her to see -- Chin, mouth
               open, eyes wide, screaming in agony, being ripped past her.
               She tries to fire her rifle. Too late. Trillian watches as
               Chin VANISHES down the shaft in a CLOUD OF BUBBLES.

                                                       CUT TO:

               TRILLIAN BURSTS to the surface. FINNEGAN YANKS her up and out
               of the water.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You O.K.?

               Trillian can only nod, and gasp for breath. Canton and
               Hanover catch their breath, PANTING AWAY, waterlogged.
               Hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in Trillian's
               hand. Trillian points the barrel at him, and hits the safety.

               Mamooli bursts out of the water, falling on the floor, close
               to panic mode.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         Where's Chin?

                         This is not real! This is not
                         bloody real!

               Finnegan TOPPLES a large, heavy metal BROILER onto the open
               floor gate, sealing the watery hole in the floor. There are
               two hatches in this room. The far hatch is closed. Mamooli
               stands next to an OPEN HATCH. Canton points to it.

                         There's stairways...

               Mamooli SLAMS the HATCH SHUT. Eyes bugging out of his head.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         I say we stay right here!

                         hold out...someone'll rescue us...

                         Who?

                         Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!

                         zapped the communications.

                         Boat or no boat...I'm going...

               Finnegan steps forward. Mamooli aims his rifle right at
               Finnegan's head.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         They're wipin' us out one at a

                             (calm)
                         Nobody's shooting nobody...come on,
                         just let us through the hatch!

                                   MAMOOLI
                         I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill
                         you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm
                         not playin' around here!

               Finnegan freezes. CLOSE ON: The hatch. As a BLACK LIQUID
               starts to OOZE through a tiny latch-hole. No one sees it.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I once saw a guy put a fish in a
                         bottle, then he corked it, sealing
                         it tight, and threw it to a baby
                         octopus. The little sucker felt its
                         way around that bottle, and in less
                         than two minutes, got that cork
                         off, slid inside, and ate that
                         fish.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         What the hell are you talking
                         about?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Us...I'm talking about us... We're
                         the fish.

               The LIQUID SHADOW OOZES down and hits the floor, starts to
               EXPAND, filling like a water balloon. It's not a liquid. It's
               a Tentacle. VEINS, FEELERS and SUCKERS begin to form.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         And what? These things are
                         octopuses

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't know what these things are
                         ...all I know is...

               The TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli. Inches
               behind his head. Finnegan and Hanover see it. Eyes widening.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         What...? What??

               Mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to
               strike.

                                   MAMOOLI (CONT'D)
                         EEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH!!!!

               He opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The
               tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The
               room is empty. He runs out.

                                                       CUT TO:

       101     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     101

               Mamooli rushes into the empty passageway, looks left. Then
               right. His POV. Down the hall another TENTACLE comes racing
               at him. Mamooli panics, drops his rifle. 

               TRACK WITH Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his
               shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after
               him...gaining...gaining... almost on him... Mamooli leaps
               through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift
               motion. The tentacle slams into the glass portal. Stopped.
               Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps.
               He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns... WHAM!!!
               Another tentacle envelops his face!

                                   MAMOOLI
                         EEEYYYAAAHHHH!!!!!

                                                       CUT TO:

       102     MECHANICAL CHAMBER - NIGHT                             102

               Dante's Inferno: STEAM, SMOKE, FIRE, STRANGE NOISES, DARK
               AREAS, and lots of MOVING ENGINE PARTS. 

               Finnegan leads, followed by Trillian, Hanover, Pantucci, and
               Canton. We can HEAR their HEARTS BEATING. Scary shit.
               Finnegan heads for a open HATCH. It suddenly SLAMS SHUT. He
               instantly VEERS down another passageway.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What the hell is going on!!

               Finnegan heads for another open HATCHWAY. It also SLAMS SHUT.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         They're herding us. 

               Finnegan and company keep going.

                                   HANOVER
                         What are you talking about?

               As they round a corner, the CEILING IMPLODES right in front
               of them. PIPES and OTHER MATTER CRASH down. Cutting them off.
               Leaving only one route open...a slim passageway.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Like cattle...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You're saying they can think?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'm saying they're calling the
                         shots...

               Finnegan heads toward the passageway.

                                   CANTON
                         Do we have to go there?

               The ceiling left above them begins to torque, and splits. The
               answer is plain. Everyone runs into the passage just as the
               ceiling comes down.

                                                       CUT TO:

       103     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     103

               Finnegan leads them single-file, they quickly head into a
               SHAKING narrow void. Fear has led to silence, and unbearable
               tension. The walls on either side creak, and moan with
               strange noises.

                                                       CUT TO:

       104     MID-HULL - NIGHT                                       104

               Finnegan quickly comes out of the CREAKING, MOANING GANGWAY,
               followed by the others. All the STRANGE NOISES suddenly STOP.
               Everything gets quiet. Finnegan freezes. Something's wrong.
               Everybody looks around. STEAM SHOOTS OUT from multiple pipes.
               The air is thick with MIST.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What's the matter?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The quiet...

                                   HANOVER
                         Maybe we lost them.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Or maybe we're exactly where they
                         want us to be.

               Finnegan moves on. The others follow. Guns out front. TENSE.
               They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a
               soul-wrenching nightmare. The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH.

               Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge
               GELATINOUS WOMB. Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow
               JELL-O, with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it.
               If it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered
               beautiful. Inside the womb, A DOZEN HUMANS, passengers, float
               around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living
               dead. They all seem to be breathing the gelatin. Several
               TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re
               forms in some sort of strange mitosis. 

               Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified.
               But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at
               them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as
               their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. Trillian looks
               sick, trembles in fear.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What is it?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         A meat locker.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         We can't just leave them here.

               Canton looks like he's about to throw up, he starts backing
               away, heading for a side hatch.

                                   CANTON
                         I can.

               In the womb, a Tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young
               LADY. The Lady tries to back-pedal away, but because of the
               gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only
               move in slow motion. The FEELERS GRIP her naked thigh. She
               tries to scream, but her face is already starting to
               constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed. Pantucci is so
               horrified he's about to cry.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Oh no...oh God please no.

               The TENTACLE-SAC gloms onto the Lady's forehead. THROUGH THE
               SAC we can SEE her SKIN MELTING. The only thing she can move
               are her EYES, which are bugging-out in absolute horror as she
               is imbibed alive. Our heroes are frozen in fear. Until the
               Lady's EYES LIQUEFY. 

               Trillian burries her head in Finnegan's shoulder, trying to
               shut out the horror.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         We can't do anything for them...
                         Let's go...

               He begins to lead her toward the hatch...when her eyes
               recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair. The old
               lady seems to see her too. Her hands read out, IMPLORING. Her
               mouth silently shapes the words: HELP ME! Just as a tentacle
               comes creeping toward her.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         NOOO!!

               Her rage rises. She hefts her rifle, and starts blasting
               away.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         You won't get her!! You won't!!

               Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE. The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin.
               BLASTING IT AWAY. But the bullets only manage to go about
               twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop.
               GELATIN EXPLODES all over the place. TRACER HOLES STREAK
               through the stuff. But all the bullets are sliding short.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Finnegan...do something!! Please!!

               Finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling
               where most of the Tentacles are coming from. Their long TAILS
               WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes. A bas-relief of
               horror. Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades
               off Hanover's utility belt.

                                   HANOVER
                         Finnegan, No!!!

               ...bites the pins and spits them out.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Eat this.

               He chucks the grenades up into the strange WRITHING FRESCO,
               safely clear of the passengers.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         FIRE IN THE HOLE!

               Pantucci and Hanover throw themselves to the floor. Finnegan
               pulls Trillian down, covering her.

               BA-WOOM! GELATIN SPRAYS EVERYWHERE.

                                                       CUT TO:

       105     FUJI MARU - SAME TIME                                  105

               A loud, creepy, suction-like SOUND is HEARD, that strange
               pitter- patter of little feet running across the hull. Then
               the HULL begins to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.

                                                       CUT TO:

       106     MID HULL - NIGHT                                       106

               All the MOVEMENT STOPS. The remaining TENTACLES VANISH into
               the machinery. Pantucci, and Hanover look up from the floor,
               covered in slime. Finnegan and Trillian also look up...and
               then look at each other face to face...inches apart. Dripping
               with slime.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Looking good...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You should talk...

               Then the machinery shuts down. The engines go dead. ALL SOUND
               CUTS OUT. An expectant hush. Somewhere, WATER DRIPS... 

               WE GO EXTREMELY CLOSE ON Trillian's EYES. Pantucci's EYES.
               Hanover's EYES. Finnegan's EYES. The air is riddled with
               ominous expectation. And that's when the HULL BEGINS TO
               TORQUE. RIVETS POP and SNAP. WATER SPRAYS. METAL BUCKLES.

       107     SHOT:                                                  107

               At the far end of the ship, part of the LOWER BOW RIPS OPEN!
               AND A WALL OF WATER RUSHES IN. FLOOD CITY! Finnegan's eyes
               widen as he sees (MODEL SHOT) the massive WAVE OF WATER
               CRASHING TOWARDS THEM. RIPPING OUT PIPES, DUCTS, WALLS,
               EQUIPMENT and EVERYTHING in front of it.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         GO! GO! GO!

               They all hightail it for hatches. Finnegan and Trillian make
               it into one hatch. Hanover and Pantucci make it into another.
               WATER CRASHES and SPRAYS behind them.

                                                       CUT TO:

       108     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      108

               Massive AIR BUBBLES EXPLODE out from under the bow.

                                                       CUT TO:

       109     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      109

               RED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH up and down every passageway. And a
               CLAXTON RINGS, in accelerating tones, giving a frenetic
               urgency to ALL OF THE

                                                   FOLLOWING SCENES:

       110     A PASSAGEWAY:                                          110

               WATER BLASTS through a hatch and CHASES Finnegan and Trillian
               down a passageway. They jag left at an intersection -- WATER
               BLASTS through the hatch directly in front of them.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         We're going to sink! We've got to
                         get on deck!

               They backtrack. Trillian's now in the lead. They HAUL ASS
               down a hallway. WATER ROARING IN from everywhere behind them.
               All of the watertight HATCHES begin to hydraulically CLOSE.
               Trillian and Finnegan JAG into a hatch. It's a small room.
               The hatch in front of them closes. WATER BLASTS in behind
               them. SWEEPS them off their feet. The ROOM quickly starts to
               FILL UP. Trillian pulls frantically at the hatch.

                                                       CUT TO:

       111     NARROW PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                              111

               Hanover and Pantucci quickly slog their way through knee-high
               water. Pantucci stumbles into the water, frantically
               scrambles up. He looks back -- UNDER THE WATER, INKY FORMS
               hurl themselves down the passageway right towards him.
               Pantucci YELPS, and splashes away.

                                                       CUT TO:

       112     SUBMERGING ROOM - NIGHT                                112

               Trillian and Finnegan pull with all their might on a tiny
               portal. Finnegan tries to insert the blade of his knife in
               the crack.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         So how do you get from the Bronx to
                         the South China sea?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You quit high school, lie about
                         your age, join the navy, and next
                         thing you know, four years are up
                         and you need a way to make a
                         living...

               The knife blade slips into the crack.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         I'll break the seal! Pull.

               He yanks the blade. Trillian pulls. The seal pops. The portal
               flies open. Waist-high in water, Trillian sticks her arm out,
               tries to get her shoulder out, but there's no chance in hell
               of that.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Too small!

               She pulls her arm out. And a TENTACLE LUNGES IN. Just missing
               Trillian. It SPLASHES under the water. GRABS Finnegan's
               ankle. Pulls him under. FINNEGAN sticks the barrel of his gun
               underwater and OPENS FIRE. WATER EXPLODES. The Tentacle
               recoils. And rips itself back out the porthole. Trillian
               SLAMS the PORTHOLE SHUT and dogs it tight. The

               WATER QUICKLY RISES.

                                                       CUT TO:

               Pantucci and Hanover hauling ass. Hanover pulls out his last
               two Thermite grenades. Pantucci panics and grabs for them.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Gimme one! Gimme one!

               He knocks both of them out of Hanover's hands. They DISAPPEAR
               under the water.

                                   HANOVER
                         You idiot!

               They quickly fumble around in the water, trying to find them.
               A TENTACLE BLASTS around the corner. Partially obscured by
               the wave in front of it. Heading right for them. Hanover
               finds the two grenades. Gives one to Pantucci. They rip the
               pins out and toss the grenades behind them.
               Then HAUL ASS faster. The Tentacle right behind them. A BEAT.
               And then the GRENADES EXPLODE, BA-WOOM! BA-WOOM!

               The storm hammers the deck. Canton staggers out onto the RAIN
               SLICKED DECK just in time to see -- A HOLE BEING BLOWN OUT
               the side of the Fuji Maru's HULL. BUBBLES continue to EXPLODE
               OUT from under the bow.

                                   CANTON
                         Oh my God, it's going to sink.

               Then slowly, Canton gets a gleam in his eye, now thrilled.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         It's going to sink.

               Finnegan and Trillian are getting banged around the frothy
               WATER as it quickly RISES. Now only inches from the ceiling.
               Trapped. They're about to drown. Finnegan keeps looking
               around, trying to figure a way out.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I was so goddamn close, Finnegan!
                         So goddamn close to my island... I
                         could almost taste the sand...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Keep tasting...

               Finnegan shoves the pulse rifle to the ceiling. And blasts
               away until part of the ceiling falls out and into the water.
               There's just enough room between two metal beams to get out.
               The rising WATER SHOVES them up through the hole.

               Side-by-side, Hanover and Pantucci quickly slog their way
               through waist-high water. They round a corner and look back --
               INKY FORMS SLOSH around the corner. Heading right for them.
               They slog faster.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         They're catchin' up! They're
                         catchin' up! We gotta slow 'em
                         down!

                                   HANOVER
                         Feed them. That'll slow them down.

               A black STRIATED MUSCLE ROILS out of the foamy water, then
               quickly VANISHES under it, heading straight for them.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Feed 'em?!! Okay! All right! Feed
                         'em what? WHAT ARE WE GONNA FEED

               'EM?! Hanover takes his pistol and SHOOTS Pantucci in the
               leg, BLAM! Pantucci SCREAMS. FALLS into the water. 

               Hanover RUNS on. 

               Pantucci doesn't even have time to deal with the pain. He
               starts SCRAMBLING through the water. UNDERWATER, the INKY
               FORMS RACE AFTER HIM. Only meters away. Pantucci throws
               himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter. SLAMS the DOOR
               SHUT. The TENTACLE ATTACKS the door. WORMING its way across
               the surface, trying to find a way inside. Pantucci is scared
               beyond his pain. Pushing back as far as he can against the
               rear wall, he sees the control button. He presses the up
               arrow. The dumbwaiter starts to move.

               The Saipan is still bobbing behind the Fuji Maru. But the
               HARPOON HOOK, which holds the tow-line and is embedded into
               the rear deck of the ship, is starting to PRY LOOSE. It JERKS
               and BUCKS against the metal wall. Canton doesn't notice this
               as he slips and slides his way up to the railing. He sees the
               Saipan and smiles. Then he looks off at --

       118     ISLAND                                                 118

               rising out of the ocean. About a mile away. Canton starts to
               climb over the railing. And that's when the HARPOON HOOK RIPS
               FREE. WHIZZES FORWARD. And IMPALES Canton's LEG. He SCREAMS.
               Tries to spin free. The hook hangs onto his leg for a long,
               agonizing BEAT as Canton continues to SCREAM. Then the HOOK
               RIPS FREE, grabs the METAL RAILING and starts TEARING IT off
               the deck. Canton drops to the deck, holding his leg and
               whimpering in pain. And then he sees it --

       119     SPEEDBOAT                                              119

               dangling from its harness down on the watersports platform.

               Canton starts to crawl for it. Moaning and bleeding.

               beneath a colorful NEON SIGN which READS:

               "THE FUJI MARU - YOUR FUN SHIP"

               In the dark, Trillian trips. She falls to the slippery,
               waterlogged deck, and SCREAMS...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         EEEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH!

               face...and the thing that attached itself there...a small
               squid from the shattered aquarium.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)

               Tries to catch her breath.

                         It's OK...it's not one of them...
                         it's from the aquarium...it's...

               And then it dawns on Finnegan.

                         You know what kind of force it took
                         to rip open the bow of this ship? A
                         million little things like this...

               He holds up the squid.

               RED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH. The CLAXTON RINGS. Off to one side
               of a wall, behind the bar, the dumbwaiter door opens, and
               Pantucci tumbles out, looks around, and then hears...

                                   HANOVER (V.O.)
                         Help!! Help!! 

               Pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed
               bandits... rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover.

               Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. His face
               is badly constricted. His body paralyzed. He clings to a
               black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg.
               It's already to his hip. He grasps desperately for his
               pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. This guy ain't
               gonna survive. 

               PANTUCCI YELPS and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally
               tense. He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle,
               and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover. Pantucci
               is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover. Then he
               looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         ...even you don't deserve this.

               Pantucci picks up Hanover's pistol. Then slowly, cautiously,
               he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's
               TWITCHING HAND.

                                   PANTUCCI (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry man...

               He turns and quickly limps off. Hanover's EYES look down at
               the gun in his hand. Then, with all the strength he has left,
               he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his
               head. 

               CLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes
               the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself.
               He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun
               is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream.

               HARPOON HOOK finishes TEARING the railing off the ship. The
               HOOK, the TOW- LINE, and the ENTIRE RAILING DROP over the
               side and fall OUT OF SIGHT. The TWO BOATS are now UNCOUPLED.
               Finnegan reels at the rain soaked sky.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Will somebody give me a break here?

               And that's when Finnegan and Trillian hear the SOUND of a
               HYDRAULIC HOIST. They look over --

       125     AT THE WATERSPORTS PLATFORM:                           125

               The speedboat is being hydraulically lowered into the water.
               Canton sits inside, fiddling with the ignition. ANGLE ON:
               Trillian and Finnegan racing down the spiral stairs leading
               to the watersports platform.

               The boat touches down into the water.

                                   CANTON
                         I'd like to but I have an
                         appointment with my insurance
                         broker!

               He HITS the HOIST-RELEASE BUTTON. The speedboat breaks free.
               Canton HITS the IGNITION. The boat's ENGINE ROARS.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         Life takes the damndest turns,
                         doesn't it?

               He red-lines the THROTTLE. The SPEEDBOAT HAULS ASS away from
               the cruiseliner. Canton steers for the island. Smiling. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian

               IN HER RAGE...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You son of a bitch!!

               She grabs Finnegan's pulse rifle, hefts it to her shoulder...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Look!

               He forces her to look in the distance. Their POV. The island.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do
                         it? How do we get there?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not like him.

               Finnegan points to the water...and an INKY PSEUDOPOD FORM
               racing after the speedboat underwater.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         It's the engine...it can hear the
                         engine...it goes for the loudest
                         sound...

               The Tentacle quickly picks up speed, going faster and faster,
               getting closer and closer, stretching further and further.
               Suddenly, behind them, a METALLIC THRASHING SOUND is HEARD.
               They turn around and look -- The hook, the tow-line, and the
               entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports
               platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis, trying
               to tear free -- The Saipan is still clinging by its
               fingernails to the Fuji Maru! Finnegan races over to a WINCH
               and grabs the winch- line.

               Canton, smiling brightly, peers at the approaching island
               through the speedboat's windscreen. So relieved he sings to
               himself, from the operetta H.M.S. PINAFORE.

                                   CANTON
                         Oh we sail the ocean blue, and our
                         mighty ship's a beauty. We are
                         strong men, yes it's true, and
                         responsive to our duty...

               When...YANK!!...the SPEEDBOAT is GRABBED from below,
               practically exploding as it DISINTEGRATES into TWO PIECES.
               Canton is PROPELLED through the windscreen and onto the hood.

                                                       CUT TO:

       127     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            127

               Finnegan struggles to clip the winch-line onto the tow-line,
               hanging precariously over the edge of the ship, clip in one
               hand, winch-line in the other. The whole METAL MESS is
               BUCKING and TWISTING and SCREECHING. His every joint is being
               ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the
               line before the entire rig tears away into the sea. 

               With one last heroic effort of will and grit, he snaps the
               clip in place just as it all BREAKS LOOSE. One of the JET
               SKIS and the ENTIRE RAILING are RIPPED over the side and fall
               down into the ocean. Finnegan is also YANKED over the side,
               but he manages to hold on by his fingers, dangling
               precariously.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Hit it! Hit it!

               The HOOK and the TOW-LINE drop -- then SNAP TAUGHT as the
               winch-line holds them tight.

               Trillian throws the start lever on the winch. The WINCH KICKS
               ON and starts reeling in the Saipan. Finnegan tries to crawl
               up on the deck, exhausted. Trillian reaches down and pulls
               him the rest of the way up. He half collapses on top of her.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You know, Finnegan, I'm starting to
                         believe what you said about you not
                         being born to die on a luxury
                         liner.

               Despite the grimness of their position, the closeness of
               their bodies is...a turn on...to both of them...and then a
               SCREAM from the sea. They look in the direction of...

               Canton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face
               shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked
               eyes watch a TENTACLE slowly squirm across the hood toward
               him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. Canton backs away
               from it as far as he can.

               Another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up next to him. Canton crawls away
               from that one. Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping
               mucus. Canton's eyes widen, horrified. Then another TENTACLE
               SQUIRMS up. Canton crawls to the center of the hood. And
               another TENTACLE. Canton has nowhere to go. The Tentacles
               close in on him.

                                   CANTON
                         No! No! No!

               All the tentacles rise over him, about to descend.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)

               Finnegan and Trillian race for all they are worth, clamber
               over the side of the Fuji Maru, dropping to the deck of the
               Saipan.

                                                       CUT TO:

       130     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         130

               Finnegan and Trillian slowly clamber through the hold, waist
               deep in water, on edge, eyes wide, watching for any sign of
               trouble. It's quiet in here. Maybe too quiet.

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (quietly)

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Yeah...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         ...the minute you start your

                         isn't it?

               They step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts
               SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST
               OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is
               stunned.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not unless we kill it first.

               Finnegan SMASHES more of the CRATE, it falls apart, REVEALING
               the entire torpedo. He hands her his pulse rifle.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Anything moves, you shoot.

               Finnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile
               head. Trillian looks around nervously.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         There's not much horsepower left in
                         the engines, but there's enough
                         noise...once this baby's set...I'll
                         rev it up...that slimy bastard will
                         come for it like candy...

                         If you blow up your boat, how are
                         we going to get to the island?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Jet ski...there's one left up
                         there.

               The plate comes loose. Revealing a gaggle of wires, and
               parts.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         ...let's see, it was red wire cross
                         compressor blue wire...or blue
                         cross red?

               He starts to fiddle with the wires. -- Suddenly, there's a
               LOUD SLOSHING SOUND right behind them! CRATES TOPPLE! More
               pulse rifles spill out. Trillian spins, ready to blast away
               with the pulse rifle, to...

                         things?

               Finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Don't forget the safety.

               She hits the safety, slams a shell into chamber...

                         thing livens up a boring evening.

               Finnegan attaches a wire to a sprocket. A red light starts to
               blink on the warhead.

               It is VERY DARK. The RAIN is getting worse. THUNDER RUMBLES.
               LIGHTNING FLASHES. The FUJI MARU MOANS and CREAKS.
               BUBBLES EXPLODE from beneath it. The Saipan rocks against her
               hull. Trillian clambers along the TILTING RAILING, heading

               OK... The ship's METAL HULL SCREECHES. The SEAWATER BUBBLES
               and GURGLES. From somewhere deep inside the ship, we HEAR
               that loud primordial YOWL again. Trillian freezes, her heart
               double beats. She looks around, really scared.

               The missile is on a hoist being pushed forward by Pantucci
               and Finnegan toward a GAPING HOLE in the PORT BOW.

               The TIP of the WARHEAD creeps out through the hole. The body
               of the missile is just a hair too wide, which is good,
               because it jams itself nice and tight into the hole.

               swivel arm that holds it out over the railing. The PLATFORM
               TILTS! Trillian loses her balance. Almost goes over the side.
               Just barely manages to catch herself. Hangs there for a
               moment. Something SWISHES in the water below her. Trillian's
               EYES scan the darkness; scared sick.

               Trillian's scream tears through the night. Finnegan's eyes go
               to the Fuji Maru. He kicks open a box by the side of the
               console, and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol
               handle in a holster.

               Trillian is being dragged down the dark hallway by a tentacle
               wrapped around her legs. She struggles frantically, trying to
               get a clear shot off. But her shot goes wild as she is pulled

               start squirming their way towards her. Trillian feels the
               GELATIN start to MOVE. She struggles wildly. 

               Panicked. Finnegan ENTERS the room. Spots Trillian. Starts
               sloshing his way through the water. Trillian sees him coming.

               quickly closing in on her. Now fifteen feet away.

               As she struggles, Finnegan pulls out his knife, and starts to

               behind her.

                         Grab my hands!!

               Finnegan plunges his hands into the goo. Trillian latches
               onto Finnegan's wrists, he onto hers. Four feet.

                         Push!! Push!!

               Finnegan strains, pulling, until every muscle in his body
               keens with the effort, every vein pops to the surface.
               Trillian pushes for all she is worth. Three feet...two
               feet...one foot...

                                   BOTH

               comes tearing out of the webbing...the remnants of her gown
               doesn't...in the nick of time. 

               The tentacle rushes forward. Finnegan jams his pulse-rifle
               into the web and OPENS FIRE. Blasting the entire clip into
               the goo. Tearing the shit out of it. BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!!! 

               And that's when the whole ROOM starts to QUAKE. And SHAKE!

               hear the LOWER DECKS EXPLODING UPWARD, one at a time -- BAM! 
               - BAM! -- BAM! Something is rising up through the ship. He
               grabs Trillain and pulls her toward the exit. She scoops her
               fallen pulse rifle off the floor.

               Trillian stands there, pulling on the door, half naked. The

               Finnegan turns as the DANCE FLOOR and the D.J. BOOTH EXPLODE
               as SOMETHING RISES UP from below them. His eyes widen. And
               there it is -- The huge, horrible, mutated, mucus-covered,
               sucker-faced HEAD OF THE CREATURE. 

               A giant mutated protoplasm. Jutting up from a breach in the
               floor. The trunk of the Creature, the part where all the
               Tentacles come from, is below the next deck. A slimy,
               translucent MEMBRANE slowly RISES, REVEALING what appears to
               be some sort of ORGANIC LIQUID EYE. It seems to stare right
               at Finnegan, who is transfixed by the sight. A Tentacle
               slowly starts to move in on Finnegan. 

               Finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris
               that blocks his shot. The EYEBALL-type organism follows him.
               Another Tentacle starts to move. Silently undulating through
               the water towards Finnegan. The membrane over the EYE moves.
               And another Tentacle starts to close in for the kill. They
               are surrounding Finnegan. Finnegan comes around the shattered
               D.J. booth. Faces the Creature full-on. He can't miss. He
               gives it a wicked smile.

                         Get a good look...

               In SLOW-MOTION, Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle. It DRIPS
               WATER. He jams the gun-butt into his hip. Takes aim -- FIRES!
               But he only gets off one quick BURST before a TENTACLE LASHES
               OUT and GRABS him. JERKS him into the air. His pulse-rifle
               goes flying. Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into
               the floor, and the death that awaits him.
               He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer,
               closer. He is about to disappear down the hole of no return,
               when his hand comes up with his knife. He slashes the
               tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. As
               he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him.
               Huge. Blocking his way. It's maw opens wide. A terrifying
               sight of jaws and teeth and death. About to devour him. As it
               strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the
               vile thing to smithereens. He bolts through the door, several
               Tentacles already after him.

                                                       CUT TO:

       147     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     147

               Finnegan runs wildly down a passageway. He rounds a corner. A
               TENTACLE SIDE-SWIPES him. Hard. SMASHES him into a wall.
               Finnegan DROPS the shotgun. Hits the floor running. Another
               TENTACLES CHECKS him. Sends him SPIRALING through a hatch. 

               Finnegan TUMBLES in. Face-first. Quickly rolls over and looks
               back -- A TENTACLE LASHES in through the doorway. Finnegan
               back-pedals on his hands and feet, stumbling over various
               sports equipment. The TENTACLE homes-in on him. CHARGES
               FORWARD. Finnegan hurls himself backwards. THROWING anything
               that comes to hand at the Tentacle. A VOLLEYBALL. A WATERSKI.
               A TACKLE BOX. A FRISBEE. But onward it comes. Finnegan back
               pedals faster. Over diving gear. Scuba tanks. Fins and masks. 

               The TENTACLE RISES. About to STRIKE. 

               Finnegan backs into the wall. Trapped. He spots a SPEARGUN.
               Grabs it. 

               The TENTACLE LUNGES. Finnegan FIRES. NAILS IT. PINS IT to the
               wall. Finnegan scrambles past the furiously WRITHING TENTACLE
               and runs out of the room.

                                                       CUT TO:

       148     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            148

               Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into
               the dark water. She frantically whispers to herself:

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Oh my God, oh my God.

               Suddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, SOMETHING SWIRLS
               through the water. Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it. Eyes
               wide. Knuckles white. Breathing hard. WHAMM!! Something drops
               onto the ski behind her.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         EEEEYYYYAAAHHH!!!!

               She turns, ghost white...to Finnegan.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't mean to drop in unannounced
                         ...you ready...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Soon as I get over the heart
                         attack...

               Finnegan whistles. Waits. No engine goes on. He whistles
               again. Still no response. Removes his watch, gives it to
               Trillian.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Three minutes...I'm not back...no
                         matter what...you go...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         No...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You don't take orders very well, do
                         you?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I don't take orders at all.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         This time, make an exception.

               He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of
               the Saipan, and scales up to the deck. Trillian watches him,
               and then looks at the watch.

                                                       CUT TO:

       149     SAIPAN PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                             149

               Finnegan bursts in.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Pantucci!... JOEY!

               Then he spots something on the floor. He reaches down and
               picks it up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's been
               RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares at it. His grip tightening.
               Tears rising in his eyes. His jaw clenching. Then he flings
               the belt aside. Filled with rage.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Time to die, motherfucker.

               Finnegan hits the ignition button. A desperate moment of dry
               cranking ...and then the one remaining engine catches,
               sputters, and fires to life.

                                                       CUT TO:

       150     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      150

               Trillian hears the Saipan's engine come to life. She hits the
               ignition on the jet ski. Right next to her something drops
               from the deck of the Saipan into the water. Finnegan clambers
               up in front of her. His pulse rifle still in hand.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Where's you friend?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         He's not coming...

               The Saipan strains on its leashes. ENGINES GUNNING. Finnegan
               swings his rifle around. OPENS UP on the tie-lines. All the
               TIE-LINES SHRED. The Saipan starts to break free.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Hold on!

               He GUNS the ski...and it stalls. The jet ski stalls. Goes
               dead in the water.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Oh shit!!

               Nearby, the WATER SWIRLS violently. He hammers the starter
               button.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Come on!!

               The ENGINE STUTTERS. He tries again.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Come on!!

               Another STUTTER. More WATER SWIRLS, getting closer now. But
               the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and
               shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle
               comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it,
               blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN
               LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks
               force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle.

       151     FAST:                                                  151

               Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal
               to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for
               dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski.
               Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS.
               The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the
               MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the
               Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE
               EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski.
               Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways
               across the water.

               BOUNCING HARD.

               Trillian can't hold on. Flips off the back. Skips across the
               water. Finnegan ROARS away. A tentacle hard on his ass.
               Trillian pops to the surface. Treads water. Panicked. Watches
               Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. Finnegan looks
               back at Trillian. Bobbing in the water. The he looks at the
               Saipan. Continuing its arc. Its deadly payload racing for the
               Fuji Maru. Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS. SMASHES through a
               wave and heads for Trillian. Trillian sees him and swims
               hard. The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru. The warhead
               perfectly positioned to strike its hull. Only fifty meters
               away. Now forty. Now thirty-five.

       152     FASTER:                                                152

               Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski. Slides up next to
               Trillian. Grabs her by her arm. Rips her out of the water.
               Throws her onto the back of the jet ski. Just as a tentacles
               rises up, lashing out. He GUNS IT. SMASHES through the waves.
               The WARHEAD SPLASHES through the water. The jet ski hauls
               ass.

               ENGINES WHINING OUT.

               Faster and faster. A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER EXPLODES in front
               of the jet ski. A tentacle slaps down hard. Finnegan cuts
               hard. Too late. The JET SKI RAMPS through the geyser.
               They and the JET SKI TUMBLE and SPLASH across the water. The
               SAIPAN CHARGES FORWARD. 

               Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty
               meters away. Now fifteen.

               Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find
               Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles
               converging on him from the murky depths. The "retrieve"
               feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards
               where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the
               surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet
               ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging
               Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides. 

               The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed
               whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The
               WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away
               from hitting the Fuji Maru.

               Now nine meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five.

       153     GO INTO SLO-MO NOW AS:                                 153

               Finnegan paddles hard. Sucking in as much water as he is air.
               A TENTACLE RISES UP out of the water. Looms above Finnegan
               and Trillian. Dripping water. About to strike. There's
               nowhere to hide. Finnegan paddles harder.

       154     COME OUT OF SLOW-MO AS:                                154

               The TENTACLE starts its DOWNWARD LUNGE. And that's when the
               SAIPAN RAMS the Fuji Maru. The WARHEAD SLAMS into its hull.

               BA-WHOOOOOOMMM!!

               The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.

               METAL FLIES.

               WATER SPRAYS.

               FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru
               CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan
               drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another
               EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea.
               Sends shock waves across the water. 

               Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island.
               Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU
               SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface.
               A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and
               STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the
               water.

                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

       155     BEACH - SUNRISE                                        155

               Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the
               beach of the island. 

               They collapse next to each other. Finnegan is exhausted.
               Trillian coughs up seawater. They both turn and look out to
               sea, and the rising sun. Trillian reaches into her bra, and
               pulls out the egg sized diamond. She holds it up. The sun
               refracts off it brilliantly... 

               Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture
               perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she
               heaves it as far as she can into the sea. For the first time
               since they know each other there is nobody around. No people.
               No tentacles. And when they look at each other, something
               else comes to mind besides survival. 

               Finnegan moves towards Trillian. Trillian moves towards
               Finnegan. Their lips move closer, closer... 

               And then, down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE
               WATER! Scares the shit out of them. The audience too.

               But it's just Pantucci. Looking waterlogged and shell-
               shocked. Coughing up half the sea. Finnegan and Trillian help
               him to his feet.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Was it the water in my eyes or were
                         you guys about to...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Because it's cool, you know, I can
                         always take a walk or something
                         down the beach...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Or I could go for a
                         swim...although, I gotta tell
                         you...if I never get in the water
                         again...

                                   BOTH
                         Joey!!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         OK...OK...you don't have to beg me
                         ...I'll stick around...

               And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling,
               teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like no sound or
               animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. Coming from DEEP
               WITHIN THE ISLAND.

                                   PANTUCCI (CONT'D)
                         Or maybe not...

               Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND.
               We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up. MORE STRANGE
               NOISES ARE HEARD. FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES. 

               WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING more of this creepy-looking
               island. And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach. 

               WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING pieces of the smoldering
               ship. Nearly the whole island is VISIBLE now. Dark jungles.
               Craggy mountains. Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth.

                                   FINNEGAN (V.O.)
                         What now...

               The "THING" ROARS again. It's hellacious. 

               AND WE CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END

               An enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the
               water. An autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost
               futuristic in its design. The nose cone is an amazing ultra
               high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING along the side tells us
               this is the "SHINKAI 90000."

               The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and
               barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors
               work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The
               JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic
               position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation
               of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate
               DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and
               dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS
               as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth
               gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks.

         4     ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4

               The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes
               widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below
               sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS,
               HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.

               As it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums
               leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths,
               away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops
               into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty
               thousand feet of water. 

               But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon.

               Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm.

               The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON.
               The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an
               enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone
               pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below.

               THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC
               ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its "hand" is a
               high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies,
               then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock
               into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern. 

               Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the
               cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and
               sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side.

               A desolate, barren, spooky place. Nothing breathes. Nothing
               lives. Or so it would appear. The creepy, foreboding MUSICAL
               SCORE tells us otherwise. The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK
               FISSURE.

               The Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi
               dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN
               TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then,
               dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked
               by a rock-encrusted embankment. 

               The MUSIC builds. 

               The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide
               up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized
               by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And
               the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. 

               As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is
               filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here
               and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of
               several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark
               cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. 

               The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just
               stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.

               The vessel cruises through the valley of death. Everyone is
               nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting
               equipment. 

               Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking.

               Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi
               dome. Giant skeletons everywhere.

               The Shinkai approaches an eerie-looking rock formation. The
               robotic arm comes out. The laser cutter steadies, aims, then
               shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock.

               WHOOSH!! A HUGE JET STREAM OF INKY BLOOD BLASTS OUT OF THE
               FORMATION!

               The Captain and the Science Officers recoil as the inky stuff
               envelopes the plexi-dome, completely blotting out the VIEW.

               The Shinkai VANISHES into a huge cloud of inky blood. We HOLD
               for a LONG OMINOUS BEAT. And then, like a slow-motion
               earthquake, large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift
               in the murky waters. WHALE BONES TOPPLE and SCATTER. Several
               feet under the ancient silt, something is coming alive.

               Everything outside the plexi-dome is still BLACK. Everyone is
               staring at the position board, which shows a large section of
               the OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE, its contours incongruous
               with the rest of the graphic representation. 

               The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks
               commands. The Crew leaps into high gear. 

               Then the Captain reverses the trottle, and petal-to-the-metal
               he starts to back out. 

               The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome. Then suddenly, and
               impossibly, the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes
               ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS
               BREAKS. Lots of YELLING in Japanese. 

               The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on
               it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it
               stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead
               quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is
               HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing
               across the outside of the hull. Very creepy. 

               The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.
               And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can.
               The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP.
               WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING
               DIMPLES, CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM.
               And then the SHINKAI IMPLODES. A massive CHURNING SWIRL of
               water, metal and men.

               propelled, it seems, by the music blasting out of four state

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see LEILA, a muscular Filipina
               clambering over the foredeck. She's dripping wet. Tough as

               Pantucci works his wrench around an engine mount. And his
               nervous eyes around six men, big, bad men, standing on the
               far side of the engines out in a narrow passage. 

               A Maori(VIVO). Two Aussies(MASON and MULLIGAN). A
               Samoan(MAMOOLI). A Chinese(CHIN). And an Aborigine (BILLY).
               Tattooed, armed to the teeth, packed in Kevlar body armor.
               Mercenaries. Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your
               hand. And a sixth man. HANOVER. The obvious leader.
               Smoother than the rest, but still showing the edge of a man
               risen from their ranks. He consults his watch with a growing
               concern.

               Finnegan hits a button on his console. The Stones are
               replaced by the first chords of LAYLA.

                             (nervous)
                         Finnegan this is as mean a pile of
                         shit as we ever carried...

               Pantucci notices Hanover impatiently looking at his watch
               again, and nods for a mass of Aussie mean and muscle named
               MASON to follow him up a ladder.

                                   PANTUCCI (CONT'D)
                         ...and some of it's coming your
                         way.

               He quickly pulls out a wrench, slaps it over a bolt and
               tightens it down. The leak stops. He blows on the WRENCH like
               it's a six-shooter, then spins it at the speed of light and
               holsters it into his toolbelt.

               As Finnegan is watching the sea ahead, swathed in the
               shrieking Clapton guitar solos, the hatch opens. 

               Hanover enters, followed by Mason, who leaves the hatch door
               ajar. 

               Finnegan's eyes remain fixed on the sea. His ears on the
               Clapton. 

               Hanover and Mason hold onto any available rail as the boat
               slams over the waves.

                                   HANOVER
                         You remember the first time we met
                         Finnegan? I think you were just
                         starting out...smuggling gold off
                         Sumatra for those two
                         Chinese...what did we use to call
                         them?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we
                         strolling down memory lane for any
                         particular reason?

                                   HANOVER
                         No, it just struck me as odd...I
                         don't see you for all these years
                         and you've still got the same tape
                         stuck in the box.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You know what they say...the
                         classics are eternal.

               Hanover looks at the Topo Imager. Holding onto the rail to
               keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea.

                                   HANOVER
                         So where are we?

               Finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Right here...middle of nowhere...

                         And where is our point of arrival?

               Finnegan points to another spot on the map.

                         Right here...middle of

                         The one you came up to ask...are we
                         on schedule?

                         Take note Mr. Mason...this is why
                         you hire a professional...No
                         whining. No excuses.

                         They were...but they musta been
                         talking about another Finnegan...
                         because the one I heard about was
                         as rough as they came...the one I'm
                         looking at is, well, about as
                         current as the music.

                         splashing around in a sea of
                         testosterone.

                         I don't mind him...but I do think
                         it's time for him to get back down
                         below with the rest of the
                         playgroup.

                         And who's gonna make me?

               Finnegan looks at Mason...at the open hatchway just behind
               him...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The Finnegan you heard about.

               ...and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead. The force
               of acceleration tumbles Hanover into the console. Mason
               tumbles out the open hatchway, down the stairs behind him. As
               he rises, Hanover regards Finnegan for a moment. A smile
               flits across his face.

                                   HANOVER
                         That's why we're sill around
                         Finnegan...you and me... Nothing
                         gets the feathers up. Business is
                         business. Eh?

               Finnegan's hand finds the console. He hits a button. The
               first strains of Led Zepplin's WHOLE LOTTA LOVE comes roaring
               out of the speakers.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         And the classics are eternal.

               Finnegan cranks the sound to the max, pulls back on both
               steer sticks, and holds on, as the force of acceleration
               hammers him into the pylon.

               night, the CLAY PIGEONS are glow-in-the-dark. They EXPLODE
               over the WATERSPORTS PLATFORM, where TWO JET SKIS swing from

               Rigged for a formal party. Chinese lanterns sway in the
               breeze. A band plays. Hundreds of wealthy Passengers, the men
               in tuxedos, the women in drop dead gowns, dripping with
               jewelry, dance, flirt, gossip, as an endless stream of
               waiters ply the floor with champagne laden trays.
               CLOSE ON: The sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the
               foot of a woman, stopping at the top of the deck. PAN UP: A
               shimmering golden gown, high slit on the sides to reveal a
               perfect set of legs, a runway model's body, a cover girl's
               face...and a thief's sharp ferret eyes. TRILLIAN. A class act
               from top to bottom. A head turner for either sex, and knows
               it. She holds an orchid in her hand. Trillian scans the
               crowd, looking for her prey...and finds him. Her POV. The
               Ship's smug Captain. JEAN BAPTISTE DELCROIX. She fixes the
               orchid in her hair just so, about to move...

                                   OLD WOMAN
                         He said an orchid and a beautiful
                         woman belonged together... It was
                         our first date.

               Trillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed
               impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except
               from her eyes. Kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the
               night.

                                   OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                         He said that it was the orchid I
                         wore that made him fall in love
                         with me...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         He sounds like a real gentleman.

                                   OLD WOMAN
                         The best of the best he was... This
                         cruise was supposed to be our 60th
                         anniversary gift to each other. He
                         died last Spring...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I'm so sorry...

                                   OLD WOMAN
                         I was going to wear one...special
                         for him...like a memory...

               The Old Woman looks at the orchid. And then at Trillian.

                                   OLD WOMAN (CONT'D)
                         But without him here I don't know
                         why I should.

               Trillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the
               lapel of the woman's jacket.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Because an orchid and a beautiful
                         woman belong together.

               The smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving,
               sincere. The moment between them is broken by the keen clear
               sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute.

                             (French)
                         Is it true what they say about a
                         captain and his boat.

               The Captain's libido rises as he gazes into Trillian's come
               hither eyes.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Is what true madame?

               Trillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are
               pursed inches from the captain's.

                         boat...the bigger the man... 

               His breath catches.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         It is a theory I would be glad to
                         put to the test.

               Trillian draws even closer. If looks could cause a man to
               climax.

               moment to a passenger introducing his wife.

               C.U. on her hand by the side of her dress. A man's wallet
               held surreptitiously. Her fingers open the wallet, extract a
               thin gold card with a black stripe. She discards the wallet,
               keeps the card, and disappears into the crowd.

               A massive fist plows into Pantucci's stomach. He drops from
               the arms of MULLIGAN, a scar-faced Irishman with a buzz cut.
               As quickly as he is doubled over he is yanked up straight by
               the man who hit him, VIVO, a merciless Maori, covered by
               tattoos, topped off with venom.

                         box.

               Hanover watches calmly as BILLY, the Aborigine, cracks his
               fist against the side of Pantucci's head, knocking him out of
               Vivo's arms.

                                   BILLY
                         At home we denosy the nosy.

               BILLY hoists Pantucci. He draws his knife under Pantucci's
               bloody nose.

               The Chinese merc steps forward, and whaps Pantucci upside the
               head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick. Pantucci hits the
               wall hard, crumbling. Chin lifts him.

                         I vote we slit his throat THEN
                         throw him overboard...

               Mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm
               back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face. He never gets the
               punch off. His arm is caught from behind. He looks over his
               shoulder to Finnegan. Gripping his wrist. Right in his face.

                                   FINNEGAN

                         don't get a vote.

               Mason, enraged, swings with his free hand. Finnegan twists
               his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall,
               knocking the big man senseless. The other mercenaries go to
               draw their weapons. Before the guns are out of holsters,
               Finnegan swings a spear gun into Hanover's face, an inch from
               his eye.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)

               Finnegan cocks the spear. CLICK! Hanover does not blink.
               Everyone freezes. With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci
               to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. Finnegan backs
               out of the room.

                         Who asked any?

                         He did...with a crowbar...you know
                         the rules on a broken contract.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I know it...but you want to get
                         where you want to get, and back? I
                         need a chief engineer, and unless
                         you got a replacement, I'd highly
                         recommend overlooking the
                         indiscretion.

               With that Finnegan leads Pantucci out of the hold, slamming
               the door behind him.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Thanks...

               Finnegan turns his gaze to Pantucci. It makes the smaller man
               quiver.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You put me in that position again
                         I'll throw you overboard myself.

               Finnegan stalks off. Pantucci swallows hard, knowing he means
               it.

                                   CANTON
                         Well you can still proceed with
                         your plans then...in

               Canton exits. The Captain steps forward, and removes the
               diamond ring from Trillian's hand.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Mademoiselle...you are not a lady.

               He slaps her across the face. Trillian flushes, touches the
               drop of blood at her lip...and decks the Captain with a
               vicious right cross.

                                   TRILLIAN

               A hatch door bursts open. Trillian is thrown inside. The DOOR
               SLAMS SHUT. Trillian looks around. No windows. One door. Lots
               of fruit and vegetables. 

               Trillian accepts the hopelessness of her situation. She takes
               an apple, sits down and bites deeply, running her options.

               pulses out of the speakers. Finnegan is prepping the wound
               over Pantucci's eye for sutures. 

               As he swabs it carefully, Leila is at the helm keeping the

               The top of another wooden crate is popped revealing the
               answer to Pantucci's question: a chilling display of
               firepower. Pulse rifles. Hand held gatling guns with laser

               Then another WAVE EXPLODES, forty feet to the right. Then
               ANOTHER, eighty feet to the left. And then ALMOST SEEN: Huge,
               black, ominous THINGS seem to be SQUIRMING beneath the water.

               another page.

               A LONG SCARY BEAT.

               And then suddenly -- She SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY and gives a sharp

               from it. The WATER in the pool BUBBLES, and GURGLES, and then

               Finnegan notices Billy, Mulligan and Vivo setting two
               catapult like devices on the front of the deck.

               Leila exits. Finnegan's eyes go up from the action on deck to
               the radar screen, where a blip, fast moving, right toward the
               jet foil catches his attention.

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING REVEALS -- The speedboat from the Fuji
               Maru hurtling at the hull! BAAROOOOM!!! The speedboat slams
               into the Saipan. Instant FIREBALL.

               The left steering stick dies in Finnegan's hand.

               fire extinguisher frantically. Where the shrapnel entered the
               hull water now spurts with every wave. Smoke and water, oil
               and fire.

                         Shit!!

               Finnegan locks the sticks down, and runs out.

               TRACK WITH Finnegan running through the smoke filled hold,
               past Hanover and the merc's who are pulling themselves off
               the floor, right into the...

               ENGINE ROOM. Where Pantucci is beside himself in smoke and
               sputtering flame.

                                   PANTUCCI

                         driving this thing?

               Finnegan notices something on the floor. He picks up a shard
               of the speedboat propeller. Strange. Hanover steps into the
               room.

                                   HANOVER
                         What happened?

               Finnegan looks at the piece of speedboat in his hand.

                         We ran into a speedboat...

               He shows the piece of speed boat to Hanover. Who stares at
               it. Finnegan sees the hint of recognition in his eyes.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Speedboat in the middle of the

                         We can't...we got one engine dead,
                         and the other limping badly.

                         I spent two years building these
                         things...screw your schedule!

               Mason grabs Pantucci by the throat, lifting him off the
               ground.

                                   MASON
                         You little weasel!

               Finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of
               Mason's knees buckling him to the floor. In the blink of an
               eye there is the barrel of a .45 pressed hard against his
               head, Hanover at the trigger end.

                                   HANOVER

                         Then you better start swimming.

               Hanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of
               the gun. Finnegan's head spins. He touches the corner of his
               mouth, and comes away with blood, and a look of murder in his
               eyes. Hanover slams a round in the chamber.

               BAM! BAM! Two grappling hooks fly from the barrels of the two
               catapults bolted to the deck, landing on the deck of the Fuji
               Maru, which looms above the Saipan. Vivo pulls on the lines
               until they go taut. Finnegan, Pantucci, and Leila stand by
               watching as the mercs in full assault gear, communication

                         Kwan bat! Kwam bat! Booom!!

               She points the acetalyne tank she works with.

                                   BILLY
                             (bothered)
                         Yeah...yeah...yeah...

               Billy heads for the deck. Leila looks after him in disgust.

                                   LEILA
                         Asshole...

               She ignites her torch, is about to flick her visor down again
               when a loud gurgling, a sucking sound, stops her. She cuts
               the torch. Looks around nervously...and then she spots the
               suction hose sucking away. 

               She smiles to herself. Flips the visor, fires the torch, and
               goes back to work.

                                                       CUT TO:

        66     FUJI MARU DECK PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                       66

               An alert Mulligan leads Finnegan and Pantucci around a
               corner. Vivo brings up the rear.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         You'd think they'd set a deck
                         watch...

               FLASH TO: The deck full of people partying, carousing. The
               railing is lined with 15 lifeboats suspended in their
               harnesses. 

               FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Finnegan, Pantucci and Vivo staring
               at a completely deserted deck. The lifeboat harnesses swing
               in the breeze, eerily empty. Mulligan looks back to Vivo.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         I thought the plan was we'd
                         evacuate them after we got through.

                                   VIVO
                         Maybe plans changed...

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Plans don't change...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Maybe it's the wrong ship.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Shut up!

               And then a strange yowl echoes from somewhere deep in the
               bowels of the ship. Finnegan and Pantucci trade a look.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Let's just keep going.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (nervous)
                         You ain't giving the orders here!

               And again the yowl. Everyone freezes.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Let's keep going!

        67     CRYSTAL POOL DECK - NIGHT                               67

               Hanover, Mason, and Chin set foot on the deserted pool deck.

               FLASH TO: The pool deck is jammed with people partying. The
               band playing. Two kids toss a beach ball back and forth. The
               ball flies over one boy's head... 

               FLASH BACK TO: The ball falls into the empty pool...Where the
               band's instruments litter the bottom along a big jagged
               crack.

                                   MASON
                         What the...

               Uneasy, Hanover and his men look around at the over turned
               chairs. The smashed aquarium. Chin bends down and picks up a
               small squid from the bottom of the smashed aquarium. The
               squid wraps its tentacles around Chin's hand almost
               immediately. Chin regards it with curiosity.

                                   HANOVER
                         Focus on the task Mr. Chin...

               ...and then the yowl freezes them. C.U. on Hanover's face.
               His eyes flicker with uncertainty...and a tinge of fear.

                                                       CUT TO:

               DING! FLASH TO: A glass elevator descending through the
               spectacular atrium, full of elegant well-dressed people
               laughing, chatting. 

               DING! FLASH BACK TO: Mulligan, Vivo, Pantucci, and Finnegan,
               standing amidst the shattered glass and broken furniture,
               whirling to the elevator door opening. Mulligan, nerves
               ajangle, and Vivo, swing their pulse rifles up hard as the
               door opens to reveal...and empty elevator! DING! The door
               closes. The car starts to ascend in the eerie silence. The
               mercs watch it go with growing uneasiness.

                                                       CUT TO:

        69     FUJI MARU BRIDGE - DAWN                                 69

               The door to the bridge is KICKED OPEN. Mason and Chin leap
               inside. Guns out front. On edge. The overhead lights flicker
               on and off. The imager screens are all black. The STEERING
               WHEEL slowly ROCKS. As if an invisible captain is steering a
               ghost ship. Hanover ENTERS. Eyes shifting. Suspicious, and a
               bit nervous.

                                   HANOVER
                         What the hell is going on?

               Mulligan leads Finnegan, Pantucci, Vivo into the casino. The
               place looks like a mess. Tables and chairs are upended.
               Glasses and bottles are shattered everywhere. And there's
               BLOOD on the floor. 

               A BELL RINGS LOUDLY and the TROLLEY CAR STARTS TO MOVE!

                                   ELECTRONIC VOICE
                         Next stop, Chinatown!

               Everyone jumps, freaked. Mulligan and Vivo spin around and
               OPEN FIRE. Start BLOWING the shit out of the TROLLEY CAR. The
               GUNS sound like nothing we've ever heard. ROLLING THUNDER.
               Absolutely deafening.

                                                       CUT TO:

        71     FUJI MARU - DAY                                         71

               The GUNFIRE ECHOES through the hull. Suddenly, with a loud
               SPLASH, a sixteen-foot-long LIFEBOAT pops to the surface.
               Then another LIFE BOAT POPS UP. Then ANOTHER. Then THREE MORE
               off to the port side. Then TWO MORE off to the starboard.
               It's as if the SOUND of the GUNFIRE is somehow releasing the
               boats from their watery graves. They start to drift away.
               Spooky quiet.

                                                       CUT TO:

        72     FRISCO BAR AND CASINO - NIGHT                           72

               BULLETS RAKE the Trolley's metal sides. The WINDSHIELD
               EXPLODES. Finnegan yells at Mulligan and Vivo --

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Guys!! Whoa! WHOA! WHOA! WHOOOAAA!!

               Finnegan finally tilts the muzzle of Mulligan's gun to the
               ceiling. They stop firing. A little wigged-out. Their
               professional demeanor going by the boards. All goes quiet.
               They look at Finnegan, who is the picture of calm.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Guys...get a grip.

               The Trolley car reverses. The ELECTRONIC VOICE is now CRACKED
               --

                                   ELECTRONIC VOICE
                         Next stop, Fisherman's Wharf.

               Mulligan whirls, his gun poised. Just then his headset
               crackles.

                                   HANOVER (V.O.)

               Finnegan leans in towards Mulligan's mike.

                                   FINNEGAN
                             (into radio)
                         Your boys just killed a trolley car
                         Red One.

               Mulligan pulls the radio away.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (into radio)

                         Advise on how to proceed.

        73     CONNING TOWER - NIGHT                                   73

               Hanover looks around at the empty bridge, the blinking
               lights.

                                   HANOVER
                         Stay to the schedule. Stay to the
                         plan. Nothing has changed.

               But the look in Hanover's slightly unnerved eyes tells a
               different story.

                                                       CUT TO:

        74     FUGI MARU STORAGE ROOM - DAY                            74

               Trillian goggily crawls out from under a mound of boxes. Her
               left eye's got a nice purple shiner. Her elegant gown is
               ripped. 

               A VERY STRANGE SOUND coming from behind the wall. Wet. Gooey.
               Slithery. Ominous. 

               Trillian freezes.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Hello?

               The SOUND slowly MOVES across the wall. Then another WALL
               starts to GURGLE. Trillian spins around. She forces herself
               not to panic. Very cautiously, taking small measured steps
               she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it.
               No go. 

               The gurgling ripples above her. Her mouth goes dry as her
               eyes follow the sound across the ceiling. Her hand goes to
               her hair. She pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels
               down until she is eye level with the door lock. She begins to
               pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling
               above. Suddenly the sound stops. The silence makes Trillian's
               heart sound that much louder. She sidles close to the wall.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Hello?

               Still silence. Cautious, she taps on the wall. For a moment
               nothing. And then... 

               WHAMM!! 

               Something slams against the wall from the other side in
               response. Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in
               her throat.

                                                       CUT TO:

               A MAZE of pipes, hoses, gears, engines and catwalks. THINGS
               are HISSING, HUMMING, RUMBLING and CLANKING. A spooky place.
               Dark. Damp. Eerie. Ominous. Mulligan and Vivo, looking more
               nervous by the moment, lead the way. Finnegan and Pantucci
               follow.

                                   PANTUCCI

                                   PANTUCCI
                         ...Like a house in the suburbs...
                         maybe a couple of kids...some sort
                         of business...be in the bowling
                         league...go to the ball games...

               Finnegan turns to Pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost
               kind.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...it's okay...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What? You don't think I can have a
                         normal life?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...look at me...

               He forces Pantucci to look him in the eyes.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         We're gonna get what we gotta
                         get... do what we gotta do...and
                         get the hell outta here...okay?

               Pantucci draws his strength from Finnegan. He forces himself
               to take a deep breath.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Okay...

               Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across
               the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the
               wall.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What the...???

               He and Vivo spin their guns at the pipes. The red dots of
               their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. Nothing.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Come on...the sooner we get outta
                         here the better I'll feel. Mulligan
                         and Vivo move forward.

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (quiet)
                         Finnegan...

               Finnegan turns to Pantucci, who has not moved from where he
               hit the wall.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         It's okay...come on...

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (scared)
                         I'm stuck...

               Pantucci tries to pull away from the wall. He is stuck.

                         Hey! What are you trying to pull!

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (pleading)
                         John...

               Finnegan takes Pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring
               Mulligan.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Relax your arms...slowly...that's
                         it...

               As Finnegan pulls, Pantucci does as he is told. He slips away
               from the wall. The jacket doesn't.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What the...

               He reaches out to touch the wall. Finnegan grabs his wrist,
               grabs a flashlight from Vivo's utility belt and shines it on
               the wall. Their POV -- the entire wall is covered in a
               strange, yellow, secreted GELATIN. Laid on in some sort of
               weird, inhuman, geometric pattern. Like a spider web.

               Leila has welded half the hole shut. A GUSH OF WATER suddenly
               pours through the other half. Leila cuts the torch.

                                   LEILA
                         Gebop!!

               The KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK of the PUMP is like a loud scary
               HEARTBEAT. Leila removes her blast visor. Wipes her brow. 

               -- A MANGLED CORPSE GUSHES IN through the gaping hole! 

               LEILA SCREAMS. Bloody murder. Scared shitless. Quickly backs
               away. Actually, it's only half a corpse. The bottom half
               having been eaten away. It's wearing a tuxedo. The corpse's
               face is tightly constricted, eyes wide open, a grotesque
               death mask. Leila shakes like a leaf, waist-deep in seawater.

               Billy is staring out at all the lifeboats as they drift away.
               All he can hear is the loud KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK of the PUMP. He
               talks into his headset --

                                   BILLY
                             (into radio)
                         I dunno where they came from,
                         turned around and there they were.
                             (pause)
                         No, no passengers.

               Leila trembles in the waist-high water. The PUMP'S HEARTBEAT
               seems to have gotten louder. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Leila slowly starts edging her way around the corpse. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Her eyes are transfixed, staring at the abomination, too
               scared to scream. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Her back is to the gaping hole as she slowly starts to pass
               in front of it. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               The water swirls around her waist. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               She's almost past the gaping hole now. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK... 

               Then something grabs her! She SCREAMS! And falls back towards
               the gaping hole -- But it's only a twisted piece of metal off
               a strut. She exhales. Relieved. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK. 

               Suddenly, LEILA'S whole body SPASMS. She SCREECHES wildly, in
               great pain. The she's RIPPED backward out through the gaping
               hole. Gone. WATER SLOSHES back in. 

               KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.

               Knee deep in water, an edgy Mulligan watches Finnegan as he
               disassembles pieces of a thermal carburetor from an auxiliary
               generator. His eyes keep shifting around.
               Over in the far corner Vivo is watching Pantucci working over
               a metal lathe, repairing the cylinder head. Metal-on-metal.
               Vivo sits up on a barrel, trying to keep his feet out of the
               water.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The hulls of these things are
                         supposed to be impregnable...

                                   MULLIGAN
                         So?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         So...If the hull's impregnable why
                         are my feet wet?

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Why don't you just stop figuring
                         and keep working so we can get the
                         hell out of here?

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Why don't you help us so we can get
                         done faster so we can get the hell
                         out of here?

                                   MULLIGAN
                         'Cause grease monkey ain't in my
                         job description dick head...

               Vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel.

                                   VIVO
                         What I want to know is why the
                         goddamn ocean is always
                         cold...since I'm a kid I hate god
                         damn cold water.

               Then out of the corner of his eye, Vivo sees SOMETHING MOVE.
               He spins around. Nothing but pipes and hoses.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (nervous)
                         What was that?

                                   VIVO
                         Nothing.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Someone's back there.

                                   VIVO
                         Hey! Come out here!

               Finnegan and Pantucci stop working. All eyes are focused on
               the maze of pipes. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING and RUMBLING.
               Nothing moves.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Check it out!

                                   VIVO
                         Hey! You hear me? Come out! Still
                         no response.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Will you check it the hell out!!

               Disgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly.

                                   VIVO
                         Man this shit is cold!

               He walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. His pulse rifle
               rising.

                                   VIVO (CONT'D)
                         I'm gonna kick your ass for putting
                         me through this...

               Then he hears a strange SLURPING and SUCKING SOUND coming
               from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway.

                                   VIVO (CONT'D)
                         I'm not screwing around with you
                         man...I hate the cold water.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What is it man?

                                   VIVO
                         I'm looking...

               Vivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading
               down the little alleyway. He looks behind some pipes. The
               SLURPING gets LOUDER. Then he sees it. His eyes widen --

                                   VIVO (CONT'D)
                         On shit!

               And that's the last thing he ever says. Because just then,
               from a dark area between the pipes, SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT!

               Mulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement
               as Vivo is viciously YANKED into the pipes.
               A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall.
               Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Vivo!! Vivo!!

               As Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads
               for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. Mulligan swings around.
               KACHUNK!! His rifle is armed. The laser dot fixes on
               Finnegan's forehead.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Touch it and you're dead, asshole!

               Finnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!

                                   MULLIGAN
                         What happened to Vivo?! What the
                         hell happened to Vivo?

               Everybody's breathing hard. Freaked out. Major tension. Blood
               drips down the wall.

                                                       CUT TO:

               Trillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit
               nervous, something is definitely not right here.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Helloooo?

               She shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut
               dress she pulls the Captain's gold security card. She is
               about to run it through the reader slot when...

               V.O.

               Ahem... She spins to...Hanover, Mason, Mamooli and Chin.
               Looking grim.

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (recovering)
                         I'm sorry... This area is for
                         authorized personnel only. As the
                         assistant to the Purser, I'm afraid
                         I'll have to ask you to vacate...

               Mason and Chin lift their pulse-rifles. KACHUNK!!

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Or maybe not.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where is everybody? 

               Trillian is confused --

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What do you mean?

               Hanover steps forward, right in her face.

                                   HANOVER
                             (threatening)
                         I mean...where is everybody?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Poolside?

               Hanover grabs Trillian by the throat and slams her against
               the wall. He rams his gun against her forehead.

                                   HANOVER
                         You tell it straight or I pull the
                         trigger. Who are you?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (choking)
                         A passenger...

               Hanover blinks.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where are the other passengers?

               Trillian shrugs. Mason grabs the card out of her hand.

                                   MASON
                         Forget her...let's get what we came
                         for and get the hell out of here!

               Mason runs the card through the slot. The ELECTRONICS KICK
               IN. LIGHTS FLASH. TUMBLERS ROLL. CLICK! It unlocks. Hanover's
               HEADSET comes alive with Mulligan SCREAMING.

                                   HANOVER
                         Mulligan?? What?? I can't hear
                         you?? Repeat I...

               -- Mason JERKS the vault door open. A FIRE-AXE SWING DOWN
               into his head, WHUMP! Kills him instantly. Eyes wide open.
               Everybody freaks out. Jumps back. Hanover lets go of
               Trillian, and stares into the vault directly at Nigel Canton.
               Holding the axe.

                                   CANTON
                         Oh my God. I didn't mean to...

               Behind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain,
               his clothes are ripped up, REVEALING nasty looking RED SCARS,
               blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         I thought it was one of them!

               Chin jams his rifle to the middle of Canton's forehead, and
               cocks a round into the chamber.

                                   HANOVER
                         Stand down soldier!

               But this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order.
               Hanover grabs Chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal
               yank.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         I said...

               He slams Chin against the wall. In the process he loses his
               headset.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Stand down!!

               Chin and Hanover stare at each other, their chests heaving.
               Mason finally drops to the ground. All she wrote.

                                   CANTON
                         I didn't mean to! I though it was
                         one of them!

                                   HANOVER
                         One of who?!

                                                       CUT TO:

        81     MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT                                    81

               The machinery is sputtering, and sparking, shorting, steaming
               as the sea rises. Mulligan, in a panic, has backed Finnegan
               and Pantucci into a corner. He screams over his headset.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Hanover!...Hanover! Come in! Come
                         in you son-of-a-bitch!

               No response. A sucking sound comes from the dark mass of
               pipes. Mulligan spins.

                                   MULLIGAN (CONT'D)
                         Hanover!! Hanover!!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Forget them...

               Mulligan spins back to Finnegan and Pantucci.

                                   MULLIGAN
                             (fried)
                         Shut up! You hear me!!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         ...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.

                                   MULLIGAN
                         Shut up, man, just shut the hell
                         up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What's there to think about?? That
                         THING back there...

                                   MULLIGAN
                         There ain't no thing here!! No
                         thing!! There's you him and me!!
                         Got it! You him and...

               Suddenly, Mulligan's LEGS are suddenly JERKED OUT from under
               him. He hits the floor hard. Starts FIRING WILDLY. 

               Finnegan and Pantucci hit the watery deck. 

               BULLETS RICOCHET everywhere. Mulligan is WHIPPED across the
               floor. SCREAMING in fear. His pulse-rifle goes flying. He's
               SLAMMED into a metal pylon, then SUCKED into a dark void in
               the pipes. All in the blink of an eye. 

               Finnegan grabs Mulligan's pulse-rifle. OPENS FIRE. BLASTING
               the shit out of anything and everything that moves.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Grab the parts!!

               Pantucci grabs the knapsack, cramming as many parts as he can
               into it as Finnegan keeps firing into the steaming, creaking,
               sparking machinery.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         I'll cover! Move! Move!

               Pantucci doesn't have to be told twice. He runs like hell,
               with Finnegan firing a final burst, and following.

                                                       CUT TO:

        82     VAULT - NIGHT                                           82

               Everyone hears the MASSIVE GUNFIRE. Hanover looks around for
               the source of the sound. He finds it in his discarded
               headset.

                                   HANOVER
                         This is Red one! Come in Red two!

               The gunfire stops, replaced by an ominous, horrifying,
               sucking sound.

                                   CANTON
                             (panicked)
                         It's them! We've got to get off!

               He runs out of the vault. The Captain follows close behind.
               Hanover listens to the sucking sound getting louder and
               louder.

                                   HANOVER
                         Let's find them!

                                   CHIN
                         What about the vault?

                                   HANOVER
                         It's not going anywhere...

               Hanover rushes out with Chin right behind. 

               Only Trillian remains, breathing deeply, scared...but not
               scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the
               first place. She goes right to the vault, opens one of the
               boxes, removes the giant diamond, drops it down her
               decolletage, pulls her high heels off, and runs out.

                                                       CUT TO:

        83     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     83

               Finnegan and Pantucci run to the end of a long section of
               metal grating, right below a staircase, to catch their
               breath. Everything has gone dead quiet, except for the
               billowing and clanging of the engines. Smoke and sparks
               obscure their vision.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Finnegan, what the hell was that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't know...you got what we
                         need?

                                   PANTUCCI
                         If I don't, I ain't going back to
                         get it...you think we're safe?

               Both of them listen to the silence. And then, at the far end
               of the grating, one grate rises...and falls. Finnegan and
               Pantucci watch, transfixed. Then, like a locomotive gathering
               speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and
               faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two
               of them.

               LOUDERFASTERLOUDERFASTER!!!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Come on!!

               Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they
               can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and
               falls. Silence returns. Except for the steaming, creaking
               machinery...and an ominous sucking sound.

                                                       CUT TO:

        84     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                      84

               Trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight
               elevator. Looking over her shoulder, she hits the button. The
               elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to
               hold a dozen people. Trillian rushes in and hits the up
               button. She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors
               close...until the elevator starts going down.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Up!! I want to go up!

               She panics. And starts pushing the up button frantically, her
               heart pounding in her chest.
               There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator
               descending...until something drops on the roof with a THUMP!
               Trillian screams. The elevator comes to a bumps stop.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         No...No...

               Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then
               the car starts to move again.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Go up...please go up!

               Trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail.
               The car continues its inexorable descent. Finally, in
               desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. The elevator
               stops. The emergency SIREN WHINES. A LONG BEAT. Nothing
               moves...and then...

               WHAM! Something beats on the roof, trying to break in. And
               again -- WHAM! The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its
               descent. Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the
               ceiling, scared. The ELEVATOR DINGS! 

               Startled, TRILLIAN SCREAMS. The DOORS start to OPEN.
               Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a
               high heel. The DOORS OPEN. -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN! Trillian
               swings her high heel...right into Pantucci's face! 

               Finnegan plows in right behind him.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         OWWW!! OOWWW!!!

               Trillian tries to run out. Finnegan grabs her.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I'm not staying here!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         It ain't any better out there!

               Trillian struggles. Finnegan does not let go of her.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Lady, I'm telling you...

               Trillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegan's
               hand, breaking his grip.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         OWW!

               Just then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts
               to ascend.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Now look what you did!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I saved your life is what I did!

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Who asked you to!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What the hell's going on here?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You're with that other bunch,
                         right?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         What other bunch?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         The thieves.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'm not a thief.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Then who are you?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'm their ride. 

               Trillian hears music to her ears.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You have a boat?

               Her demeanor changes, her voice goes to honey.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Finnegan!

               Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at
               the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the
               ceiling. All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the
               ceiling...followed by a sucking sound.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         It's up there!!

               Finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling. The
               sucking sound stops.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not anymore.

               The elevator stops. DING! The door opens. Finnegan whirls his
               rifle, rising. Trillian lifts her high heel, ready to
               strike... 

               Hanover, Chin, and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on
               the car. The Captain and Canton quiver behind them. There is
               a momentary stand off.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where are my men?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Dead.

                                   CHIN
                         YAAHHH!!

               Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash
               Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the
               rear wall of the elevator. Mamooli jumps Finnegan from
               behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat.
               Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his
               face. Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar
               plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at
               Mamooli's throat in a flash. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian. Impressed. She had no idea.

                                   HANOVER
                         Drop it!

               Finnegan looks up into the barrel of Hanover's gun...and a
               pair of eyes that will use it. Finnegan does as he is told.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Now, back up!

               Again, Finnegan does as he is told.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Everybody in!

               The Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply. As they
               slip in, Trillian tries to slip out. Hanover swings his gun
               on her.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Where are you going?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (freezing)
                         Nowhere...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Hanover, listen...

                                   HANOVER
                         Shut up!

               Hanover hit the elevator button. The elevator starts to rise.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Now, where's Mulligan? Where's
                         Vivo?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I told you...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Man, there's something here! On the
                         boat!

                                   CANTON
                         You see? You see?

                                   HANOVER
                         Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now
                         here's what we're doing... Mamooli
                         is going to take you back to fix
                         your engines, Chin and I are
                         staying here to finish the job...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Did you clear this?

                                   HANOVER
                         With who?

               All of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some
               giant hand was yanking on the cable.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         With that...

               And then, the elevator jerks down again. And up. Everyone is
               thrown about like straw. Everyone is shouting, panicked.
               And then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking
               surrounds the car. The cable starts twisting, creaking
               sickeningly above their heads.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         It's gonna snap the cable!

               Trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Open! Open! God damn it!!

               Finnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Help me!!

               Pantucci, then Mamooli, then Hanover and Chin pull at the
               doors as Trillian keeps hitting the buttons. The doors part a
               bit.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         They're coming! They're coming!

               The doors fly open to...a solid wall.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Oh shit...

               And silence...until the doors slam shut...the cable
               snaps...and the car plummets! Screaming and shouting mixes
               with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame
               against the shaft. Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator.

        13     12 -- 11 -- 10 -- 9 -- 8 -- 7 -- 6 -- 5 -- 4!           13

               An AUTOMATED VOICE rapidly CALLS OUT right along with it --

                                   VOICE
                         4th floor. 3rd floor. 2nd floor.
                         1st floor...

               Down, down, down it goes. Faster and faster. But the elevator
               doesn't stop at the first floor. It keeps dropping. The FLOOR
               INDICATOR BLINKS: "SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL. SUBLEVEL."

                                   CANTON
                         It's taking us to the bottom of the
                         ship!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         HANG ON!

               CABLES SNAP. METAL SCREAMS. The ELEVATOR starts to BUCKLE.
               Which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways
               in the shaft which slows it down. The it HITS bottom with a
               resounding crash.

                                                       CUT TO:

        85     SUBLEVEL LOBBY - DAY                                    85

               The DOORS BLOW OUT into the darkened hallway. For a long
               moment nothing moves, then Finnegan tumbles out of the
               elevator. Rising painfully. One after another the others exit
               into the dark lobby.

                                   HANOVER
                         Where are we?

                                   CANTON
                         The sublevel lobby.

               Finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles.

                                   HANOVER
                         Don't touch it!

               Finnegan looks up to Hanover standing a bit shakily, his own
               rifle trained on Finnegan.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You shoot me and you got no ride
                         home...

               And with that, Finnegan picks up the gun. A test of wills.
               Finnegan wins, and then turns to the Captain.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         You the Captain?

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Yes.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         How do we get out of here?

                                   CAPTAIN
                         We have to make it to the third
                         deck...

               Pantucci steps on something. CRUNCH! He looks down, his eyes
               widen.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Oh no!! Oh no!! Finnegan!!!

               He starts dancing around, trying not to step on whatever it
               is. Trillian looks down and SCREAMS. 

               Everybody freaks -- 

               Finnegan grabs a flashlight from Chin's utility belt, and
               sweeps the beam over the lobby. The entire floor of the lobby
               is littered with shattered HUMAN SKELETONS. Picked clean and
               spit out. Just like the earlier whale bones. 

               Then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the
               metal WALLS suddenly EXPANDS and FLEXES. Everybody feezes.
               And then the FLEXING suddenly comes RACING down either side
               of the hallway, accompanied by the most god-awful PRIMORDIAL
               SCREECH!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         This way!

               FINNEGAN BOLTS. Everybody else right behind him. The FLEXING
               and SCREECHING VANISHES into the walls.

                                                       CUT TO:

        86     FUJI MARY & SAIPAN - DAY                                86

               RAIN POURS DOWN on the Fuji Maru and the Saipan as they bob
               in the waves, surrounded by endless choppy ocean waters.

                                                       CUT TO:

        87     SAIPAN ENGINE ROOM - DAY                                87

               Billy comes down the steps, gun out front, looking around.

                                   BILLY
                         Hey you! Muscles! Out here!

               There is no reply. The only sound is the sucking of the pump.

                                   BILLY (CONT'D)
                         O.K. You want it that way... 

               He ENTERS the waist-high water.

                                   BILLY (CONT'D)
                         ...when I find you, you pay...

               Billy heads deeper into the hold.

                                                       CUT TO:

        88     MACHINE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER                            88

               Damp, dark and disgusting. A MAZE of pipes and gears lines
               the walls. Finnegan SLAMS the HATCH shut. Dogs it tight.
               Everyone's gathering themselves around the room: Trillian,
               Pantucci, Hanover, Mamooli, Chin, the Captain and Canton.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         We've gotta call for help.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Yeah man, no shit, call in the
                         Marines.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         We can't...all the communication
                         systems went down.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         So get them back up.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         I don't know how.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Hey I can fix any damn thing...
                         where's the comm. center?

                                   CANTON
                         We should get off as soon as
                         possible.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         But if we can at least send a
                         message...

                                   CANTON
                         I say we evacuate as soon as...

                                   FINNEGAN
                             (to Canton)
                         Who are you?

                                   CAPTAIN
                         He's the owner...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Why don't you want a message sent?

                                   CANTON
                         I just think that...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Because you know a message can't be
                         sent...

               There is a moment of silence.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         You're the inside guy aren't you?
                         The guy who knocked out the
                         communications.

               Hanover sets Mason's pulse-rifle down and claps his hands.

                                   HANOVER
                         Bravo.

               Canton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused.
               Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS
               him against the hull.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How the hell do we fix it?!

               A tense moment as Canton debates his situation, then relents.

                                   CANTON
                         You can't... All the systems were
                         melted at their core by nitric
                         acid...

                                   CAPTAIN
                             (confused)
                         This was your life's work...your
                         dreams...

                                   CANTON
                         My dreams cost more than they would
                         make...I miscalculated the
                         market... there was no way I could
                         recoup...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Unless you collected on the
                         insurance...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What are you people talking about?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         He's with them. 

               He motions to the mercenaries.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         They rob the joint blind and
                         torpedo it to the bottom. He
                         collects the insurance, and sails
                         off into the sunset clean as a
                         whistle.

               Finnegan fixes Hanover with a look of certainty.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Right?

               The Captain blows. He leaps on Canton. His hands find the
               older man's throat.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         All these people dead!! Because you
                         screwed up on the math?? 

               Finnegan pulls the Captain off.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         It's not going to help us!

                                   CAPTAIN
                         We're going to die here! We're
                         going to die!

               Finnegan holds the Captain with both hands, calming him.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I was born in a City housing
                         project in the Bronx OK? It's not
                         in the cards that I die on a luxury
                         cruise ship...now which way up?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (alarmed)
                         You hear that?

               Unseen by anyone, there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY. The
               walls start to come alive with dark, SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS.
               HIDDEN within the maze of machinery, OBSCURED by the bad
               lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm
               through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes.
               The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         They are...they are everywhere.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         All right, be cool, everybody, nice
                         and slow, no sudden moves.

               Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. Then a
               loud GURGLING is HEARD. Everybody looks up at the ceiling. 

               Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large
               translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside
               it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING
               suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and
               LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty
               intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly. EVERYBODY
               freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch. Finnegan and Hanover
               OPEN FIRE. Covering their asses.

                                                       CUT TO:

        89     ENGINE CHAMBERS - NIGHT                                 89

               Everybody pours out of the machine shop and fans out into
               this mechanical MAZE. The engine chambers are a labyrinth of
               pipe-lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks
               and pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark.

               Hanover, Pantucci, Chin and Mamooli OPEN UP. FIRING blindly
               and wildly at anything and everything that seems to move in
               the darkness. The MUZZLE FLASHES and TRACER FIRE light up the
               chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau. We catch more
               ABSTRACT GLIMPSES of the translucent TENTACLE-SACS, strange
               FEELERS, groping SUCKERS, SLIME and VEINS.

                                                       CUT TO:

        90     DEEP IN MAZE - NIGHT                                    90

               Finnegan rounds a corner and crouch-runs down a narrow alley.
               Alone now. White-knuckling his rifle. He turns another corner
               and runs right into Trillian.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         AHHH!!

               ...Spins, gun ready to fire at...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Noooo!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Jesus Christ lady...

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (scared)
                         What are those things?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't know...

               Finnegan looks around to the engine room, a labyrinth of pipe
               lined alleyways, motorized chambers, swaying catwalks and
               pillars of steel. The LIGHTING is very poor, very dark. He
               takes off.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         ...there's got to be a way to
                         access out back there... 

               He motions into the deep shadows.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         But what makes you think there
                         aren't more of hose...things...back
                         there?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Nothing...you want to come, come...
                         you don't...

               Trillian weighs her options, and takes off after Finnegan.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You don't have to be so touchy.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Look lady, I know you people are
                         used to getting your way...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What's that supposed to mean? You
                         people.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You people...rich people...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I'm not rich people.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Well, you sure do a good imitation.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Thank you, I work at it...

               Finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk. He
               starts to climb. Trillian, hampered by her long slinky dress,
               rips at the bottom, making it maxi to mini in a flash, and
               scoots after Finnegan.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         I heard you say you grew up in the
                         projects in the Bronx...

               Reaching the top of the ladder, she clambers onto the catwalk
               next to Finnegan, who is deciding which way to go.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Trillian Daley... 

               She holds out her hand.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Projects...South Chicago. 

               Finnegan ignores her hand.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Finnegan...John J...now that we've
                         been properly introduced, can we
                         get the hell out of here?

               Finnegan starts to walk down the catwalk.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         So this boat of yours...that's what
                         you do? Give people...rides.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         That's what I do.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Seen a lot of islands?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Quite a few.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Since I'm a kid, I had this
                         dream... I want to own my own
                         tropical island...
                         Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food,
                         little clothes...population of
                         one...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Anti social?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Self sufficient...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         With the emphasis on SELF, and in
                         selfish, right?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Takes one to know one.

               SNAP!! A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian.
               Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. 

               Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed.
               Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt.
               Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- 

               The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach.
               Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place.
               Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees
               -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up
               and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling
               their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to
               Finnegan. 

               Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's
               feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen
               in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her.
               Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall.
               FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES
               against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. 

               A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He
               leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle,
               turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to
               run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap
               onto his arm. HE YELLS. 

               The Creature starts reeling him in. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She
               stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. 

               ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being
               reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle.
               When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running
               back. Panting hard, she aims the gun.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Shoot it! Shoot it!

               Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the
               tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         The safety! The safety!

               Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right
               lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to
               find it.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I don't know where it is!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         On the side!!

               Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best
               thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS
               the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink
               blood, releases Finnegan and recoils.

               Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The
               tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again.
               Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to
               his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle
               coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan
               grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and
               fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Let's get the hell out of here!

               Finnegan staggers to his feet. He and Trillian run off.

                                                       CUT TO:

        91     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     91

               Trillian and Finnegan come running around a corner, and stop
               to catch their breath.

                                   FINNEGAN
                             (annoyed)
                         The safety...the safety... He
                         flicks the safety on and off.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Got it?

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (pissed)
                         Hey! I didn't have to come back.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Yeah you did...

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (defensive)
                         Right... You have a boat.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Boat or no boat... You woulda come
                         back anyway. You're that kind of
                         gal.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Oh yeah? What kind is that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The "come back" kind.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How do you know that?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Takes one to know one.

               Finnegan's small smile makes Trillian acutely uncomfortable.

                                   V.O.
                         HEELLPP!!

                                                       CUT TO:

        92     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     92

               The Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web.
               Struggling, frantic. But the more he struggles, the more
               enmeshed he gets. He holds his hands out beseechingly to
               Canton, who stands looking at him in terror.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         Help me!

               But Canton does not move. All of a sudden Canton sees
               something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes
               his blood freeze.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What is it?

               Canton takes a few steps back.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         What?!... WHAT?!

               The Captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it
               is. There is a DARK MOVEMENT deep within the spider web.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         HELP ME, CANTON! HELP MEEEEEEE!!

               ANGLE ON: Finnegan and Trillian racing across a catwalk.
               Below them, they can see Canton backing away from the
               Captain.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Grab his hands!!

               Canton looks up, stunned, as he sees Finnegan and Trillian
               rushing down from the catwalk.

                                   CAPTAIN
                         CANTON!! HELP!!

               Canton backs away from the Captain, as the Captain's struggle
               draws him further into the web. The Captain's eyes bulge,
               horrified, as he feels SOMETHING inside the spider web GRAB
               him from behind.

                                   CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                         IT HURTS!!!!! IT
                         HURRRRRTTTTTSSSS!!!

               He struggles WILDLY. Then starts to freeze up as the
               tentacles wrap around him. 

               Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is
               slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body
               bady constricting, paralyzed. His VOICE is CHOKED OFF.

               Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another
               alleyway. Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his
               FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web. They skid to a stop.
               Everybody piles up. Eyes wide. Watching as the Captain's body
               is pulled deeper into the dark web. Tentacles enveloping him.

                                   HANOVER
                             (to Canton)
                         Where is the closest hatch?

               Canton still pressed against the wall, staring at the spot
               the Captain disappeared, talking to himself.

                                   CANTON
                         I never meant for anyone to get
                         hurt ...it was supposed to be
                         clean...

               Hanover grabs Canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo
               jacket.

                                   HANOVER
                         You hypocritical bastard...all you
                         gave a shit about was the money...
                         where's the hatch!!

               Canton points down a darkened passageway.

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                         Alright let's move out...you two on
                         point...

               He looks at an uneasy Mamooli and Chin.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey... Which way's aft?

                                   PANTUCCI
                         That way.

               He points in the opposite direction.

                                   HANOVER
                         Who gives a shit about aft?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         That's where my boat's moored.

                                   HANOVER
                         You trying to take over my show
                         Finnegan, that what you trying to
                         do?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Just trying to get to my boat...

               Finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction
               that disappears in the dark. Pantucci is right with him.
               Trillian, a step behind.

                                   HANOVER
                             (yelling)
                         You stay away from that vault! You
                         hear me?

               Just before he steps into the darkness, Finnegan calls over
               his shoulder...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         They respond to sound...

               He disappears into the dark. Canton looks at Hanover for a
               long moment, and then takes off after Finnegan. The other two
               mercs look at Hanover, wavering.

                                   HANOVER
                             (tense)
                         What?

               The sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around
               nervously.

                                   MAMOOLI
                             (whispered)
                         He made sense.

                                   HANOVER
                             (loud)
                         He's a bloody...

               And then conscious of his voice reverberating...

                                   HANOVER (CONT'D)
                             (whispered)
                         ...he's a bloody taxi driver!

               Chin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after Finnegan. Hanover
               stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming. After a long
               moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well.

                                                       CUT TO:

        93     BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY                                93

               In SLOW-MO, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened,
               pipe-lined passageway. Guns out front. Sight beams sweeping
               the path ahead. Eyes wide open. Sweat sliding down their
               faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding
               out of chests. 

               The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension. 

               Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking
               reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan
               continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes
               nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air. 

               LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian
               and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark
               foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They
               come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan
               turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head.
               He has none.

                                   HANOVER
                             (whispered)
                         Very good Finnegan...very good.

               Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and
               pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat
               mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times,
               and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan
               looks at her curiously, but with respect.

                                                       CUT TO:

        94     BALLAST SECTION - DAY                                   94

               They ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are
               indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND.
               Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some
               STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single
               violently twisted HATCH DOOR. 

               Finnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give. 

               Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle
               to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton,
               who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well
               at all.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         What's on the far side?

                                   CANTON
                         I don't know.

                                   PANTUCCI
                             (nerves)
                         It's your damn ship! What the hell
                         do you mean you don't know?

               Finnegan touches Pantucci's shoulder.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey, what difference does it
                         make...

               Finnegan enters the water.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         If you hear one shot, you know I
                         made it...start coming...

               Pantucci follows Finnegan to the water.

                                   HANOVER
                         How do we know you're going to
                         signal...how do we know you're not
                         going to just take off? 

               Finnegan stops.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'll wait here... You go check it
                         out.

               Hanover does not move.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                             (contemptuous)
                         I didn't think so.

               Finnegan wades into the water. Just before he sinks beneath
               the surface...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Finnegan...

               He looks back.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Be careful.

               With a smile, Finnegan dives under. Pantucci right behind
               him. The others stand looking around, nervous.

                                                       CUT TO:

        95     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                      95

               Finnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast. Then into a
               passageway lined with black pipes. Pantucci right behind him.
               STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters. 

               CREAKS and MOANS. Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they
               swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts.
               The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift
               up from the darkness below. 

               The MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind.
               He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM!
               AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers
               on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. He fights his way
               past and swims off in a panic.

                                                       CUT TO:

        96     BALLAST - NIGHT                                         96

               Trillian stares down into the water. Hanover keeps a sharp,
               nervous eye back down the catwalk, white-knuckling his pulse
               rifle. Chin and Mamooli keep watch, tight lipped. Canton
               paces back and forth, driven by anxiety.

                                   HANOVER
                         Stop pacing.

               Canton acts as if he does not hear. He keeps pacing. Hanover
               chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into Canton's arm.
               Canton crumbles against the railing, in pain.

                                   CANTON
                         AAAAHHHH!!!!

                                   HANOVER
                         You deaf?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Why don't you back off?

                                   HANOVER
                         You want some too?

               Hanover's jaw clenches. He releases the safety on his rifle,
               the click resounding ominously in the hollow room.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How brave we are.

               Trillian's eyes fix on Hanover's, unwavering. A Mexican
               standoff.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         Hanover!

               Everyone turn to... A giant ball of black, wet, OOZING RUBBER
               UNDULATES down the gangway. Coming straight at them. A mass
               of glistening striated MUSCLE.

                                   HANOVER
                         Fire!!

               The three men open up with their pulse rifles. The CREATURE
               gets RIPPED TO SHREDS. Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS
               everywhere. But onward it comes. Down the gangway. 

               Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens
               fire. Canton jumps into the water and disappears.

                                                       CUT TO:

        97     KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         97

               Finnegan explodes to the surface. GASPING for air. He reaches
               down and yanks a half drowned Pantucci up next to him. They
               both look up to gunfire exploding in the distance.

                                                       CUT TO:

               The creature keeps coming. The mercs keep firing. Then
               without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the
               water, disappearing beneath the surface. 

               Trillian is astounded. She throws down her pistol, picks up
               the pulse rifle, and slams on the trigger. The recoil of the
               rifle throws her into the water. When she surfaces, she sees
               Chin and Mamooli, firing as they retreat to the water's edge.
               Still holding her rifle, she dives.

               Trillian swims down a violently SHAKING PASSAGEWAY. Eyes
               wide. Filled with fear. All around, DEBRIS DROPS through the
               water. Primordial SOUNDS REVERBERATE off the walls. Lots of
               BUBBLING and GURGLING -- THEN SOMETHING LUNGES OUT! 

               TRILLIAN OPENS UP. FIRING wildly. The water fills with FIRE
               and BUBBLES. Trillian looks around. Scared shitless. The
               bubbles clear just in time for her to see -- Chin, mouth
               open, eyes wide, screaming in agony, being ripped past her.
               She tries to fire her rifle. Too late. Trillian watches as
               Chin VANISHES down the shaft in a CLOUD OF BUBBLES.

                                                       CUT TO:

               TRILLIAN BURSTS to the surface. FINNEGAN YANKS her up and out
               of the water.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You O.K.?

               Trillian can only nod, and gasp for breath. Canton and
               Hanover catch their breath, PANTING AWAY, waterlogged.
               Hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in Trillian's
               hand. Trillian points the barrel at him, and hits the safety.

               Mamooli bursts out of the water, falling on the floor, close
               to panic mode.

               Finnegan TOPPLES a large, heavy metal BROILER onto the open
               floor gate, sealing the watery hole in the floor. There are
               two hatches in this room. The far hatch is closed. Mamooli
               stands next to an OPEN HATCH. Canton points to it.

                                   CANTON
                         Through there...another sixty,
                         seventy yards...there are more
                         elevators there.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         I ain't goin' up no more elevators.

                                   CANTON
                         There's stairways...

               Mamooli SLAMS the HATCH SHUT. Eyes bugging out of his head.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         I say we stay right here!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Are you crazy?

                                   MAMOOLI
                             (desperate)
                         There's plenty of food here. We can
                         hold out...someone'll rescue us...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Who?

                                   MAMOOLI
                         Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         On what? This son of a bitch
                             (to Canton)
                         zapped the communications.

                                   HANOVER
                         Mamooli stand down!

                                   MAMOOLI
                         We don't even know if his boat is
                         still there...you saw Billy!

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Boat or no boat...I'm going...

               Finnegan steps forward. Mamooli aims his rifle right at
               Finnegan's head.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         They're wipin' us out one at a
                         time. I say we make a stand. Right
                         here! Right now! Maximum firepower!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Somebody shoot this jerk!

                                   FINNEGAN
                             (calm)
                         Nobody's shooting nobody...come on,
                         just let us through the hatch!

                                   MAMOOLI
                         I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill
                         you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm
                         not playin' around here!

               Finnegan freezes. CLOSE ON: The hatch. As a BLACK LIQUID
               starts to OOZE through a tiny latch-hole. No one sees it.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I once saw a guy put a fish in a
                         bottle, then he corked it, sealing
                         it tight, and threw it to a baby
                         octopus. The little sucker felt its
                         way around that bottle, and in less
                         than two minutes, got that cork
                         off, slid inside, and ate that
                         fish.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         What the hell are you talking
                         about?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Us...I'm talking about us... We're
                         the fish.

               The LIQUID SHADOW OOZES down and hits the floor, starts to
               EXPAND, filling like a water balloon. It's not a liquid. It's
               a Tentacle. VEINS, FEELERS and SUCKERS begin to form.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         And what? These things are
                         octopuses

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't know what these things are
                         ...all I know is...

               The TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli. Inches
               behind his head. Finnegan and Hanover see it. Eyes widening.

                                   MAMOOLI
                         What...? What??

               Mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to
               strike.

                                   MAMOOLI (CONT'D)
                         EEEEYYYYYAAAAHHHH!!!!

               He opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The
               tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The
               room is empty. He runs out.

                                                       CUT TO:

       101     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     101

               Mamooli rushes into the empty passageway, looks left. Then
               right. His POV. Down the hall another TENTACLE comes racing
               at him. Mamooli panics, drops his rifle. 

               TRACK WITH Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his
               shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after
               him...gaining...gaining... almost on him... Mamooli leaps
               through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift
               motion. The tentacle slams into the glass portal. Stopped.
               Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps.
               He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns... WHAM!!!
               Another tentacle envelops his face!

                                   MAMOOLI
                         EEEYYYAAAHHHH!!!!!

                                                       CUT TO:

       102     MECHANICAL CHAMBER - NIGHT                             102

               Dante's Inferno: STEAM, SMOKE, FIRE, STRANGE NOISES, DARK
               AREAS, and lots of MOVING ENGINE PARTS. 

               Finnegan leads, followed by Trillian, Hanover, Pantucci, and
               Canton. We can HEAR their HEARTS BEATING. Scary shit.
               Finnegan heads for a open HATCH. It suddenly SLAMS SHUT. He
               instantly VEERS down another passageway.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         What the hell is going on!!

               Finnegan heads for another open HATCHWAY. It also SLAMS SHUT.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         They're herding us. 

               Finnegan and company keep going.

                                   HANOVER
                         What are you talking about?

               As they round a corner, the CEILING IMPLODES right in front
               of them. PIPES and OTHER MATTER CRASH down. Cutting them off.
               Leaving only one route open...a slim passageway.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Like cattle...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You're saying they can think?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I'm saying they're calling the
                         shots...

               Finnegan heads toward the passageway.

                                   CANTON
                         Do we have to go there?

               The ceiling left above them begins to torque, and splits. The
               answer is plain. Everyone runs into the passage just as the
               ceiling comes down.

                                                       CUT TO:

       103     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     103

               Finnegan leads them single-file, they quickly head into a
               SHAKING narrow void. Fear has led to silence, and unbearable
               tension. The walls on either side creak, and moan with
               strange noises.

                                                       CUT TO:

       104     MID-HULL - NIGHT                                       104

               Finnegan quickly comes out of the CREAKING, MOANING GANGWAY,
               followed by the others. All the STRANGE NOISES suddenly STOP.
               Everything gets quiet. Finnegan freezes. Something's wrong.
               Everybody looks around. STEAM SHOOTS OUT from multiple pipes.
               The air is thick with MIST.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What's the matter?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         The quiet...

                                   HANOVER
                         Maybe we lost them.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Or maybe we're exactly where they
                         want us to be.

               Finnegan moves on. The others follow. Guns out front. TENSE.
               They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a
               soul-wrenching nightmare. The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH.

               Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge
               GELATINOUS WOMB. Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow
               JELL-O, with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it.
               If it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered
               beautiful. Inside the womb, A DOZEN HUMANS, passengers, float
               around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living
               dead. They all seem to be breathing the gelatin. Several
               TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re
               forms in some sort of strange mitosis. 

               Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified.
               But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at
               them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as
               their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. Trillian looks
               sick, trembles in fear.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         What is it?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         A meat locker.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         We can't just leave them here.

               Canton looks like he's about to throw up, he starts backing
               away, heading for a side hatch.

                                   CANTON
                         I can.

               In the womb, a Tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young
               LADY. The Lady tries to back-pedal away, but because of the
               gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only
               move in slow motion. The FEELERS GRIP her naked thigh. She
               tries to scream, but her face is already starting to
               constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed. Pantucci is so
               horrified he's about to cry.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Oh no...oh God please no.

               The TENTACLE-SAC gloms onto the Lady's forehead. THROUGH THE
               SAC we can SEE her SKIN MELTING. The only thing she can move
               are her EYES, which are bugging-out in absolute horror as she
               is imbibed alive. Our heroes are frozen in fear. Until the
               Lady's EYES LIQUEFY. 

               Trillian burries her head in Finnegan's shoulder, trying to
               shut out the horror.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         We can't do anything for them...
                         Let's go...

               He begins to lead her toward the hatch...when her eyes
               recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair. The old
               lady seems to see her too. Her hands read out, IMPLORING. Her
               mouth silently shapes the words: HELP ME! Just as a tentacle
               comes creeping toward her.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         NOOO!!

               Her rage rises. She hefts her rifle, and starts blasting
               away.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         You won't get her!! You won't!!

               Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE. The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin.
               BLASTING IT AWAY. But the bullets only manage to go about
               twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop.
               GELATIN EXPLODES all over the place. TRACER HOLES STREAK
               through the stuff. But all the bullets are sliding short.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         Finnegan...do something!! Please!!

               Finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling
               where most of the Tentacles are coming from. Their long TAILS
               WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes. A bas-relief of
               horror. Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades
               off Hanover's utility belt.

                                   HANOVER
                         Finnegan, No!!!

               ...bites the pins and spits them out.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Eat this.

               He chucks the grenades up into the strange WRITHING FRESCO,
               safely clear of the passengers.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         FIRE IN THE HOLE!

               Pantucci and Hanover throw themselves to the floor. Finnegan
               pulls Trillian down, covering her.

               BA-WOOM! GELATIN SPRAYS EVERYWHERE.

                                                       CUT TO:

       105     FUJI MARU - SAME TIME                                  105

               A loud, creepy, suction-like SOUND is HEARD, that strange
               pitter- patter of little feet running across the hull. Then
               the HULL begins to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.

               All the MOVEMENT STOPS. The remaining TENTACLES VANISH into
               the machinery. Pantucci, and Hanover look up from the floor,
               covered in slime. Finnegan and Trillian also look up...and
               then look at each other face to face...inches apart. Dripping
               with slime.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Looking good...

                         You should talk...

               Then the machinery shuts down. The engines go dead. ALL SOUND
               CUTS OUT. An expectant hush. Somewhere, WATER DRIPS... 

               WE GO EXTREMELY CLOSE ON Trillian's EYES. Pantucci's EYES.
               Hanover's EYES. Finnegan's EYES. The air is riddled with
               ominous expectation. And that's when the HULL BEGINS TO
               TORQUE. RIVETS POP and SNAP. WATER SPRAYS. METAL BUCKLES.

       107     SHOT:                                                  107

               At the far end of the ship, part of the LOWER BOW RIPS OPEN!
               AND A WALL OF WATER RUSHES IN. FLOOD CITY! Finnegan's eyes
               widen as he sees (MODEL SHOT) the massive WAVE OF WATER
               CRASHING TOWARDS THEM. RIPPING OUT PIPES, DUCTS, WALLS,
               EQUIPMENT and EVERYTHING in front of it.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         GO! GO! GO!

               They all hightail it for hatches. Finnegan and Trillian make
               it into one hatch. Hanover and Pantucci make it into another.
               WATER CRASHES and SPRAYS behind them.

               WATER BLASTS through a hatch and CHASES Finnegan and Trillian
               down a passageway. They jag left at an intersection -- WATER
               BLASTS through the hatch directly in front of them.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         We're going to sink! We've got to
                         get on deck!

               They backtrack. Trillian's now in the lead. They HAUL ASS
               down a hallway. WATER ROARING IN from everywhere behind them.
               All of the watertight HATCHES begin to hydraulically CLOSE.
               Trillian and Finnegan JAG into a hatch. It's a small room.
               The hatch in front of them closes. WATER BLASTS in behind
               them. SWEEPS them off their feet. The ROOM quickly starts to
               FILL UP. Trillian pulls frantically at the hatch.

               Hanover and Pantucci quickly slog their way through knee-high
               water. Pantucci stumbles into the water, frantically
               scrambles up. He looks back -- UNDER THE WATER, INKY FORMS
               hurl themselves down the passageway right towards him.
               Pantucci YELPS, and splashes away.

               Trillian and Finnegan pull with all their might on a tiny
               portal. Finnegan tries to insert the blade of his knife in
               the crack.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         So how do you get from the Bronx to
                         the South China sea?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You quit high school, lie about
                         your age, join the navy, and next
                         thing you know, four years are up
                         and you need a way to make a
                         living...

               The knife blade slips into the crack.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         I'll break the seal! Pull.

               He yanks the blade. Trillian pulls. The seal pops. The portal
               flies open. Waist-high in water, Trillian sticks her arm out,
               tries to get her shoulder out, but there's no chance in hell
               of that.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Too small!

               She pulls her arm out. And a TENTACLE LUNGES IN. Just missing
               Trillian. It SPLASHES under the water. GRABS Finnegan's
               ankle. Pulls him under. FINNEGAN sticks the barrel of his gun
               underwater and OPENS FIRE. WATER EXPLODES. The Tentacle
               recoils. And rips itself back out the porthole. Trillian
               SLAMS the PORTHOLE SHUT and dogs it tight. The

               WATER QUICKLY RISES.

               Pantucci and Hanover hauling ass. Hanover pulls out his last
               two Thermite grenades. Pantucci panics and grabs for them.

                         Gimme one! Gimme one!

               He knocks both of them out of Hanover's hands. They DISAPPEAR
               under the water.

                                   HANOVER
                         You idiot!

               They quickly fumble around in the water, trying to find them.
               A TENTACLE BLASTS around the corner. Partially obscured by
               the wave in front of it. Heading right for them. Hanover
               finds the two grenades. Gives one to Pantucci. They rip the
               pins out and toss the grenades behind them.
               Then HAUL ASS faster. The Tentacle right behind them. A BEAT.
               And then the GRENADES EXPLODE, BA-WOOM! BA-WOOM!

               SLICKED DECK just in time to see -- A HOLE BEING BLOWN OUT
               the side of the Fuji Maru's HULL. BUBBLES continue to EXPLODE
               OUT from under the bow.

                         Oh my God, it's going to sink.

               Then slowly, Canton gets a gleam in his eye, now thrilled.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         It's going to sink.

               Finnegan and Trillian are getting banged around the frothy
               WATER as it quickly RISES. Now only inches from the ceiling.
               Trapped. They're about to drown. Finnegan keeps looking
               around, trying to figure a way out.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I was so goddamn close, Finnegan!

                         Keep tasting...

               Finnegan shoves the pulse rifle to the ceiling. And blasts
               away until part of the ceiling falls out and into the water.
               There's just enough room between two metal beams to get out.
               The rising WATER SHOVES them up through the hole.

               Side-by-side, Hanover and Pantucci quickly slog their way
               through waist-high water. They round a corner and look back --
               INKY FORMS SLOSH around the corner. Heading right for them.
               They slog faster.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         They're catchin' up! They're

                         Feed them. That'll slow them down.

               A black STRIATED MUSCLE ROILS out of the foamy water, then
               quickly VANISHES under it, heading straight for them.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Feed 'em?!! Okay! All right! Feed
                         'em what? WHAT ARE WE GONNA FEED

               'EM?! Hanover takes his pistol and SHOOTS Pantucci in the
               leg, BLAM! Pantucci SCREAMS. FALLS into the water. 

               Hanover RUNS on. 

               Pantucci doesn't even have time to deal with the pain. He
               starts SCRAMBLING through the water. UNDERWATER, the INKY
               FORMS RACE AFTER HIM. Only meters away. Pantucci throws
               himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter. SLAMS the DOOR
               SHUT. The TENTACLE ATTACKS the door. WORMING its way across
               the surface, trying to find a way inside. Pantucci is scared
               beyond his pain. Pushing back as far as he can against the
               rear wall, he sees the control button. He presses the up
               arrow. The dumbwaiter starts to move.

               The Saipan is still bobbing behind the Fuji Maru. But the
               HARPOON HOOK, which holds the tow-line and is embedded into
               the rear deck of the ship, is starting to PRY LOOSE. It JERKS
               and BUCKS against the metal wall. Canton doesn't notice this
               as he slips and slides his way up to the railing. He sees the
               Saipan and smiles. Then he looks off at --

               rising out of the ocean. About a mile away. Canton starts to
               climb over the railing. And that's when the HARPOON HOOK RIPS
               FREE. WHIZZES FORWARD. And IMPALES Canton's LEG. He SCREAMS.
               Tries to spin free. The hook hangs onto his leg for a long,
               agonizing BEAT as Canton continues to SCREAM. Then the HOOK
               RIPS FREE, grabs the METAL RAILING and starts TEARING IT off
               the deck. Canton drops to the deck, holding his leg and
               whimpering in pain. And then he sees it --

               In the dark, Trillian trips. She falls to the slippery,

                                   HANOVER (V.O.)
                         Help!! Help!! 

               Pantucci limps around the bar, down a row of one armed
               bandits... rounds a corner, comes face-to-face with Hanover.

               Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair. His face
               is badly constricted. His body paralyzed. He clings to a
               black-jack table as a Tentacle-Sac drinks its way up his leg.
               It's already to his hip. He grasps desperately for his
               pistol, just beyond his reach on the floor. This guy ain't
               gonna survive. 

               PANTUCCI YELPS and quickly back away, eyes wide, totally
               tense. He looks around, sees that there's only one Tentacle,
               and it's completely occupied with devouring Hanover. Pantucci
               is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover. Then he
               looks at the Sac, filled with regurgitated flesh.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         ...even you don't deserve this.

               Pantucci picks up Hanover's pistol. Then slowly, cautiously,
               he creeps forward, and sticks the gun into Hanover's
               TWITCHING HAND.

                                   PANTUCCI (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry man...

               He turns and quickly limps off. Hanover's EYES look down at
               the gun in his hand. Then, with all the strength he has left,
               he slowly, painfully, turns the pistol so it points at his
               head. 

               CLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes
               the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself.
               He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun
               is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream.

                                                       CUT TO:

       124     REAR DECK - SAME TIME                                  124

               Finnegan and Trillian race out onto the rear deck just as the
               HARPOON HOOK finishes TEARING the railing off the ship. The
               HOOK, the TOW- LINE, and the ENTIRE RAILING DROP over the
               side and fall OUT OF SIGHT. The TWO BOATS are now UNCOUPLED.
               Finnegan reels at the rain soaked sky.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Will somebody give me a break here?

               And that's when Finnegan and Trillian hear the SOUND of a
               HYDRAULIC HOIST. They look over --

       125     AT THE WATERSPORTS PLATFORM:                           125

               The speedboat is being hydraulically lowered into the water.
               Canton sits inside, fiddling with the ignition. ANGLE ON:
               Trillian and Finnegan racing down the spiral stairs leading
               to the watersports platform.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Wait! Stop!

               The boat touches down into the water.

                                   CANTON
                         I'd like to but I have an
                         appointment with my insurance
                         broker!

               He HITS the HOIST-RELEASE BUTTON. The speedboat breaks free.
               Canton HITS the IGNITION. The boat's ENGINE ROARS.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         Life takes the damndest turns,
                         doesn't it?

               He red-lines the THROTTLE. The SPEEDBOAT HAULS ASS away from
               the cruiseliner. Canton steers for the island. Smiling. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian

               IN HER RAGE...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You son of a bitch!!

               She grabs Finnegan's pulse rifle, hefts it to her shoulder...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Look!

               He forces her to look in the distance. Their POV. The island.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do
                         it? How do we get there?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not like him.

               Finnegan points to the water...and an INKY PSEUDOPOD FORM
               racing after the speedboat underwater.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         It's the engine...it can hear the
                         engine...it goes for the loudest
                         sound...

               The Tentacle quickly picks up speed, going faster and faster,
               getting closer and closer, stretching further and further.
               Suddenly, behind them, a METALLIC THRASHING SOUND is HEARD.
               They turn around and look -- The hook, the tow-line, and the
               entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports
               platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis, trying
               to tear free -- The Saipan is still clinging by its
               fingernails to the Fuji Maru! Finnegan races over to a WINCH
               and grabs the winch- line.

                                                       CUT TO:

       126     SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT                                      126

               Canton, smiling brightly, peers at the approaching island
               through the speedboat's windscreen. So relieved he sings to
               himself, from the operetta H.M.S. PINAFORE.

                                   CANTON
                         Oh we sail the ocean blue, and our
                         mighty ship's a beauty. We are
                         strong men, yes it's true, and
                         responsive to our duty...

               When...YANK!!...the SPEEDBOAT is GRABBED from below,
               practically exploding as it DISINTEGRATES into TWO PIECES.
               Canton is PROPELLED through the windscreen and onto the hood.

                                                       CUT TO:

       127     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            127

               Finnegan struggles to clip the winch-line onto the tow-line,
               hanging precariously over the edge of the ship, clip in one
               hand, winch-line in the other. The whole METAL MESS is
               BUCKING and TWISTING and SCREECHING. His every joint is being
               ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the
               line before the entire rig tears away into the sea. 

               With one last heroic effort of will and grit, he snaps the
               clip in place just as it all BREAKS LOOSE. One of the JET
               SKIS and the ENTIRE RAILING are RIPPED over the side and fall
               down into the ocean. Finnegan is also YANKED over the side,
               but he manages to hold on by his fingers, dangling
               precariously.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Hit it! Hit it!

               The HOOK and the TOW-LINE drop -- then SNAP TAUGHT as the
               winch-line holds them tight.

               Trillian throws the start lever on the winch. The WINCH KICKS
               ON and starts reeling in the Saipan. Finnegan tries to crawl
               up on the deck, exhausted. Trillian reaches down and pulls
               him the rest of the way up. He half collapses on top of her.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         You know, Finnegan, I'm starting to
                         believe what you said about you not
                         being born to die on a luxury
                         liner.

               Despite the grimness of their position, the closeness of
               their bodies is...a turn on...to both of them...and then a
               SCREAM from the sea. They look in the direction of...

                                                       CUT TO:

       128     SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT                                      128

               Canton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face
               shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked
               eyes watch a TENTACLE slowly squirm across the hood toward
               him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. Canton backs away
               from it as far as he can.

               Another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up next to him. Canton crawls away
               from that one. Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping
               mucus. Canton's eyes widen, horrified. Then another TENTACLE
               SQUIRMS up. Canton crawls to the center of the hood. And
               another TENTACLE. Canton has nowhere to go. The Tentacles
               close in on him.

                                   CANTON
                         No! No! No!

               All the tentacles rise over him, about to descend.

                                   CANTON (CONT'D)
                         NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

       129     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      129

               Finnegan and Trillian race for all they are worth, clamber
               over the side of the Fuji Maru, dropping to the deck of the
               Saipan.

                                                       CUT TO:

       130     SAIPAN - NIGHT                                         130

               Finnegan and Trillian slowly clamber through the hold, waist
               deep in water, on edge, eyes wide, watching for any sign of
               trouble. It's quiet in here. Maybe too quiet.

                                   TRILLIAN
                             (quietly)
                         Finnegan...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Yeah...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         ...the minute you start your
                         engines ...it's going to kill us,
                         isn't it?

               They step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts
               SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST
               OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is
               stunned.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not unless we kill it first.

               Finnegan SMASHES more of the CRATE, it falls apart, REVEALING
               the entire torpedo. He hands her his pulse rifle.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Anything moves, you shoot.

               Finnegan starts to yank open the top plates of the missile
               head. Trillian looks around nervously.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         There's not much horsepower left in
                         the engines, but there's enough
                         noise...once this baby's set...I'll
                         rev it up...that slimy bastard will
                         come for it like candy...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         If you blow up your boat, how are
                         we going to get to the island?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Jet ski...there's one left up
                         there.

               The plate comes loose. Revealing a gaggle of wires, and
               parts.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         ...let's see, it was red wire cross
                         compressor blue wire...or blue
                         cross red?

               He starts to fiddle with the wires. -- Suddenly, there's a
               LOUD SLOSHING SOUND right behind them! CRATES TOPPLE! More
               pulse rifles spill out. Trillian spins, ready to blast away
               with the pulse rifle, to...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!

                         it's red to blue or blue to red... 

               He refers to the wires.

                         Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see
                         you? Joey, what happened to your

                         Joey, you want to get sucked out by
                         a giant fucking mutated squid?

                         Squid...squid like...squid type...
                         it's got tentacles, a feed sac...

                         processor somewhere...what the hell
                         do I know is going on deep down in

                         shit we've never seen...eighty foot
                         clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just
                         guessing...can you get me more
                         juice out of Hercules...fast?

                         For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's
                         not fast.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         How about noise? Can you get noise?
                         We don't need speed, just noise,
                         right?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Right...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Can somebody tell me what the
                         object of the exercise is here?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Seafood salad.
                             (to Trillian)
                         You ever operate a jet ski?

                         You want ME to go up there?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Not unless you can wire a missile
                         or fix an engine.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         And what if I run into one of those
                         things?

               Finnegan tosses her a pulse rifle from the overturned crate.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Don't forget the safety.

               She hits the safety, slams a shell into chamber...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Don't take too long...I'm not
                         planning on being on the menu
                         tonight.

               ...and exits.

                             (razzing)
                         I've never seen you so congenial
                         with a member of the opposite
                         sex... The two of you got a nice
                         patter going...got a nice
                         rapport...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         And you got 10 minutes before this
                         thing livens up a boring evening.

               Finnegan attaches a wire to a sprocket. A red light starts to
               blink on the warhead.

               It is VERY DARK. The RAIN is getting worse. THUNDER RUMBLES.
               LIGHTNING FLASHES. The FUJI MARU MOANS and CREAKS.
               BUBBLES EXPLODE from beneath it. The Saipan rocks against her
               hull. Trillian clambers along the TILTING RAILING, heading
               for the watersports platform. Her gorgeous eyes shift
               nervously.

                                   TRILLIAN

               OK... The ship's METAL HULL SCREECHES. The SEAWATER BUBBLES
               and GURGLES. From somewhere deep inside the ship, we HEAR
               that loud primordial YOWL again. Trillian freezes, her heart
               double beats. She looks around, really scared.

               The missile is on a hoist being pushed forward by Pantucci
               and Finnegan toward a GAPING HOLE in the PORT BOW.

                                   PANTUCCI
                         You know what I think? I think our

               The missile head is right in line with the hole in the bow.

                         How does an island sound to you?

               Pantucci looks at Finnegan quizically. This is news to him.

               The TIP of the WARHEAD creeps out through the hole. The body
               of the missile is just a hair too wide, which is good,
               because it jams itself nice and tight into the hole.

               swivel arm that holds it out over the railing. The PLATFORM
               TILTS! Trillian loses her balance. Almost goes over the side.
               Just barely manages to catch herself. Hangs there for a
               moment. Something SWISHES in the water below her. Trillian's
               EYES scan the darkness; scared sick.

               Finnegan LASHES the STEERING-STICKS as hard left as they'll
               go. The rudder locks tight. Pantucci enters.

                         won't go fast but it'll go loud...

               Trillian's scream tears through the night. Finnegan's eyes go
               to the Fuji Maru. He kicks open a box by the side of the
               console, and pulls out a sawed off shot gun with a pistol
               handle in a holster.

               Finnegan hefts a pulse rifle, and runs out of the pilothouse.

               leveled. Adrenaline rushing through his veins. A man on a

               CREAKING. Trillian's scream pierces the night, followed by
               several shots. Finnegan takes off in it's direction.

               Trillian is being dragged down the dark hallway by a tentacle
               wrapped around her legs. She struggles frantically, trying to
               get a clear shot off. But her shot goes wild as she is pulled
               this way and that, slammed against the walls on either side.
               She loses her rifle.

               Finnegan ENTERS the glass-domed atrium. Sloshes through the
               water. Stops in the middle and looks around. Sees a Tentacle,
               writhing up a glass wall of the atrium. Finnegan hears
               TRILLIAN SCREAM. He quickly plants his feet and FIRES from
               the hip. GLASS SHATTERS EVERYWHERE. He arcs around. WINDOWS
               BLOW TO PIECES. Finnegan lets out a low, angry, guttural
               YELL. The TENTACLE SHREDS from the GUNFIRE.

               up, grabs her rifle, and RUNS LIKE HELL.

               more stuck. Behind her, deep in the web, Tentacles slowly
               start squirming their way towards her. Trillian feels the
               GELATIN start to MOVE. She struggles wildly. 

               Panicked. Finnegan ENTERS the room. Spots Trillian. Starts
               sloshing his way through the water. Trillian sees him coming.

                         Finnegan!

               Trillian looks back. Sees the Tentacles coming out of the
               darkness of the web. Twenty feet back and closing.

               Finnegan runs up and grabs her. Tries to pull her free. But
               she's stuck good. He looks behind her to the tentacles
               quickly closing in on her. Now fifteen feet away.

               As she struggles, Finnegan pulls out his knife, and starts to
               hack away at the sticky webbing. Trillian tries to look
               behind her.

                         Don't look!! Push!!

               Trillian struggles with every last ounce of her strength. Now

                         FINNEEGGGAANNN!!!

               Finnegan hacks away with desperate urgency. Now five feet.

                         Grab my hands!!

               Finnegan plunges his hands into the goo. Trillian latches
               onto Finnegan's wrists, he onto hers. Four feet.

                         Push!! Push!!

               Finnegan strains, pulling, until every muscle in his body
               keens with the effort, every vein pops to the surface.
               Trillian pushes for all she is worth. Three feet...two
               feet...one foot...

                                   BOTH
                         YYYEEEAAAHHH!!! 

               With a last gargantuan effort, Finnegan yanks...Trillian
               comes tearing out of the webbing...the remnants of her gown
               doesn't...in the nick of time. 

               The tentacle rushes forward. Finnegan jams his pulse-rifle
               into the web and OPENS FIRE. Blasting the entire clip into
               the goo. Tearing the shit out of it. BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!!! 

               And that's when the whole ROOM starts to QUAKE. And SHAKE!
               Finnegan and Trillian both look down at their feet as they
               hear the LOWER DECKS EXPLODING UPWARD, one at a time -- BAM! 
               - BAM! -- BAM! Something is rising up through the ship. He
               grabs Trillain and pulls her toward the exit. She scoops her
               fallen pulse rifle off the floor.

               door is bolted tight. She has not other options. She runs
               off.

                                                       CUT TO:

       145     FRISCO BAR - NIGHT                                     145

               Finnegan turns as the DANCE FLOOR and the D.J. BOOTH EXPLODE
               as SOMETHING RISES UP from below them. His eyes widen. And
               there it is -- The huge, horrible, mutated, mucus-covered,
               sucker-faced HEAD OF THE CREATURE. 

               A giant mutated protoplasm. Jutting up from a breach in the
               floor. The trunk of the Creature, the part where all the
               Tentacles come from, is below the next deck. A slimy,
               translucent MEMBRANE slowly RISES, REVEALING what appears to
               be some sort of ORGANIC LIQUID EYE. It seems to stare right
               at Finnegan, who is transfixed by the sight. A Tentacle
               slowly starts to move in on Finnegan. 

               Finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris
               that blocks his shot. The EYEBALL-type organism follows him.
               Another Tentacle starts to move. Silently undulating through
               the water towards Finnegan. The membrane over the EYE moves.
               And another Tentacle starts to close in for the kill. They
               are surrounding Finnegan. Finnegan comes around the shattered
               D.J. booth. Faces the Creature full-on. He can't miss. He
               gives it a wicked smile.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Get a good look...

               In SLOW-MOTION, Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle. It DRIPS
               WATER. He jams the gun-butt into his hip. Takes aim -- FIRES!
               But he only gets off one quick BURST before a TENTACLE LASHES
               OUT and GRABS him. JERKS him into the air. His pulse-rifle
               goes flying. Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into
               the floor, and the death that awaits him.
               He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer,
               closer. He is about to disappear down the hole of no return,
               when his hand comes up with his knife. He slashes the
               tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. As
               he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him.
               Huge. Blocking his way. It's maw opens wide. A terrifying
               sight of jaws and teeth and death. About to devour him. As it
               strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the
               vile thing to smithereens. He bolts through the door, several
               Tentacles already after him.

                                                       CUT TO:

       146     WATERSPORTS PLATFORM - NIGHT                           146

               Trillian sits up on the jet ski. She hears the GUNFIRE.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         FINNEGAN!! COME ON!!

                                                       CUT TO:

       147     PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT                                     147

               Finnegan runs wildly down a passageway. He rounds a corner. A
               TENTACLE SIDE-SWIPES him. Hard. SMASHES him into a wall.
               Finnegan DROPS the shotgun. Hits the floor running. Another
               TENTACLES CHECKS him. Sends him SPIRALING through a hatch. 

               Finnegan TUMBLES in. Face-first. Quickly rolls over and looks
               back -- A TENTACLE LASHES in through the doorway. Finnegan
               back-pedals on his hands and feet, stumbling over various
               sports equipment. The TENTACLE homes-in on him. CHARGES
               FORWARD. Finnegan hurls himself backwards. THROWING anything
               that comes to hand at the Tentacle. A VOLLEYBALL. A WATERSKI.
               A TACKLE BOX. A FRISBEE. But onward it comes. Finnegan back
               pedals faster. Over diving gear. Scuba tanks. Fins and masks. 

               The TENTACLE RISES. About to STRIKE. 

               Finnegan backs into the wall. Trapped. He spots a SPEARGUN.
               Grabs it. 

               The TENTACLE LUNGES. Finnegan FIRES. NAILS IT. PINS IT to the
               wall. Finnegan scrambles past the furiously WRITHING TENTACLE
               and runs out of the room.

                                                       CUT TO:

       148     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            148

               Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into
               the dark water. She frantically whispers to herself:

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Oh my God, oh my God.

               Suddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, SOMETHING SWIRLS
               through the water. Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it. Eyes
               wide. Knuckles white. Breathing hard. WHAMM!! Something drops
               onto the ski behind her.

                                   TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                         EEEEYYYYAAAHHH!!!!

               She turns, ghost white...to Finnegan.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         I don't mean to drop in unannounced
                         ...you ready...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Soon as I get over the heart
                         attack...

               Finnegan whistles. Waits. No engine goes on. He whistles
               again. Still no response. Removes his watch, gives it to
               Trillian.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Three minutes...I'm not back...no
                         matter what...you go...

                                   TRILLIAN
                         No...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         You don't take orders very well, do
                         you?

                                   TRILLIAN
                         I don't take orders at all.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         This time, make an exception.

               He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of
               the Saipan, and scales up to the deck. Trillian watches him,
               and then looks at the watch.

                                                       CUT TO:

       149     SAIPAN PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT                             149

               Finnegan bursts in.

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Pantucci!... JOEY!

               Then he spots something on the floor. He reaches down and
               picks it up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's been
               RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares at it. His grip tightening.
               Tears rising in his eyes. His jaw clenching. Then he flings
               the belt aside. Filled with rage.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Time to die, motherfucker.

               Finnegan hits the ignition button. A desperate moment of dry
               cranking ...and then the one remaining engine catches,
               sputters, and fires to life.

                                                       CUT TO:

       150     FUJI MARU - NIGHT                                      150

               Trillian hears the Saipan's engine come to life. She hits the
               ignition on the jet ski. Right next to her something drops
               from the deck of the Saipan into the water. Finnegan clambers
               up in front of her. His pulse rifle still in hand.

                                   TRILLIAN
                         Where's you friend?

                                   FINNEGAN
                         He's not coming...

               The Saipan strains on its leashes. ENGINES GUNNING. Finnegan
               swings his rifle around. OPENS UP on the tie-lines. All the
               TIE-LINES SHRED. The Saipan starts to break free.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Hold on!

               He GUNS the ski...and it stalls. The jet ski stalls. Goes
               dead in the water.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Oh shit!!

               Nearby, the WATER SWIRLS violently. He hammers the starter
               button.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Come on!!

               The ENGINE STUTTERS. He tries again.

                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)
                         Come on!!

               Another STUTTER. More WATER SWIRLS, getting closer now. But
               the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and
               shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle
               comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it,
               blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN
               LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks
               force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle.

       151     FAST:                                                  151

               Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal
               to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for
               dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski.
               Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS.
               The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the
               MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the
               Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE
               EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski.
               Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways
               across the water.

               BOUNCING HARD.

               Trillian can't hold on. Flips off the back. Skips across the
               water. Finnegan ROARS away. A tentacle hard on his ass.
               Trillian pops to the surface. Treads water. Panicked. Watches
               Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. Finnegan looks
               back at Trillian. Bobbing in the water. The he looks at the
               Saipan. Continuing its arc. Its deadly payload racing for the
               Fuji Maru. Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS. SMASHES through a
               wave and heads for Trillian. Trillian sees him and swims
               hard. The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru. The warhead
               perfectly positioned to strike its hull. Only fifty meters
               away. Now forty. Now thirty-five.

       152     FASTER:                                                152

               Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski. Slides up next to
               Trillian. Grabs her by her arm. Rips her out of the water.
               Throws her onto the back of the jet ski. Just as a tentacles
               rises up, lashing out. He GUNS IT. SMASHES through the waves.
               The WARHEAD SPLASHES through the water. The jet ski hauls
               ass.

               ENGINES WHINING OUT.

               Faster and faster. A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER EXPLODES in front
               of the jet ski. A tentacle slaps down hard. Finnegan cuts
               hard. Too late. The JET SKI RAMPS through the geyser.
               They and the JET SKI TUMBLE and SPLASH across the water. The
               SAIPAN CHARGES FORWARD. 

               Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty
               meters away. Now fifteen.

               Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find
               Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles
               converging on him from the murky depths. The "retrieve"
               feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards
               where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the
               surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet
               ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging
               Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides. 

               The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed
               whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The
               WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away
               from hitting the Fuji Maru.

               Now nine meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five.

       153     GO INTO SLO-MO NOW AS:                                 153

               Finnegan paddles hard. Sucking in as much water as he is air.
               A TENTACLE RISES UP out of the water. Looms above Finnegan
               and Trillian. Dripping water. About to strike. There's
               nowhere to hide. Finnegan paddles harder.

       154     COME OUT OF SLOW-MO AS:                                154

               The TENTACLE starts its DOWNWARD LUNGE. And that's when the
               SAIPAN RAMS the Fuji Maru. The WARHEAD SLAMS into its hull.

               BA-WHOOOOOOMMM!!

               The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.

               METAL FLIES.

               WATER SPRAYS.

               FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru
               CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan
               drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another
               EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea.
               Sends shock waves across the water. 

               Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island.
               Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU
               SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface.
               A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and
               STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the
               water.

                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

       155     BEACH - SUNRISE                                        155

               Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the
               beach of the island. 

               They collapse next to each other. Finnegan is exhausted.
               Trillian coughs up seawater. They both turn and look out to
               sea, and the rising sun. Trillian reaches into her bra, and
               pulls out the egg sized diamond. She holds it up. The sun
               refracts off it brilliantly... 

               Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture
               perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she
               heaves it as far as she can into the sea. For the first time
               since they know each other there is nobody around. No people.
               No tentacles. And when they look at each other, something
               else comes to mind besides survival. 

               Finnegan moves towards Trillian. Trillian moves towards
               Finnegan. Their lips move closer, closer... 

               And then, down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE
               WATER! Scares the shit out of them. The audience too.

               But it's just Pantucci. Looking waterlogged and shell-
               shocked. Coughing up half the sea. Finnegan and Trillian help
               him to his feet.

                         Was it the water in my eyes or were
                         you guys about to...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Because it's cool, you know, I can
                         always take a walk or something
                         down the beach...

                                   FINNEGAN
                         Joey...

                                   PANTUCCI
                         Or I could go for a
                         swim...although, I gotta tell
                         you...if I never get in the water
                         again...

                                   BOTH
                         Joey!!

                                   PANTUCCI
                         OK...OK...you don't have to beg me
                         ...I'll stick around...

               And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling,
               teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like no sound or
               animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. Coming from DEEP
               WITHIN THE ISLAND.

                                   PANTUCCI (CONT'D)
                         Or maybe not...

               Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND.
               We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up. MORE STRANGE
               NOISES ARE HEARD. FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES. 

               WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING more of this creepy-looking
               island. And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach. 

               WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING pieces of the smoldering
               ship. Nearly the whole island is VISIBLE now. Dark jungles.
               Craggy mountains. Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth.

                                   FINNEGAN (V.O.)
                         What now...

               The "THING" ROARS again. It's hellacious. 

               AND WE CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END

    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96


    FADE IN:


1   INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY                                  1

    Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air
    conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is
    full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an
    efficient man with a good case.

    The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a
    witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
    carefully rehearsed.

                             BARBARA
               ... we go back to our homeroom for
               dismissal, unless you have a pass
               for sports or something.

                             PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
               And is that what you did on the
               day in question?

                            BARBARA
               No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay
               after class.

                             PROSECUTOR
               What happened next, Barbara?

                             BARBARA
               Mr. Gettys closed the door.

                             PROSECUTOR
               Everyone else had gone?

                             BARBARA
               Yes. He told me to sit in the
               chair beside his desk.

    MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
    respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
    enduring this testimony.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              2.

1   CONTINUED:                                                      1

                               PROSECUTOR
                 In your own words, Barbara, can
                 you tell us exactly what happened
                 during the next few minutes?

    KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in.

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 I told him I was afraid I would
                 miss my bus. He promised I would
                 get to the bus on time if I would
                 help him to do something...

    Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
    taking inventory -- assessing damage --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... Then he put -- before I could
                 say anything -- he placed his hand
                 inside my blouse...

    Kevin -- checking the jury and --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... I was so frightened I didn't
                 move. I thought if I was just
                 quiet it would be okay...

    Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
    him cold --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... Then his other hand went up
                 under -- inside my skirt...

    Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
    but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
    feeling their way along the leg of his chair --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... his hand then, it started, he
                 started, moving back and forth --
                 farther and farther inside my
                 skirt...

    Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... he said he was testing to see
                 if I had any special feelings,
                 that he wanted to find out what
                 kind of feelings I had...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              3.

1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               1

    Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
    absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... I didn't know what to say, I
                 was trying to think of something
                 to say but I was confused and he
                 just kept on -- with his hand --
                 moving it -- under my dress --
                 higher and higher...

    Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it.

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 ... then I, I was asking him to
                 stop but it was like he couldn't
                 hear me -- he just kept on --

    Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --

                               BARBARA (O.S.)
                 -- and then I screamed...

    Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
    Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
    caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --

                               BARBARA
                 ... then he, he got mad and said
                 we would have to try again
                 sometime.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 And did he try again?

                                BARBARA
                 Not with me.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 With friends of yours?

                                BARBARA
                 Yes.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 And when you told them what he had
                 done to you, they told you what he
                 had done to them, isn't that true?

                                BARBARA
                 Yes.

                               PROSECUTOR
                 I have nothing further.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                4.

                               JUDGE
                        (finding Kevin)
                 Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

                               KEVIN
                 Any chance, Your Honor, for a
                 short recess?

2   INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE HALL - DAY                               2

    Kevin heading quickly away from the courtroom.     Gettys
    right on his heels.

                               KEVIN
                 Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm
                 advising you to get the fuck away
                 from me.

                                GETTYS
                 Why?   What are you talking about?

                               KEVIN
                 The wife. The kid. The outrage.
                 You definitely had me fooled.

                               GETTYS
                 You're my lawyer! You're here to
                 defend me!

                               KEVIN
                 You know what I'm thinking? Why
                 don't we put you on the stand and
                 you can jerk off for the judge.

                               GETTYS
                 You know she's lying.

                               KEVIN
                 Get the hell out of my way.

    Gettys standing aside, as we --

3   INT. FLORIDA COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM - DAY                         3

    An ancient upstairs facility. Kevin standing at the
    mirror. Frozen there. Identity crisis. Morality
    crisis. He takes off his wedding ring. Letting cold
    water run in the sink. His eyes never leaving the
    mirror.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

    Behind him, the door opens.     A local REPORTER enters,
    moves to the urinal.

                               REPORTER
                 Well, hell, there you are. Rumor
                 was you were out wandering in
                 traffic.

                               KEVIN
                 Not now, Larry.

                               REPORTER
                 What's the game plan, Kevin? I
                 got a four-thirty deadline. I
                 need a quote. Gimme a quote.

                                KEVIN
                 Fuck off.

                               REPORTER
                 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on
                 today's events. Speculation,
                 however, was widespread that the
                 young lawyer's unblemished string
                 of victories would come to an end
                 in this courtroom.'

    Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as
    THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly,
    becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...

                               REPORTER
                 It was a nice run, Kev. Had to
                 close out someday. Nobody wins
                 'em all.

    The Reporter exits.      Kevin alone with the mirror.

    And then it's over.

    He's made his decision. Replacing his wedding ring.
    Reaching for his jacket, as we --

    Barbara on the stand.   Everyone in place.

                            KEVIN
              Math hasn't exactly been your
              subject this year, has it?

                               BARBARA
              No.

                            KEVIN
              Any theories on why you've done so
              poorly in math this year?

                            BARBARA
              It's not my fault.

                            KEVIN
              Would you say Mr. Gettys is the
              problem?
                     (as she shrugs)
              You're not sure. Have you had
              any discipline problems in math
              class this year?

                               BARBARA
              No.

                            KEVIN
              No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has
              had to talk to you repeatedly
              about your behavior? Isn't that
              why he asked you to stay after
              class?

                               BARBARA
              No.

                            KEVIN
              Have other teachers ever asked you
              to stay after class?

                               BARBARA
              Once or twice.

                            KEVIN
              Did they want to talk about your
              behavior?

                              PROSECUTOR
              Objection.    Immaterial.

                            KEVIN

                 I don't know what the other
                 teachers wanted. You'd have to
                 talk to them.

                 You ever pass notes in class,
                 Barbara? Maybe a note that made
                 fun of Mr. Gettys?

                                 BARBARA
                 No.

                               KEVIN
                 No? Never called him a
                 'disgusting pig monster'?

                                 BARBARA
                 No.

                 I'm gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax,
                 I'm also gonna suggest that if
                 you have any other exhibits you
                 present in a timely fashion or not
                 at all.

                 The word special came up in your
                 testimony earlier. You claimed
                 that Mr. Gettys asked you whether
                 you had special feelings, if you
                 felt special.

                 We only played it once.

                 This special party, Barbara, this
                 was the first time you told the
                 story about Mr. Gettys.

                               BARBARA

                 I've spoken to the other children
                 who were there that day. Can you
                 think of anything else, Barbara,
                 they might have told me about that
                 party?

                 You threatened those children,

                               BARBARA
                 That's not the way it happened --

                               KEVIN
                 You told them to falsely claim
                 that Mr. Gettys had hurt them,
                 didn't you?

                 They happened to me.

                               KEVIN
                 So you made up a story. A
                 special story, about a math
                 teacher -- a disgusting pig
                 monster -- you didn't like.
                 That's what really happened,

    LAWYER friends, the Reporter and someone's girl friend.
    12 shot glasses, two rows of six. A perfect tequila pour

                 through the door of reasonable
                 doubt?

     Two dozen cars parked.    MUSIC and SINGING from inside.    A

                   "SEMINOLE CALVARY CHURCH OF THE REDEEMER"


10   INT. FLORIDA CINDERBLOCK CHURCH - DAY                            10

     Inside the church. Plain and functional. Poor but
     faithful. A trio -- electric guitar, accordion,
     tambourine -- playing a hymn. Forty-five voices raised
     in song. The tempo is ragged and the pitch shaky, but
     the feeling is strong. They mean it.

     The CAMERA FINDS -- MRS. LOMAX. Kevin's mother. Forty- six.
     Singing her heart out. A woman with faith, in the
     presence of her Lord.

     The CAMERA FINDS -- Kevin. In the very back. Standing

                  It's two weeks at most.

                                MRS. LOMAX
                  You've never been to New York.

                  Pick a jury...
                         (ridiculous)
                  I feel the hand of Mary Ann on
                  this adventure.

                  Mom.

                                MRS. LOMAX
                  New York is not a good idea.

                                KEVIN
                  Look, how you fixed for cash?

                                MRS. LOMAX
                  I have my bad feeling.

                         (an envelope)
                  I put a couple hundred in here...

                                MRS. LOMAX
                  Sounds like more than two weeks.

                  Mary Ann typed out the numbers for
                  you -- phone, the flights -- it's
                  all in there.

                                MRS. LOMAX
                  Let me tell you about New York.

                  Babylon.

                                MRS. LOMAX
                  Forewarned is forearmed.
                         (half-serious)
                  'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
                  great. It has become a dwelling
                  place of demons.' Revelation
                  Eighteen. Wouldn't hurt you to
                  look it over.

                                KEVIN
                         (rolls with it)
                  Couldn't forget it if I tried.

     VOICES -- KEVIN and MARY ANN. They're LAUGHING. Coming
     in from a big night out. For an instant -- light -- we

                      (her best drawl)
               Surely you don't think a small-

               because a man buys her dinner in
               the big city.

               No, ma'am. In fact, I hardly ever
               think at all.

                             MARY ANN
               Well, that's different, then.

     Criminal court. Voire dire. Potential jurors fill the
     benches. A bored judge. MEISEL, defense counsel, is a
     sour, New York veteran. The juror being questioned, a
     PIE-FACED MAN with bad vision.

                                MEISEL
                  Do you think as a juror you'd be
                  able to set aside any prior
                  opinions you might hold about the

                  What?   Do I like bankers?

     Heath catches Meisel's eye.     Waves him over.

                                MEISEL
                  Your Honor, may I have a minute to
                  speak with my colleagues.


     ANGLE ON DEFENSE TABLE

     Kevin and Heath. And the defendant -- a well-tailored
     reptilian banker. Meisel joins them. Sotto voce.

                                KEVIN
                  Dump him. While you're at it
                  let's get rid of number six,
                  eight, and I'd say lose number
                  twelve, except the prosecutor's
                  gonna fuck up and do it for us.

                               MEISEL
                  Number six? You're kidding,
                  right? She's my first choice.

                                KEVIN
                  She's my first pass.

                                MEISEL
                  And eight? With the dreadlocks?
                  That's crazy. He's a defendant
                  juror if I ever saw one.

                                KEVIN
                  You see his shoes?

                                MEISEL
                  Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
                  you're the next big thing, but
                  this is New York. Manhattan.
                  We're not squeezing oranges here.

                  He polishes those shoes every
                  night. He makes his own clothes.
                  He may look like a brother-with-
                  an-attitude to you, but I see a
                  man who's got a shotgun under his
                  bed and woe betide the creature
                  who steps into his garden.

                  And number six? Your favorite?
                  She's damaged goods.

                  She's a Catholic schoolteacher.
                         (to Heath)
                  She believes in human frailty.

                                KEVIN
                  No. There's something missing
                  from her. She's wrong.
                         (eyes to the pool)
                  She wants on this jury. Somebody
                  hurt her and she wants revenge.

                                MEISEL
                  How the hell do you know that?

                         (honestly)

                  Look, either you put a stop to
                  this happy horseshit or I walk.

                                HEATH
                  Walk.

                         (a pause)
                  All right. Here's the deal.
                         (to Kevin)
                  I lose with your jury? You do the

                  Oh, Kevin... I'm sorry, honey. What
                  the hell did they expect? The man
                  is guilty as can be. Wasn't a jury
                  anywhere gonna let him off.

                                 KEVIN
                  Yeah.   Except one.

     on the wall. The decor is stark, dramatic, awesome. The
     receptionist is simply stunning. Kevin, wearing his best
     suit, walking with Heath.

                  Sorry to keep you waiting, but Mr.
                  Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
                  a little longer than expected.
                         (quietly as they

                  Not bad, huh? You can play it cool

     Lawyers come in all shapes and sizes. Assistants -- male
     and female -- are uniformly attractive. The HUM of
     serious BUSINESS in the background.

                                HEATH
                         (as they walk)
                  We've got forty partners vested at
                  the moment. Close to six hundred
                  associates. This is the home
                  office, but we've got quite a few
                  international arrangements, so Mr.
                  Milton spends a good deal of his
                  time in the air. In addition to
                  our corporate clients, we're
                  currently representing about
                  twenty-five foreign countries.
                  Mid-East, Balkans, Central
                  America, West Africa. Interesting
                  work, but travel intensive.

     Kevin slowing as they pass an open doorway --

     THROUGH a large window we see a woman pacing her office.
     She's wearing a headset and arguing in machine-gun
     Italian. She is a goddess. Her name is CHRISTABELLA.
     She is beautiful beyond propriety. She will also turn
     out to be a brilliant EUC lawyer. She turns. Sees us
     staring -- like that -- Venetian blinds close tightly.

     Kevin about six steps into it when suddenly, he looks
     down. Stops. Completely spooked.

     Kevin sucks it up.      Starts walking.    Up ahead, nothing

     First of all it's round. And large. The walls are made
     of stone. No windows. There are dramatic shafts of
     natural light from above. Stark and clean to the
     extreme. No paper anywhere.

                  Out of law school. Five years in

                  Sixty-four straight convictions.
                  What a number.

                  I like to be in court.   I didn't
                  plea out a lot.

                                MILTON
                  What's that like? One day you're
                  putting them away and the next
                  you're setting them free?

                                KEVIN
                  Takes a little getting used to.

                  Pays better though, doesn't it?

                  Upstairs men's room in the Duval

                  Love it all you want, just don't
                  repeat it. I'm not sure the
                  Florida Bar Association would
                  appreciate it.

                  I never got to know my father. He
                  passed away before I was born. My
                  mom raised me. Just the two of
                  us.

                  She's a preacher's daughter.
                  She's tough. She's worked in the
                  same poultry plant for as long as
                  I can remember. I think she's up
                  to eight-fifty an hour. She's got
                  a church she really likes, so
                  she's usually either there or they
                  go out, they do a lot of volunteer
                  work.

                  'Many are in high places, and of
                  great renown: but mysteries are
                  revealed unto the meek.'

                                   KEVIN
                  So they say.

                                MILTON
                  Didn't rub off on you?    The book?
                  The church?

                                   KEVIN
                  I'm on parole.     Early release for
                  time served.

     Suddenly they're quiet.       Silenced by the view.

                                MILTON
                  Lotta potential clients down
                  there. (Sooner or later it all
                  flows through the streets.)

                                KEVIN
                  You don't have to sell me on New
                  York.

                                MILTON
                  You like it here, don't you?

                                KEVIN
                  Are we negotiating?

                                   MILTON
                  Always.

                                KEVIN
                  Why do you need a criminal
                  department?

                                MILTON
                  Because our clients break the law
                  just like everyone else and I'm
                  tired of sending their business
                  across the street.

                                KEVIN
                  Are you offering me a job?

                                MILTON
                  I'm thinking about it. You have
                  the talent. I knew that before
                  you got here. It's the other
                  thing I wonder about.

                  Pressure. Changes everything.
                  Some people, you squeeze them,
                  they focus. Some people fold.
                  Can you summon your talent at
                  will? Can you deliver on

                  let you all down.

                  perfect. It's intimate. It's
                  quick. Doesn't cost a thing.
                  There's a power to it. What is

     PHILLIPE MOYEZ squatting in the corner. Skinny and
     intense. His eyes opaque and piercing at the same time.
     At once unassuming and terrifying. A plastic bag of
     fresh green roots in his lap. Ghat. Miraa. African
     cocaine. His teeth black from chewing it.

                  research -- precedent -- cases in
                  the past that dealt with Santeria
                  and Vou--

                               MOYEZ
                  No. This is not Santeria. We are
                  not Voodoo. Candomble.
                  Obeayisne. None of that. We are
                  much older. Before. Before all
                  of it.

                                 KEVIN
                  Okay.   Is there a name?   Or...

                                MOYEZ
                  We have papers. At your firm.      We
                  have the tax exemption.

                                KEVIN
                  Okay.  I'll get right into that.

                                MOYEZ
                  We have an investment in blood.
                  Think of it as spiritual currency.

     Moyez stands.    Starts slowly across the room.

                                KEVIN
                  Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going to need

                  Yes.   That's very clear.

                                KEVIN
                  Perhaps we could start at the
                  beginning?

     Moyez, ignoring him, moves to an old refrigerator beside
     the stairs. For an instant, the door is open -- just a
     glimpse. Meat. Bags of entrails. Jars of blood. Moyez
     goes to a workbench near the wall --

     Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers.        A
     huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are

                That's a veal roast, Your Honor.
                U.S.D.A. approved and stamped.
                Eight days ago, in Kansas City,
                two men pushed a calf into a steel
                frame as a third man fired a high-
                voltage staple-gun into the
                animal's skull. Men kill animals
                and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez
                killed a goat. He killed a goat.
                And he did it at home, in a manner
                consistent with his religious
                beliefs. Now some people may find
                it bizarre.

                  It's certainly not a religious
                  practice performed by everyone.
                  It's not as common as, say,
                  circumcision. It's certainly not
                  as common as the belief that wine
                  is transformed into blood. It's
                  not even as common as the handling
                  of poisonous snakes to prove one's
                  faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't
                  two thousand miles away in a
                  stockyard. He doesn't use
                  electricity to kill. And worst of
                  all...
                         (holding up
                           the roast)
                  Phillipe Moyez is not shrink-

     Merto begins to cough.    Quietly at first, but...

                                KEVIN
                  Your Honor, the city timed this
                  police action to catch my client
                  exercising his constitutionally-
                  protected right to religious
                  freedom.

     Merto's coughing getting worse as he tries to stop...

                                JUDGE SKLAR
                  This is a law protecting Kosher
                  butchering.

                                KEVIN
                  Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like
                  to move at this time for an
                  immediate directed verdict for
                  dismissal.

     Moyez staring a hole in Merto, and the man cannot stop
     coughing...

                                JUDGE SKLAR
                  I happen to know a little bit
                  about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

                  It's gotta be in your blood. It's

                  thousand lawyers working around

                  how did that happen? And see,
                  right there, from that moment on,

                  I was kidding.

                                MILTON
                  You're not here to amuse me.
                  See, that's why people hate lawyers.
                  So many of us have lost our faith.
                  Don't let that happen to you.

     Kevin just coming in from work. The apartment is
     starting to come together. Still not enough furniture,
     but the sparseness reads as elegance.

     He stops. In the hallway -- a wall is missing --
     sheetrock stacked on the floor -- tools piled around -- a
     renovation project halted for the night.

                                KEVIN

     Mary Ann up the hall in the bedroom door.      Finishing her
     makeup for a night out.

                                MARY ANN
                  Oh, that...
                         (smiles)
                  It was gonna be a nursery, but
                  then I remembered you'd have to be
                  home long enough to knock me up,
                  so now I'm thinking of building a
                  law library.

     Kevin smiles.    Drops his briefcase.     Drops his pants.

                                MARY ANN
                  Save the thought. We were due up
                  there fifteen minutes ago.

     She blows him a kiss.    Ducking back into bedroom.

               I love the eights. The entire 'A'
               line -- such a great shell.
                      (manic and perhaps
                       a bit insane)
               I do. I envy you. Starting from
               scratch. Do you have your fabrics
               yet? Tell me you don't.

                              MARY ANN
               Not yet.   I don't think so.

                             DIANA
               Come with me. Instantly.
                      (to Kevin)
               I'm borrowing your wife...

                  Deadbeats. I mean, that's what it
                  comes down to. You can call
                  yourself a finance trainee, or
                  a financial resources adviser,
                  or whatever, you're still

                  No deadbeats here tonight.

                                MILTON
                  You'd be surprised. There's a
                  lot more fear in this room than

                                MILTON
                  You'll figure that out. There's
                  only one thing worth being
                  frightened of anyway, and that's
                  being alone. Truly and finally
                  alone.

                                 MARY ANN
                  Yes.   I think you're right.

                                MILTON
                  You know what terrifies me?

                                 MARY ANN
                  For what?

                                MILTON
                  For what. For you. Let's be
                  honest, I've changed your life.
                  Changed it forever. There's
                  been a seismic shift in your
                  existence and I'm responsible.
                  And you've never even met me.
                  We're talking for the very
                  first time. How insane is that?

                  having mine.

                  So you've got a lot at stake here.
                  You've made a real commitment.

                  If it isn't, will you come to me?
                  Let me help? I'd feel a lot less
                  responsible. Will you do that
                  for me?

                                MARY ANN
                  Sure.

                                MILTON
                  The worst vice is advice, right?
                  But can I make a suggestion?
                  It's about your hair, some people
                  are sensitive, that's why I ask.

                               MARY ANN
                  No. I mean, go ahead. You don't
                  like it?

                                MILTON
                  You have shoulders nobody can see.
                  Pull it back.

                                MARY ANN
                  You mean, you want me to pull my
                  hair back?

                  If I do it, everyone in this room
                  that's pretending not to watch us
                  will assume we're fucking or
                  something. Pull back your hair.
                         (there's the mirror)
                  Take a look. See. That's it.
                  Isn't that incredible? You need
                  to cut your hair.

                                MARY ANN
                  You're kidding.

                  A woman's shoulders are the
                  frontlines of her mystique.
                  And her neck, if she's alive,
                  has the very mystery of a
                  border town. It's the no

     Kevin standing at the rail.    He looks over.   Christabella
     not ten feet away.

               Do you have this view?

               From your terrace, is this your
               view?

                             KEVIN
               Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about
               twelve floors down. What about
               you?

                             CHRISTABELLA
               No, I live downtown. This is the
               family building.

                             KEVIN
               Sounds like fun. Downtown, I
               mean. I'm just getting to know
               the city.

                             CHRISTABELLA
               Is it everything you expected?

                      (raising her glass)
               May we always have more than we
               expect. Salute.

                                KEVIN
               Amen.

                                CHRISTABELLA
               Are you alone?

                             KEVIN
               You mean, tonight?

                             CHRISTABELLA
               Is your wife a jealous woman?
                      (beat)
               Silly question. We're all

                    Depends on the view.

       Milton in the doorway.      He's been watching them.

     Just enough light to make out two MEN standing across the

                Sorry...
                       (in doorway)
                I'm looking for my husband.

     The Men -- two vaguely familiar faces from the firm.

                              MAN #1
                Don't think he's here.

     Suddenly, a WOMAN's head rises INTO FRAME --

                              WOMAN
                It's just us...

                              MAN #2
                But feel free to join in...

     And suddenly it's clear, she's walked in on an impromptu
     menage a trois. The Woman is kneeling on a table, dress
     hiked up, ass in the air. Man #1 fucking her from behind.
     Man #2 is getting blown and --

     Mary Ann IN SHOT as the woman begins to laugh and the door
     WIPES the FRAME.

     The penthouse. One enormous room. Grand scale
     everything. Otherworldly. Staggering. Of special,
     special interest: a huge Bas Relief dominates an entire
     wall. Carved into the marble are human forms -- young,
     naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds.

     Milton is on the phone. Two lines going. The dialogue
     is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway -- he's
     going back and forth between Korean and Russian --
     brokering some emergency deal.

     Heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. Barzoon has a cigar.
     Kevin just standing there gaping at the space.

                             KEVIN
               Is there more to it?

                             BARZOON
               Just this room.

                                KEVIN
               And a bedroom?

                                BARZOON
               No bedroom.

                             KEVIN
               Where does he sleep?

                  grandmother supporting seven
                  children. And then there's your
                  stepson, a ten-year-old with a
                  bullet in his brain. Those are
                  already powerful images in the mind

                  discover the crime. You call it

                   Congratulations on Cullen.

                                    KEVIN
                   Thank you.

                   What an incredible situation, even
                   if you lose you become a star.

                                    KEVIN
                   Any advice?

                                 CHRISTABELLA
                   Cullen is a pig. He's a pig
                   beyond reasonable doubt. I
                   suggest you keep him as far away
                   from the jury as possible.

                                 KEVIN
                   I'll keep it in mind.

                   You can look all you want, but I
                   don't fuck married men.

                                 KEVIN
                   What a relief. I was starting to
                   think you were perfect.

      Mary Ann very upset.    Kevin has just come home.

                                 MARY ANN
                   I don't care if they can hear me!
                   I don't care! I don't like it here.
                   And these women, my God... I mean,
                   I'm seeing things for crissake!

                                 KEVIN
                   You just left them in the store?

                   Yes!

                                 KEVIN
                   Look, calm down, all right?
                   Listen to me... Mare? First,
                   you do this radical thing with
                   your hair...

                                  MARY ANN
                   You hate it.

                                  KEVIN
                   Stop. I think it's fine. But I
                   also think it's traumatic.
                   You've got the pressure of
                   fitting in with new friends,
                   a new place... add three bottles
                   of wine and --

                                 MARY ANN
                   No! It wasn't the wine. It
                   wasn't the wine or my hair or
                   talking to Kathy, because I know
                   that's what you're gonna say --

                                 KEVIN
                   Oh, and that's got nothing to do

                                 MARY ANN
                   Kevin, I never see you anymore.
                   Now that you've got this big case,
                   it's just only gonna get worse. I
                   don't know anybody here. These
                   women scare the living shit out of
                   me. If you can believe it, I'm
                   actually looking forward to having
                   your mother come and visit.

                                 KEVIN
                   What about the apartment?

                                 MARY ANN
                   Exactly! You just go out -- you
                   buy a few new suits and you're
                   fine. I've got this whole place
                   to fill up and I know we have all
                   this money and it's supposed to
                   be fun, but it isn't! It's like
                   a test! The whole thing is
                   like one big test! I'm lonely.

                                 KEVIN
                   Let's make a baby.

                                 MARY ANN
                   Don't tease me.

                                 KEVIN
                   I wouldn't do that. Unless you
                   asked.

                                 MARY ANN
                   You hate my hair, don't you?

      will fuck because they can't stop themselves and she's on

                   it was before I saw Elucinda's
                   body and then, I mean we've been

                   You walk in. Everybody's dead.
                   It's not something you plan for.

                   Right knee. Right hand. It's a
                   strange move you must've made to
                   pick it up.

                   The blood, I don't know, maybe I
                   was trying to avoid the blood.

                   Your hand came from inside and
                   underneath.

      Cullen reaches into his jacket and pulls out a gun.

                   That's my job. When the case is
                   over you can have it back.

                   You feel confident she'll back you
                   on the time.

                                 CULLEN
                   Melissa, yeah. She's okay.     She's
                   a real straight arrow.

                                 KEVIN
                   So we're going to talk to her and

      catching him -- helping him off the train -- looking
      back, as the doors close and...

                 Mare. Stop. The guy pays our
                 bills. The food, the heat, the
                 rent on that enormous fucking
                 apartment we live in.
                        (beat)
                 I live there, too!

       CLICK. The LINE is dead. He looks at the cigarette.
       Takes a hit. Fuck it. And then his eyes find --

       The dressing room across the hall. An open door.
       Inside, a woman, one of the dancers, all but nude,
       stepping into her dress. A simply perfect body.

       And then she turns TOWARD us and it's Christabella --
       clearly -- for a single moment -- before she slams shut
       the door.

       Kevin crosses to the door.   Knocks.   And again.

       The door opens.   A DANCER standing there.    It's not
       Christabella.

                               DANCER
                 Can I help you?

       Kevin already backing toward --

       just realizing that --

       Cullen has joined the party.   He's wasted.   He waves.

       tools and material.

                    You poor thing...

       Mary Ann easing slowly forward.

                 Sorry, Mr. Lomax, I thought we'd
                 scared 'em all away...

                               MRS. LOMAX
                 Always did like to stick his nose
                 in a camera.

                        (as they enter)
                 And how are you, Mrs. Lomax?   Did
                 you have a fine dinner?

                               MRS. LOMAX
                 I surely did.
                        (she's got a
                         doggie bag)
                 Are you hungry?

                                 FEENEY
                 No, I'm fine.    Thank you.

      There he is, waiting for the elevator. With him are
      Christabella and an Asian woman who is so sexy it hurts.
      Kevin off balance from this moment on.

      Mary Ann smells the danger.       Everything is awkward.

                                 MILTON
                   I was just telling the Moyez
                   story.

                                    KEVIN
                   Really.

                                 MILTON
                   And is this your mother?

                                  KEVIN
                   Yes.   Mom, this is...

                   John Milton.    Nice to meet you.

                                   MRS. LOMAX
                   Alice Lomax.    How do you do?

                   I think you've met Christabella,
                   and this is Giselle who's just in
                   from Paris.

      A moment of bullshit superficial greetings and then --
      the elevator doors opening and the whole uncomfortable
      clot of them moving into --

      Just enough room.       They ascend.

                   Thanks for the champagne.

                                 MILTON
                   You've very welcome.
                          (to Mrs. Lomax)
                   This isn't really your first visit
                   to New York, is it?

                   job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.
                   I'm sure it wasn't easy.

                   No.

      Mrs. Lomax has been staring, and now Milton meets her
      eyes as the elevator stops and the doors open.

                                 MARY ANN
                   Nice to see you...

                   Have a lovely evening.

      Kevin next out, holding the door, waiting --

                   Mom, we're here...

                   Yes.   Good night to you.

      Mrs. Lomax takes one last look at Milton as she exits.

                                 MILTON
                   Kevin, hang on...
                          (holding the door)
                   How's Cullen. Everything on beam?

                                 KEVIN
                   That's a long conversation.

      In the b.g., Mary Ann opening the apartment door and
      going inside. Mrs. Lomax right behind her.

                                 MILTON
                          (hush hush)
                   Why don't you come on up?

                                  KEVIN
                   Now?

      Milton smiles.      Christabella smiles.   Giselle smiles.

                   Let's talk tomorrow.

                    That what you're doing when you're

                    about.

                                  KEVIN
                    That's ridiculous.

                ... there is nothing vague or
                exploratory about this subpoena
                request, Your Honor. We're
                specifically asking for any and
                all documents relating to Devada
                Holdings. It's taken six months
                and seventeen separate motions and
                we still don't know who's
                responsible here. We've got a
                paper trail here that seems to
                stretch into eternity!

                Mr. Barzoon?

                              BARZOON
                Can't turn over what you don't
                have, Your Honor. We've been
                conducting a comprehensive search
                of our records and I'm sorry to
                say it's a great deal less than
                Mr. Weaver would suggest.

                              WEAVER
                Your Honor, this is outrageous.
                We need to get in there and seize
                these documents before there's
                nothing left!

                              BARZOON
                Your Honor, it's exactly these
                types of insulting accusations --

                Enough. Both of you. Put it on

                   fast, and put it behind me.
                   Just get it done. Then put all
                   my energy into her.

                   I guess you have thought about it.
                   I stand corrected.

171   INT. CULLEN COURTROOM - DAY                                    171

      Packed. JUDGE ARMAND POE presiding. Cullen seated with
      Kevin and Pam. The jury in their box. And prosecutor FRANK
      BROYGO on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement --

                               BROYGO
                 ... And when all that evidence is
                 laid before you, when all these
                 pieces weave together, you will
                 conclude -- you will know -- that
                 Alexander Cullen is guilty of
                 murdering three people in cold
                 blood with malice aforethought.

      Done.   The courtroom is silent.   The jury liked him.

                               JUDGE POE
                 Mr. Lomax...
                        (checking his watch)
                 We can break for lunch now, or you
                 can do a stop and start...

                               KEVIN
                 If it's a choice, I'll go now. I
                 won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

                               JUDGE POE
                 Proceed.

                               KEVIN
                 We just spent our morning listening
                 to Mr. Broygo talk about his
                 'evidence'. What he neglected to
                 tell you is what this case is
                 really about. He left out the most
                 important fact of all: Alex Cullen
                 was somewhere else when these
                 murders took place. Now, Alex
                 Cullen has done a lot of things I
                 don't like. He's been a terrible
                 husband to all three of his wives.
                 He's been a destructive force in
                 the lives of his step-children.
                 He's cheated the city. His partners.
                 His employees. He's paid hundreds of
                 thousands of dollars in penalties and
                 fines over the years. I don't like
                 those things. I don't expect you to
                 like them. There will be other things
                 during the course of this trial that
                 you will hear about and like even
                 less. But this isn't a popularity
                 contest. It's a murder trial and
                 Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

                   The state is going all out here.
                   They've got a whole team over
                   there. They're throwing
                   everything but the kitchen sink
                   at this case. I need one thing
                   from you. That's it. One thing.
                   I need you to ask yourself, 'Is
                   not liking this man reason
                   enough to convict him of
                   murder?'

                   What the fuck was that? Are you
                   out of your fucking mind?
                          (murderous)
                   They fucking hate me!

      Kevin -- one push -- Cullen sent flying.

                                 KEVIN
                   Listen to me like you've never
                   listened to anybody before. I'm
                   going to bust my ass to make sure
                   they hate you. Because as long as
                   you're out boning Melissa, you're
                   not home killing your wife.

                you tell from a blood sample if
                the person were alive or dead?

                And there's a two hour window in
                which to place these murders.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                Yes.

                              KEVIN
                So, you've got absolutely no way
                to determine the condition of the

       Three running shadows. Side-by-side.     Just passing
       beneath an iron bridge.

                    You take a look at Eddie Barzoon
                    you gotta wonder if maybe God
                    overplayed his hand. Maybe he
                    made the game a little too
                    interesting...

       Barzoon turns back -- stumbles -- catches himself --
       sprinting now to the Pump House. He pulls up here.
       Resting as several other runners pass by. Glancing back,
       almost an afterthought and --

       Those three running shadows are now crossing the bridge
       which is completely impossible considering where they
       just were a moment ago and --

       suddenly looking very empty -- and dark --

       Barzoon -- suddenly turning -- changing course -- leaving
       the path -- into the woods -- quickly ducking down beside
       a huge sycamore tree. Hiding. Sweating. Scared.
       Staring back out at the path --

       Three women runners -- clear as day -- pass beneath a
       streetlight. Team clothes. Machine-like strides. Flat-
       out. And then gone.

       Barzoon stands from behind the sycamore tree. Relief.
       Smiling at his own stupidity. What a jerk. Dusting off.
       Heading back toward the path, when --

       Standing there above him, a crazed-looking homeless
       MAN -- he's white and old and hungry --

                               OLD MAN
                 Gimme your watch.

      tree branch swings out of nowhere -- catching his
      elbow -- snapping it back and --

      A second homeless man. He's black and older than the
      first guy but just as wild and dangerous and he's winding
      up to swing the branch again and --

                You testified that the defendant

                   Look, you gotta go with your gut.

                                 KEVIN
                   That's your advice?

                He let himself in. You need to
                know that. The bath running, or

                Who let himself in?

                              MARY ANN
                I came down here. I've just been
                sitting. I'm afraid to pray. I
                let him stay. I'm sorry. I'm
                sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin.

                              KEVIN
                Did somebody hurt you?

                              MARY ANN
                Milton. He fucked me, Kevin. I
                let him fuck me. I couldn't stop
                him.

                                  KEVIN
                What?     When?

       But someplace completely different. Older.        Dark.   Empty.
       Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out.

       FOOTSTEPS approaching...

       It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead.
       There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his
       side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects.
       More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is
       his frighteningly grim determination.

       Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out.
       Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the
       suitcase.

                                  MRS. LOMAX
                    I could've packed that up for you.

       Kevin sits.    If he loses his steel he'll drown.

                   Finish the story.
                          (off silence)
                   Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in
                   New York. There's a waiter in a
                   restaurant.
                          (waiting)
                   Finish the story.

                                 MRS. LOMAX
                   He talked to me. Nobody'd ever
                   really talked to me before. Sixteen
                   years old, a thousand miles away
                   from home, somebody takes an
                   interest... Working so hard,
                   putting himself through school,
                   I'd never met anybody like that.
                   Knew the Bible, every word, just
                   knew it by heart. Every meal,
                   there he was, at my ear and I
                   just... I didn't want that week to
                   ever end. But it did. He came to
                   say goodbye, it was late, and I
                   started to cry and he said not to
                   worry, 'Behold, I send you out as
                   sheep amidst the wolves.' And that
                   just stopped me cold because we'd
                   spent that whole day at Bible study
                   reading Matthew Ten and there was
                   just no way for him to know about
                   that, so I was... I took it as a
                   sign. I let him in. And then
                   everything was different. He was
                   cruel. He was so cruel and I was
                   so ashamed, I thought I'd die...

      Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase.      Mary Ann...

                                 MRS. LOMAX
                   I promised right there if God would
                   let me back into His grace I would
                   never leave again. I prayed there
                   was a reason this terrible thing
                   had happened. There had to be a
                   reason. And there was. It was
                   you. You were my blessing. You
                   were reason enough to endure
                   anything. How much I love you.

                   What are you doing?

                                  KEVIN
                   I gotta go.

                                 MRS. LOMAX
                   No... let it alone! Stay with me.
                          (panicked)
                   Forget about him! We can leave
                   here. We can go home! We don't
                   ever have to see him again!

                   I can't do that. You go home.

                           after him)
                   I love you!

      Kevin disappearing down the stairs. Mrs. Lomax dropping
      to her knees as his FOOTSTEPS ECHO away, and we --

                                                        CUT TO:


248   EXT. HOSPITAL EXIT AND STREET - DAY                                248

      As Kevin explodes through a fire door.   Pam standing
      there, having a smoke.

                                 PAM
                   There you are...
                          (all smiles)
                   Look at you... you're terrified.
                   Not to worry. He'll take that fear
                   away. You don't ever have to be
                   frightened again. Go on, he's
                   waiting...

      Kevin turning and something is very wrong --


249   EXT. HOSPITAL EXIT AND STREET - DAY                                249

      Fifty-seventh Street is empty. No cars. No people.
      Just the building and the silence. Turning back and
      Pam is gone, and then --

      And then a WIDER ANGLE -- it goes on and on... He's alone.
      Just now realizing the scale of Milton's power. Starting
      to walk, as we --

      The room's only light coming from the huge bas relief.
      Kevin steps off the elevator, into the room.

                   You're right about one thing... I
                   have been watching. Couldn't help
                   myself. Watching, waiting, holding
                   my breath. But I'm no puppeteer,
                   Kevin...

      Milton appears out of nowhere.       Walking past Kevin.

                                 MILTON
                   ... I don't make things happen.
                   Doesn't work like that. Free
                   will -- it's like butterfly wings --
                   one touch and it never gets off the
                   ground. I only set the stage. You
                   pull your own strings.

      Kevin has a gun -- Cullen's gun, in his hand --

                                 KEVIN
                   What did you do to Mary Ann?

                                  MILTON
                   A gun?   In here?

                                 KEVIN
                   What did you do to my wife?

                                 MILTON
                   On a scale of one to ten, ten
                   being the most depraved acts of
                   sexual theater, one being an
                   average Friday night run-through
                   at the Lomax household, I'd say...
                          (beat)
                   Six.

      Kevin FIRES the GUN -- BANG! BANG! BANG! -- bullets pass
      right through him -- into the wall --

                                 MILTON
                   Whoa... Got me! Damn!
                          (laughing)
                   That's my boy. Step on up! Stay
                   angry! Keep hold to that great
                   fury! Hang on tight, Kevin, because
                   it's the final fig leaf.

      Kevin lowers the gun to his side.

                                  KEVIN
                   Who are you?

                   Never lost a case. Why? Why?
                   Because you're so fucking good?
                   Yes. But why?

                                 KEVIN
                   Because you're my father.

                                 MILTON
                   Well, I'm a little more than that.
                   Awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't
                   it? 'What's the game plan, Kevin?'
                          (reporter's voice)

                                 MILTON
                   I have so many names.

                   Come on. You're not listening.
                   Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope
                   you're kidding. You could've saved
                   her any time you liked. She only
                   wanted love. But you knew it
                   wouldn't really work out, didn't
                   you? Mary Ann in New York? Face
                   it, you started looking to better-
                   deal her the minute you got here.

                                   KEVIN
                   That's a lie.

                   Hey, it's not that you didn't care
                   for her, it's just you were a
                   little bit more involved with
                   someone else. Yourself.

                   of your wife -- that the world

                   choice. 'You know what scares me,

                   better and I hate her for it...'

                   Who told you to pull out the stops

                   direction you took -- Snake
                   handlers, Popes and swamis all
                   feeding at the same trough -- whose
                   ideas were those? And then
                   Cullen -- knowing he's guilty --
                   seeing those pictures -- putting
                   that lying bitch on the stand...
                   What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was
                   time to lose, right? You didn't
                   think so.

                                    KEVIN

                   Vanity is definitely my favorite

                   and right at your fingertips.
                   Pride. That's where you're
                   strongest. And believe me, I
                   understand. Work for someone
                   else? -- Hey, I couldn't hack it.

                I've had many children, Kevin. So
                many disappointments. Neurotic,
                indecisive wannabes. Over-eager,
                ham-handed butchers. Strung-out,
                priapic losers. And then there's
                you. Your mother, I'll tell you,
                she outstripped my wildest fantasy.
                That church she dragged you to?
                Every day? What training. What
                a challenge! It's awesome what
                you've done. How far you've come.
                Both of you... You and your sister.

                Surprise.

                No. That's the other guy. I

                                 MILTON
                   I'm here, on the ground, my nose
                   in it since the whole damn thing
                   began. Why? Because I worship
                   man himself. And it's my time
                   now. Our time.

                                 CHRISTABELLA
                   Anybody want a drink? I'm having
                   a drink.

                                 KEVIN
                   This is some pitch. You must need
                   me pretty bad. What do you want?

                                 MILTON
                   Eddie was right. Your name is on
                   the partnership charter. I want
                   you to take over the firm. You
                   and your sister.

                                 KEVIN
                   Is that it?

                   What?

                                 MILTON
                   Your vanity is justified, Kevin,
                   you're the seed to a new future.
                   Your son will sit at the head of
                   all tables. You hold a special
                   place in the history of all things.

                                 KEVIN
                   You want a child.

                                 MILTON
                   I want a family.

                                 KEVIN
                   But I have to volunteer.

      Christabella begins to strip.

                                 MILTON
                   Free will. It's a bitch.
                          (beat)
                   I need a family. I command an ever
                   larger presence on the board. I'm
                   busy and I need some help. There's
                   a plan here. I've been conserving
                   my energy. Synergy. Prioritize.
                   It's the millennium, Kevin. Title
                   fight. Round twenty. I'm ready
                   to work.

                                 KEVIN
                   So what are you offering?

                                 MILTON

                   Like that's wrong. Like there's
                   anything wrong with that. That

                   we cannot buy we will degrade. We
                   will blow every fuse of enlightenment
                   until it looks like a vandalized,

                   It was a nice run. Kev. Had to
                   close out someday. Nobody wins
                   'em all.

      The Reporter exits.    Kevin alone with the mirror and his
      reflection.

      And then it's over. He's made his decision. Replacing
      his wedding ring. Reaching for his jacket, as we --

      opening the doors and --

      Kevin entering. Standing there a moment. Searching for
      Heath in the back of the courtroom. He's not there. A
      single empty seat.

      Kevin moving quickly down the aisle.

      Mary Ann standing there, completely unprepared as Kevin
      comes in behind her. Embracing her. Holding her tightly
      to him with a fervor that we alone will understand.

                                 MARY ANN
                   Honey, what are you doing?
                          (quietly)
                   Are you okay?

      Kevin nods. Smiles. Backs away. Into his seat.        Gettys
      there beside him. Kevin will not look at him.

                                 BAILIFF
                   All rise for the honorable Justice
                   Garson Deeds.

      The Judge enters.    Takes his seat.

                   Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

                                 KEVIN
                   Your Honor, I'm terribly sorry,
                   but I can no longer represent my
                   client. I need to be replaced as
                   counsel.

      Another silence. But this one isn't very long. There
      will be chaos in the courtroom. Gettys will freak out
      and the press will start running for the phones and the
      Judge will be banging that gavel, as we --

      hallway. Kevin trying to rush away with Mary Ann but
      right behind them --

          INT. BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN

          22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep
          as the alarm clock BUZZES. She hits the snooze button and
          plops back down onto the pillow. After a few seconds of pure
          sleeping bliss, she wills herself up.
          She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a "Hang in
          there, baby" poster and into the bathroom.

          INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER

          Stephanie turns on the shower. While waiting for the water to
          heat up, she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated
          pronunciation, recites:

          STEPHANIE
          There is no friction, with proper
          diction. Good sounds abound, when
          the mouth is round.
          She catches herself on the last word, a hint of "Missouri
          twang" slipping through.

          STEPHANIE
          Round.
          Yawn. She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the
          steaming shower.

          INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

          She opens the refrigerator: A half grapefruit sits next to an
          inviting slice of chocolate cake. She's tempted, but chooses
          the grapefruit.

          EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING

          A sunny Southern California day. Commuters speed by.
          Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE,
          across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from
          the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward
          the intersection. The traffic signal changes to "Don't Walk".
          A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street.
          Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign. She
          looks down to see a little KITTEN. It rubs against her ankles
          and PURRS.

          STEPHANIE
          Well, you're a little cutie.

          

          

          

          

          2.
          A car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the
          intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming VAN.
          Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten
          and places it safely down on the other side of the street.

          STEPHANIE
          Hey! Slow down!
          The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks
          Stephanie's face. She sets it down.

          STEPHANIE
          Go on home. Shoo now!
          She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back,
          frowning.

          STEPHANIE
          Shoo!

          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA -- DAY

          Stephanie site at her desk, across from a young MEXICAN
          COUPLE. She studies their mortgage. application.

          MEXICAN MAN
          We keep getting the same thing.
          Because I'm not employed by an
          American company, they won't take
          my application until they get my
          solvency statement. And the Mexican
          Treasury Department says that's
          going to take at least four more
          weeks.

          MEXICAN WOMAN
          And the house will be gone by then.

          STEPHANIE
          It says, here your employed by
          Pemex?

          MEXICAN
          That's right.

          STEPHANIE
          Isn't Pemex a subsidiary of Union
          Oil?

          

          

          

          

          3.
          a MEXICAN MAN
           Yes. So? 0

          STEPHANIE
          So technically, your employer is an
          American company. I think we can
          make this work. I'll call you this
          afternoon and let you know.
          The happy couple shake Stephanie's hand and exit. ELLEN,
          Stephanie's pretty, twenty two year old, roommate, flops down
          into the seat across from her.

          ELLEN
          I need clarification on the shoe
          issue.

          STEPHANIE
          Okay...

          ELLEN
          First of all-- you know you've got
          the only perfect pair of black
          dress shoes in L.A. So was that a
          definite, irrevocable, "no way" or
          t just a rather not at this time, "no 
          way"?

          STEPHANIE
          It's an absolutely, positively,
          forget about the shoes already, "no
          way". They're my only good pair and
          I need them in good shape for
          tomorrow.

          ELLEN
          What's Up?

          STEPHANIE
          Dinner with Ray's parents.
          Ellen picks up a desktop photo: A shot of Stephanie and her
          handsome boyfriend, Ray, locked in an embrace, standing in
          the spray of a waterfall.

          ELLEN
          Ray's got a nice butt. Really tight

          AND---
          Stephanie takes back her photo.

          

          

          

          

          4.

          STEPHANIE
          1 --I know. Thanks.

          ELLEN
          He's a keeper. But I told you about
          his mom, she's another story. I
          used to waitress at her country
          club, and with her, it's all about
          what private school you went to and
          who you know. You still up for that
          promotion? That would help.
          Stephanie looks longingly to...

          THE VACANT OFFICE
          of the former Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The
          executive chair. Waiting to be filled.
          Stephanie turns back, pushing the thought away.

          STEPHANIE
          I'm not putting on a show. She'll
          either accept me for who I am or
          not.

          4

          ELLEN
          Are you reading self help books
          again?
          The Kitten peers out through Stephanie's partially opened
          desk drawer.

          ELLEN
          Hello there!
          Ellen reaches for the Kitty but Stephanie waves her off.

          STEPHANIE
          --Shhhl I can't let my boss see
          him.
          Stephanie glances to her manager, MR. JACKS, a heavyset man
          sitting behind a large desk.

          ELLEN
          What about the shoes?

          STEPHANIE
          I told you. No. Now beat it.

          

          

          

          

          5.
          Mr. Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose. He looks suspiciously about
          the bank for the source of his allergy. 0

          STEPHANIE
          Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty
          home for me.

          ELLEN
          Sure. If I can take the shoes.

          STEPHANIE
          I told you, no.
          Mr. Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water. He turns to his

          SECRETARY.

          MR. JACKS
          Has someone brought a damned animal
          into my bank?!
          Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading
          him toward Stephanie's desk.

          STEPHANIE
          Okay, fine! Take the shoes!

          
          Hidden from Mr. Jack's view, Ellen quickly scoops up the
          Kitten and places it into her purse.
          As Mr. Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears:

          ELLEN
          Just don't expect me to take care
          of it.
          This catches Mr. Jack's Attention. He turns to the ladies,
          wondering what they're talking about. Stephanie takes Ellen's
          hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye.

          STEPHANIE
          Of course not. I'll take care of
          everything. And thanks for choosing
          Bank of California.
          Ellen plays along.

          T

          

          

          

          

          6.

          ELLEN
          Okay. Then I'll see you later. I
          mean--- whenever the next time I'm
          in the bank. You know-- for a loan.

          OR--

          STEPHANIE
          Goodbye.
          As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks sneezes again, harder.

          MR. JACKS
          Someone has definitely brought an
          animal in here.
          He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits.

          STEPHANIE
          I don't see any cats. Or any
          animals.

          MR. JACKS
          Hope to hell, not.

          STEPHANIE
          By the way, I put the paperwork for
          the Mcpherson loan on your desk.

          MR. JACKS
          Mcpherson?

          STEPHANIE
          That big corporate loan I've been
          trying to set up? It's just
          preliminary but--

          MR. JACKS
          Oh, right. I'll look it over when I
          get the chance.

          STEPHANIE
          Mr. Jacks, I was wondering it you
          had made any decision regarding the
          Assistant Manager's position yet?

          MR. JACKS
          I'm still deciding. Right now it's
          between Stu and yourself.

          7.

          STEPHANIE 
          Stu? The trainee?
          Stephanie turns to see Stu, the balding loan officer who sits
          at his desk, watching, trying to figure out what Jacks is
          saying to her.

          MR. JACKS
          I know he's new but he's also quite
          aggressive and we like that. Don't
          get me wrong, you're well liked
          here, but we're also looking for
          someone who's not afraid to crunch
          the numbers and make the tough
          decisions.

          STEPHANIE
          Mr. Jacks, I feel that I'm
          perfectly capable of--

          MR. JACKS
          --I'll let you know as soon as,I
          decide. In the meantime, take him
          through our loan qualifying
          procedures... just in case.

          STEPHANIE
          Oh. okay.

          MR JACKS
          And would you mind taking your
          lunch now?

          STEPHANIE
          Sure.

          MR. JACKS
          And on your way back, maybe you
          could bring me a turkey club?
          Stu overhears them as he passes by.

          STU
          Turkey club. Excellent choice, J.J.
          Then to Stephanie:

          STU
          Mind picking one up for me?

          

          

          

          

          8.

          STEPHANIE
          No problem.
          Jacks heads back toward his desk. Stephanie grabs her purse
          and keys and as she heads out, Stu calls after her:

          STU
          On toasted rye! And spicy mustard!
          Stephanie doesn't like fetching lunch for the trainee but
          hides her displeasure.

          STEPHANIE
          Sure.

          EXT. UCLA - WESTWOOD CAMPUS - DAY

          Stephanie enters the Ivy-covered red bricked Department of
          Psychology Building.

          INT. UCLA LECTURE HALL - DAY

          RAY DALTON, a handsome twenty-nine year old man is lecturing
          before a class of UCLA students. They listen attentively.

          RAY
          The conscious mind abhors
          uncertainty. It seeks a pattern or
          reason for everything. When we
          can't find that pattern or reason,
          we sometimes ascribe it's cause to
          the world of the supernatural. The
          spiritual world is created by the
          human mind to conveniently explain
          everything we can't. So when does a
          belief in the supernatural cross
          into the field of abnormal
          behavior? Where do you, the
          Psychologist, come in? When these
          beliefs negatively affect our
          patients activities of daily
          living. Their jobs, their friends,
          their sense of well being--
          The class bell RINGS.

          RAY
          Tomorrow we'll be covering the
          clinical manifestations of
          psychosis. You'll find it all
          t referenced in the text.

          

          

          

          

          9.
          The students pack up their books. Ray smiles as he sees
          Stephanie enter the lecture hall, holding a bag of deli food.

          INT. RAY'S UNIVERSITY OFFICE - LATER

          Stephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement
          of the Mcpherson Corporation.
          Ray grades papers.

          RAY
          How're things at the bank? How's
          that new position looking?

          STEPHANIE
          I don't know.

          RAY
          Really? You sounded so sure.

          STEPHANIE
          Well, now there's this new guy...
          they're considering him too.
          Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close, taking her in 
          his arms.

          RAY
          That job needs somebody with your
          experience. They know that.
          Stephanie nods.

          STEPHANIE
          Oh, I've got something for you.
          She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He
          removes a coin. An old nickle.

          RAY
          A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find.
          Where'd you get it?

          STEPHANIE
          One of the tellers found it for me.
          Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into
          his pocket.

          

          

          

          

          10.

          RAY
          Thanks.

          STEPHANIE
          I'd better get back to work.
          She quickly gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his
          student's exams. The telephone RINGS. Ray hits the
          speakerphone.

          RAY.
          Doctor Dalton.
          It's the voice of an older woman, TRUDY.

          TRUDY ON SPEAKERPHONE
          Hello dear.

          RAY
          Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec?
          He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie:

          RAY
          I'll call you tonight.
          She kisses Ray and exits.

          INT. HALL OUTSIDE RAY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Stephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink.

          RAY'S VOICE
          Nothing much. Just had lunch with
          Stephanie. And trying to get these
          midterms graded--
          She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's
          speakerphone. She moves closer to Ray's office to eavesdrop:

          TRUDY'S VOICE
          --Stephanie? The one from the farm?

          RAY'S VOICE
          You know who she is. She's coming
          over for dinner tomorrow night to
          meet you and dad.

          0

          

          

          

          

          11.

          TRUDY'S VOICE

          
          Ray, I'm sure she's sweet, but she
          doesn't sound...

          RAY'S VOICE
          What?

          TRUDY'S VOICE
          I mean she's just a teller at some
          bank right? Raymond there's a
          reason that your father and I
          raised you in a certain way. We
          have expectations.

          RAY'S VOICE
          Please, mom, not this again--

          TRUDY'S VOICE
          I heard that Julie Kulick is
          looking for someone to play tennis
          with. You know she graduated Yale
          law with honors. I'm told she's
          quite a successful attorney now. I
          gave you her number but her mother
          says you never called.

          

          RAY'S VOICE
          Because I'm with Stephanie. I'm
          not looking for anybody else.

          TRUDY'S VOICE
          Would it kill you to--

          RAY'S VOICE
          --Mom. I have to go. See you
          tomorrow night. Okay? Bye.
          A downhearted Stephanie quietly exits.

          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - BREAK ROOM - DAY

          As Stephanie pours herself a cup of coffee, Stu and Mr. Jacks
          take the first bites of their sandwiches. Stu makes a face.
          He inspects the sandwich, shakes his head.

          STU
          (quietly to Mr. Jacks)
          She messed up my order.
          Stephanie heard that.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          STEPHANIE
          No I didn't, Stu.

          STU
          Steph, I said "no mayo".

          STEPHANIE
          You never said that.
          Stu rolls his eyes to Mr. Jacks.
          Stephanie caught Stu's look, but what can she do? She
          exits.

          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - LATER

          Stephanie sits at her desk, entering data into her computer.
          She glances across the bank to see Stu and Mr. Jacks emerging
          from the break room. Stu is about to return to his desk when
          he remembers something: he's got two tickets to a Dodger game
          that he can't use. Mr. Jacks happily accepts the tickets.
          Stephanie looks to the vacant office of the Assistant
          Manager. She can feel her promotion slipping away.

          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
          Stephanie looks to the source of the sound...
          A withered hand. An involuntary tremor causes it's yellowed
          fingernails to SCRATCH across the surface of Stephanie's
          desk...

          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
          The hand belongs to MRS. SYLVIA GANUSH, the aged woman who
          site across from Stephanie. She wears a.formal dress and hat
          from another era. The outfit is threadbare in spots but great
          care has been taken to maintain it.

          MRS. GANUSH
          (Hungarian accent)
          Will you help me?

          STEPHANIE
          Of course. What can I do for you?
          Mrs. Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen
          handkerchief, which she tucks back into her puree. She hands
          Stephanie a bunch of crumpled papers. Stephanie reviews them.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          STEPHANIE
          Mrs. "Ganush"?
          The old woman nods.

          STEPHANIE
          This is a delinquency notice... it
          says that the payment on your loan
          was due a number of months ago. And
          this other document... is a court
          order for repossession. The bank is
          informing you of their intent to
          repossess-your property at 325
          Brandon street, tomorrow.,

          MRS. GANUSH
          The trucks are there now. The men
          are packing all my things. Private
          things. Please, make them stop.
          This is my home for twenty years.
          And I make every payment until the
          sickness took my eye.
          Mrs. Ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye.
          Stephanie hides her revulsion.

          STEPHANIE
          Well... do you have the payment
          with you now?

          MRS. GANUSH
          I hope to get it soon. I just need
          a little more time.

          STEPHANIE
          I don't think my manager is going
          to extend you anymore credit. I'd
          like to help but...

          MRS. GANUSH
          Please. Won't you try?

          STEPHANIE
          Okay. Wait here.
          Stephanie stands and moves off. The Old Woman picks through a
          bowl of hard candies on Stephanie's desk.
          Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her
          without looking up from his work.

          1B

          

          

          

          

          14.

          MR. JACKS
          What's up?

          STEPHANIE
          I've got an elderly woman asking
          for an extension on her mortgage
          payment.. They're in the process of
          repossessing her home. She's on a
          fixed income and she's had some
          medical problems. I was wondering
          if we could give her a break.
          Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his
          bifocals, studies it.
          Stephanie glances over her shoulder.

          STEPHANIE'S P.O.V. - HER DESK
          Mrs. Ganush looks around to. make sure no one's watching, then
          tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse. She reaches.
          into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she
          wraps in her linen handkerchief.
          She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it
          with a wet SUCKING sound. The Old Woman's one good eye,
          wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat.

          MR. JACKS
          Apparently, we've already granted
          her two extensions. And you know
          on this type of foreclosure, the
          bank makes a sizable amount in
          fees.
          He hands her back the file.

          STEPHANIE
          It would mean I'd have to throw her
          out of her house.

          MR. JACKS
          Tough decision. Your call.
          He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies
          her. Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant
          Manager. The large oak desk. The thick carpet.
          She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his
          workstation.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          STEPHANIE
          I'll take care of it. 
          Stephanie returns to her desk.

          STEPHANIE
          Mrs. Ganush, another extension on
          the loan is out of the question.

          MRS. GANUSH
          What?

          STEPHANIE
          I'm sorry.

          MRS. GANUSH
          No. Please, it's my home... I'm
          begging you.

          STEPHANIE
          I tried to talk my boss into it but
          he just wouldn't approve.

          MRS. GANUSH
          But where will I live?

          
          Stephanie leafs through the loan documents. She finds a name.

          STEPHANIE
          Mrs. Ganush, you've given your
          granddaughter as a reference... It
          says here, she lives nearby...
          Wouldn't you be better off living
          with her?

          MRS. GANUSH
          I would not burden her.

          STEPHANIE
          Okay well, there's several fine
          "assisted living" facilities for
          the elderly.

          MRS GANUSH
          A nursing home? No. I will never
          live in one of those places1

          STEPHANIE
          Well, of course, that's your
          choice.

          

          

          

          

          

          16.

          MRS. GANUSH
          It's yours.

          STEPHANIE
          I'm sorry there's nothing I can do.
          Mrs. Ganush begins to sob.

          MRS. GANUSH
          I am proud woman, Miss Brown, and
          never have I begged for anything.
          But I will beg for you now. This
          one time. I humble myself before
          you.

          STEPHANIE
          That isn't necessary, please.
          Let's not make this personal. It's
          just the bank's policy. I'm really
          sorry Mrs. Ganush.
          Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly
          into a manila folder. she glances up but Mrs. Ganush is gone..
          Stephanie turns in her chair and is startled to see the old
          woman, kneeling before her. She clutches Stephanie's leg with
          her gnarled hands.

          MRS. GANUSH
          Have mercy on me.
          Stephanie stands, tries to pull free, but the old woman will
          not release her leg.

          STEPHANIE
          Please, let go.
          Customers turn to look. Mr. Jacks glances up from his desk.

          MR. JACKS
          What the hell?

          MRS. GANUSH
          I, Sylvia Ganush, beg. On my
          mother's grave, I beg you.

          STEPHANIE
          Please, take your hands off me.
          But the old woman only clutches tighter.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          STEPHANIE
          t 
          I'm calling security.
          She picks up the phone and presses a button.

          STEPHANIE
          (into the phone)
          Could you please come over?
          Mrs. Ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in
          humiliation.

          MRS. GANUSH
          You shame me.
          She composes herself. Then, slowly stands, puffing up her
          chest. Mu3tering her damaged pride.

          MRS. GANUSH
          I begged you...
          Her one. good eye fixes it's hardened gaze upon Stephanie.

          MRS. GANUSH
          .and you shame me.
          Mrs. Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanie's arm. Stephanie tries
          to pull away but the old lady's grip is strong. Mrs. Ganush
          reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from Stephanie's
          wrist-- but the Security Guard intervenes.

          SECURITY GUARD
          I think your business here is
          finished, ma'am.
          The Guard escorts Mrs. Ganush from the bank. Through the
          banks's window, Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs. Ganush
          to a old, Chevy Cavalier on the street.
          Stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up, the
          old woman's car is gone.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BANK - LATER

          16 The bank is closing. Stephanie is finishing some paper work
           when Mr. Jacks stops by her desk. 0

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MR. JACKS
          That was one nutty old lady. You
          okay?
          Stephanie nods.

          MR. JACKS
          You handled that just right. And by
          the way, as far as the Assistant
          Manager's position... You're at the
          top of the list.

          STEPHANIE
          Thanks.
          Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home. Stephanie loads a pile of
          contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box
          and exits the bank. The Security guard locks up behind her.

          EXT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Stephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off. It's
          then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler. It's parked
          in the structure.
          Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel.
          She nervously glances about. No sign of Mrs. Ganush.
          Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car.
          Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly
          than she would like.
          She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the
          doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat
          next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange
          sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the
          lot.
          It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief.
          It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer.
          Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her
          car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps
          up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is
          carried off by the wind.
          Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled
          hands come up around her face! Mrs Ganush sits up in the
          back seat of her car! SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie!

          19.

          MRS. GANUSH 
          (In Hungarian)
          You bitch! I pluck out your fucking
          eyes!
          Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards
          Stephanie's eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists,
          halting her.
          The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's
          throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically
          searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat
          next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and
          jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her
          grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before
          Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old
          woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over
          the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back
          of the front seat to pull even harder... Stephanie's neck is
          now bent so far back it's about to snap!
          Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It
          springs open. She swings it back over her shoulder!
          Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk!
          With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's
          forehead.
          Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled
          shut.
          The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only
          tightens.
          Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and
          hits the gas. As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her
          shoulder harness with the last of her strength.
          The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her
          to see... an oncoming concrete column.
          Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her
          shoulder harness.
          But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat,
          impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force.
          Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash. In
          a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth.

          

          

          

          

          20.
          Both women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her
          wits first. She reaches across Mrs. Ganush and opens the
          passenger door.
          Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's
          foot shoves her out. The old woman hits the ground hard but
          she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back
          in. Stephanie shifts the car into reverse. The opened
          passenger door knocks Mrs. Ganush back down to the pavement.
          The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column. Stephanie
          is dazed.
          Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the
          car.
          Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view
          mirror: Mrs. Ganush running closer,'SHRIEKING with old world
          rage!
          The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but
          Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time! Mrs. Ganush
          furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail.

          STEPHANIE
          I beat you, you old bitch! Next
          time take your Geretol!
          The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie
          looks about. Where'd she go?
          The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete
          and... CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters.
          The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her
          toothless maw down upon Stephanie.'s chin. Suckling it,
          gumming. The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy.
          Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away.
          Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth
          to Ste
          phanie's jaw.
          The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat.
          She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight. She
          GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at
          Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING!
          Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and
          shoves it down the old lady's throat. Mrs. Ganush gags,
          trying to retch up the ruler.

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Then Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old
          1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car.
          Stephanie hits the pavement. She shields her face with her
          hands, waiting, but the blow never comes. The old woman
          standing above her, WHEEZING.

          MRS. GANUSH
          You shamed me.
          The Old Woman reaches down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.'Ganush's
          gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of
          Stephanie's coat. She waves the button through the air, and
          breathes out a single word:

          MRS. GANUSH
          Lamia...
          Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over
          Stephanie. A cold wind makes her shiver.

          STEPHANIE
          What--? What are you doing?
          Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman
          1 moves it out of reach. 

          MRS. GANUSH
          You want it?
          Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles
          cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat
          pocket.

          MRS. GANUSH
          Soon it will be you, who comes
          begging to me. It begins tonight
          when you hear the cry.

          STEPHANIE
          What cry?

          MRS. GANUSH
          The Lamia. It's coming for you.
          A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She
          swats it away. Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She
          leans against the car for support. When she finally looks up,
          Mrs. Ganush is gone.

          

          

          

          

          

          22.

          INT. POLICE STATION - SARGENT'S DESK - NIGHT

          Stephanie and Ray have just finished filing a report with

          OFFICER NAIMARK.

          RAY
          What about a restraining order?

          OFFICER NAIMARK
          Well that's usually only something
          we do if there's a pattern of
          harassment. But like I said, we'll
          file a report and keep it on record
          in case you do have a continuing
          problem. But once we send an
          officer around to have a word with,
          her, I don't think she'll be
          bothering you again.

          STEPHANIE
          Thank you, you've been very
          helpful.

          EXT. VENTURA BLVD - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Stephanie and Ray eat ice cream cones as they walk past the
          shops.

          RAY
          I just thank God you're okay. You
          are okay, right?

          STEPHANIE
          I'm fine.
          Ray waits, sensing that there's more to it.

          RAY
          Your fine, but...

          STEPHANIE
          I-- It's just that I could have
          gotten her another extension. But I
          didn't.

          RAY
          Loo]. You said the bank had already
          granted her two extensions.

          RAY (cont'd)
          When you don't pay your mortgage
          you lose your house, what did she
          t expect? 

          STEPHANIE
          I guess.
          A breeze. She shivers. He wraps his arms around her
          protectively and after a moment, they walk on. Stephanie
          watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY.
          Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a
          storefront window. It reads: PSYCHIC.

          STEPHANIE
          Let's get our fortune's read!

          RAY
          You're kidding right?
          She cajoles a protesting Ray through the front door of the
          establishment.

          INT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT

          A tiny waiting room. A poster on the wall indicating the
          energy meridians of the human body. 

          RAY
          I just hope to God none of my
          students see me here. Five bucks
          says he's wearing a turban.
          A beaded curtain parts, revealing...
          Rham Jas, a small, dark skinned, fifty year old Indian man.
          He wears a plain black suit and a white turban. His
          inquisitive eyes evaluate the couple.

          RHAM JAS
          I am Rham Jas. Seer.

          STEPHANIE
          How do you do? I'm Stephanie Brown
          and this is Ray...

          RAY
          But you probably already knew that.
          Just kidding.
          Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile.

          

          

          

          

          24.

          RHAM JAS
          How can I help you?

          STEPHANIE
          We'd like to have our fortunes
          read. Can you do that? Read the
          future?

          RHAM JAS
          I have the ability to see certain
          energies... Sometimes these '
          energies are a foretoken of things
          to come. Sometimes not. Sixty
          dollars, please.

          RAY
          Sixty dollars? Isn't that a little
          steep for this kind of thing?

          RHAM JAS
          Then go. There are many who would
          claim to be seers. But they are
          not. Although you would pay them
          little... you would receive
          nothing. If you.are not serious,
          go.
          Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain.

          STEPHANIE
          Wait.
          She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off,
          handing Rham Jas a credit card.

          RHAM JAS
          Platinum card. Very good.
          He swipes Ray's card through the credit card machine.
          INT Rham Jas'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT
          A sparsely furnished, dimly lit room. The walls are lined
          with old books. Rham Jas stands before Stephanie and Ray, who
          sit at a card table. Stephanie giggles with excitement.

          STEPHANIE
          Sorry.
          Rham Jas smiles back.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          RHAM JAS
          That's quite all right. So, you
          wish to know something of your
          destiny. Very good. We shall see
          what the fates have in store.
          Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains.

          RAY
          Freud said destiny was not an act
          of fate but rather something
          created by our subconscious to
          control our conscious choices.

          RHAM JAS
          That is true. But... "We should not
          pretend to understand the world
          only by intellect."

          RAY
          Carl Jung...

          RHAM JAS
          Yes. From his treatise
          "Psychological types".

          
          Ray studies this strange man as he strikes a match and lights
          a candle. There's more to him than meets the eye. Ray brushes
          it off.

          RAY
          Jung-- the New Agers' favorite
          psychologist.

          RHAM JAS
          Because he wasn't afraid to bring
          God into the equation.
          Rham Jas takes a seat at the table, across from Stephanie.

          RHAM JAS
          Your hand, please.
          Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas. He closes his eyes
          and concentrates. Stephanie smiles excitedly to Ray, who
          raises a skeptical eyebrow.

          RHAM JAS
          You,work with money.

          STEPHANIE
          That's right! 4

          RHAM JAS
          But... you've lost something.

          STEPHANIE
          No. I don't think so.

          RHAM JAS
          No. No, you're right. Something's
          been taken from you.

          STEPHANIE
          No, I-
          Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns it, revealing the threads.
          that once held the button on her coat sleeve.

          RHAM JAS
          A button.

          STEPHANIE
          Well, yes! Some Old Woman...

          RAY
          Well anyone can see she lost a
          button. So what?

          STEPHANIE
          But Ray, it was very strange. At
          the bank today. The old woman...
          the one I told you about... she
          plucked the button right from my
          sleeve.

          RAY
          Why would she do that?

          RHAM JAS
          If you would please, both be quiet.
          Rham Jae concentrates, his eyelids flutter. Stephanie appears
          uneasy. The flame of the candle begins to flicker as a breeze
          sweeps through the room. The wind chimes TINKLE. Ray pulls
          his collar closed against the sudden chill in the air. Rham
          Jas's back stiffens.

          27.
          He releases Stephanie's hand and stands. He moves away from
          the table, uncomfortable. With a handkerchief,' he dabs
          perspiration from his brow.

          RHAM JAS
          I think that is enough for now.

          STEPHANIE
          Wait. You saw something. What?

          RHAM JAS
          I'm sorry. I'm tired and I see it's
          become quite late. Of course I will
          refund your money.

          STEPHANIE
          Tell me. Please.
          Rham Jas hesitates, then...

          RHAM JAS
          A bad spirit has come upon you.

          STEPHANIE
          How?

          RHAM JAS
          Did you blaspheme the dead while
          visiting a grave site?

          STEPHANIE
          No.

          RHAM JAS
          Do you play with Ouija board or
          confer with those who practice the
          black arts?

          RAY
          What is this?!

          STEPHANIE
          No. No, I didn't.

          RHAM JAS
          Then perhaps someone has cursed
          you.

          STEPHANIE
          Who? 0

          

          

          

          

          28.
          Rham Jas turns her wrist, exposing the loose threads on her
          coat sleeve.

          CLOSE ON THE THREADS
          where the brass button once was.

          EXT. HILLS OF SILVER LAKE -- NIGHT

          Ray and Stephanie cruise along the dark, winding hills. Ray
          looks over at Stephanie.

          STEPHANIE
          How did he know all that?

          RAY
          Know what? That you lost,a button?1
          He makes some good guesses, stirs
          you up, leaving you with a lot of
          questions. And conveniently, his
          business card. C'mon, he's a scam
          artist.

          STEPHANIE
          He didn't want the money. He tried
          to give the money back.

          RAY
          In the end, he took it, didn't he?

          STEPHANIE
          I guess so.

          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ray and Stephanie step from the car. They open a rusting iron
          gate, and walk up the hilly path to Stephanie's slightly
          funky Silver Lake rental house.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

          Ray and Stephanie step inside. The kitten PURRS around
          Stephanie's feet. Ray picks it up.

          RAY
          So this is him. Got a name?

          STEPHANIE
          Uh... just "Kitty" so far.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          She takes the cat from Ray, cuddles it.

          

          RAY
          Sure you don't want me to spend the
          night?

          STEPHANIE
          Don't tempt me. I've got to prep a
          presentation for the morning.

          RAY
          okay.
          Ray kisses her, opens the front door and exits. He calls back
          to her from his car:

          RAY
          Remember, dinner at my folk's
          house, tomorrow night. We're
          supposed to bring desert. I could
          pick something up?

          STEPHANIE
          No. I'm planning on baking my
          special cake.

          

          RAY
          Sounds good. Try not to stay up too
          late.
          Ray waves and steps into his car. Stephanie watches him drive
          off.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Stephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas,
          entering financial data into her laptop. An episode of
          "Desperate Housewives" plays in the background on TV. A
          baking timer CHIMES. Stephanie removes a beautifully browned
          cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool. Her
          roommate, ELLEN, comes down the stairs, snuggling the kitten.

          STEPHANIE
          Isn't he adorable?

          ELLEN
          Let's hope the landlord thinks so.
          She sets down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag. 0

          ELLEN

          T
          What about you? You going to be
          okay? You know, I don't have to go
          out tonight.

          STEPHANIE
          No, I'm fine. Have a good time.

          ELLEN
          Do I look great? Be honest.

          STEPHANIE.
          You look great.
          Ellen smiles, grabs her car keys and heads for the door.

          STEPHANIE
          But... Isn't that Marci's dress?

          ELLEN
          Yeah. And if she calls, tell her
          not to go bi-polar on me, I'll'get
          it back to her by tomorrow. Or the
          next day. Bye!
          Ellen exits.
          Stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake frosting.
          Through the kitchen window we can see Ellen walking down the
          path, toward the street. She steps through the iron gate,
          latching it closed behind her.

          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Ellen's car pulls away. The wind kicks up, whisking leaves
          about, as though something where moving up the path and
          toward the front gate of the house.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          An unsettling SHRIEK! what the hell was that? Stephanie sets
          down the measuring cup.
          She moves to the front door. Locks it.
          She looks out the kitchen window. The iron. gate is now open.
          It SHRIEKS as it swings back and forth in the wind.

          

          

          

          

          31.
          Suddenly, the latch gives way and the windows swing open!
          1 Wind sweeps through the kitchen, whipping dead leaves about.
          The hanging pans bang together! KLANG! KLANG!
          Stephanie forces the windows closed.
          The wind dies. The room grows eerily quiet.
          A car passes in the street below. It's headlights sweep
          across the house. The headlight beams throw moving shadows on
          the wall. Stephanie notices that one particular shadow is
          darker than the others. It becomes the silhouette of Mrs.
          Ganush, but there's no one in the room with her.
          The car passes and the shadows vanish.
          Sensing something, the Kitten arches it's back. Now Stephanie
          feels it. A presence. The light bulb begins to sputter.
          She holds her breath, listens.
          The floorboards CREAK. Something is walking towards her. She
          spins around, but there's nothing there. The SOUND of
          footsteps drawing closer.
          She backs against the wall, trembling.
          Suddenly Stephanie's face is struck by an invisible hand! She
          cries out. Her mouth is bleeding.
          She runs for the door. She's almost there. Her hand reaches
          for the knob, when something unseen picks her up. She SCREAMS
          as she is thrown against the wall. She falls to the floor.
          Lifting her head, she catches her own reflection in the

          WINDOW:
          In the reflection, as the light bulb flickers, we see a flash
          of ghostly hands that grope at her body. They reach up
          through the floor, and clutch at her legs, buttocks and
          breasts.

          STEPHANIE
          Get off me! Get off!
          The phantom hands vanish. Stephanie looks about, eyes wild.

          32.
          Stephanie is wearing Ray's overcoat atop her pajamas. She
          nervously paces the room. Ray hurries in, handing her a pack
          of frozen peas that she presses against her bloody lip.

          RAY
          So she came to your house? This is
          crazy. I'm calling that police
          officer.
          He begins to dial but Stephanie stops him.

          STEPHANIE
          Ray, you're not listening. It
          wasn't her. It was something that
          she sicked on me...

          RAY
          I don't understand.

          STEPHANIE
          I didn't tell you the whole story.
          That old woman... after she knocked
          me down, and pulled the button from
          my coat, she told me that...

          RAY
          What?

          STEPHANIE
          She said that something was coming
          for me... and it did.
          Ray stares at her with concern.

          INT. RAY'S HOUSE - LATER

          DOCTOR RANGIVERTZ, wearing jeans and a UCLA basketball
          sweatshirt, concludes his interview with Stephanie. He
          carries a small black medical bag as he steps from the living
          room to speak with Ray.

          DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ
          Ray, you were right to call me.
          Never a good idea to be personally
          involved with your patient.

          RAY
          What do you think?

          33.

          DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ
          1b Medically, she's fine. She's just 
          very distraught. She's displaying
          some paranoia and a sense of panic.
          Classic symptoms of a post
          traumatic stress disorder. Probably
          a result of being assaulted by that
          old woman.
          Doctor Rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it
          to Ray.

          RAY
          How worried should I be?

          DOCTOR RANGAVERTZ
          We'll have to wait and see.

          INT. RAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          'Stephanie lays peacefully in bed, almost asleep. A bottle of
          sedatives on the bedside table. Ray pulls up the blanket
          around her exposed shoulder. Stephanie sighs, turns to him.

          RAY
          How you doing?

          

          STEPHANIE
          Better now. At the time it just
          seemed so real. I'm so embarrassed.

          RAY
          Don't be, you had a terrible day
          and you.got a little wigged out. It
          happens.

          STEPHANIE
          po, what now, Doc?

          RAY
          I was gonna surprise you, but what
          the hell. I've been planning a
          little trip for us this week end.
          Saturday morning we're taking a
          train to Santa Barbara.

          STEPHANIE
          Really?

          

          

          

          

          34.

          RAY
          My family owns a cabin up there. In,
          the hills. Overlooking this little
          river. We'll light a fire, drink
          some champagne and screw our brains
          out.

          STEPHANIE
          You sure know how to talk to a
          girl.

          RAY
          It's a chance to just be together.
          Undisturbed. There's a lot of stuff
          I want to talk to you abqut but it
          never seems to be the right time.

          STEPHANIE
          Sounds nice.
          She draws in a deep breath and for the first time that
          evening, she looks at peace. Ray watches, her as she closes
          her eyes and drifts off to sleep.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. RAY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          .Tweeting birds and filtered sunlight streaming in through the
          window, awaken Stephanie. She stretches and looks to the
          empty pillow next to her. Ray is gone.
          She tries to fall back asleep, but the sound of a dripping
          faucet keeps her awake. Frustrated, she gets out of bed and
          steps into the bathroom.
          WITHERED HANDS clamp around Stephanie's throat, violently
          SHAKING her!

          MRS GANUSH
          You shamed mel
          MATCH CUT to:
          Ray SHAKING her!

          She awakens in her bed, SCREAMING!

          STEPHANIE
          Oh my God: Oh Godl

          RAY
          It was just a dream. It's okay.
          She gets control. Ray smooths out the tangled hair from her
          sweaty face. He looks deeply into her eyes, afraid of what's
          happening to her. The phone in the next room, RINGS.'Ray
          looks over, decides to ignore it. It keeps RINGING.

          STEPHANIE
          Go ahead.

          RAY
          I'll be right back.
          He steps into the next room and we hear him answer the phone.
          Stephanie sighs and lays back down... next to Mrs. Ganush!
          The Old Woman is covered in.a swarm of BLACK FLIES! Stephanie

          SHRIEKS!
          The Old Woman opens her maw, exposing sharp broken teeth. She
          lunges for Stephanie! 
          Stephanie grabs the old woman by her hair, halting the
          chomping teeth inches from her face. She tries to push Mrs.
          Ganush away.
          But the Old Woman's yellowed teeth SNAP and press ever
          closer.
          The muscles in Stephanie's arms are trembling. She is
          weakening. Mrs. Ganush, closes in, about to clamp her teeth
          down upon Stephanie's face when--
          Stephanie suddenly awakens with a GASP. It was all a dream
          within a dream.
          She bolts up out of bed. Takes her bearings. She's alone in
          Ray's bedroom. She checks the bathroom. Under the bed. All
          normal.
          Ray enters.

          RAY
          You, okay?

          STEPHANIE
          No. No-- Oh my God. I had some 4
          dreams. Awful.

          RAY
          Want to tell me about them?

          STEPHANIE
          The old lady. She was here... I
          couldn't wake up.
          Stephanie shakes her head. She can't finish.
          Ray pulls back the drapes. Sunlight pours into the room.
          Stephanie tries to put the dream out of her mind. Ray sits
          next to her, strokes her hair.

          RAY
          Doctor Rangervertz said you could
          stop by his office during your
          lunch hour.
          Stephanie nods.

          EXT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - MORNING

          Ray's car stops in front of the Bank.

          INT. RAY'S CAR

          Stephanie looks across the street to the parking structure.
          Her car is there. The window has been replaced.

          RAY
          I had them replace the window last
          night. Still needs some body work.

          STEPHANIE-
          Thank you, Ray.
          She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.

          RAY
          We've got to be prepared that it
          might take some time for you to get
          over this.
          She nods.

          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA -- DAY 4


          

          

          

          

          37.
          Stephanie enters the bank. She guilty glancep to the clock.
          It's 9:40. She's late. She tries to be discreet as she
          moves to her desk, hoping Mr. Jacks won't notice. She's
          almost there when Stu Rubin "accidently" knocks a note book
          off his desk.
          Mr. Jacks glances up and notes Stephanie's tardiness.
          Stu approaches Stephanie's desk.

          STU RUBIN
          Hi Steph. Just getting here?

          STEPHANIE
          What are you, the hall monitor?

          STU RUBIN
          Ha ha! You're funny, Steph.

          STEPHANIE
          What do you want?

          STU RUBIN
          I need you to finish teaching me
          the loan procedures.

          T

          STEPHANIE
          I've got a lot on my mind. Let's do
          it tomorrow.

          STU RUBIN
          Sure. I'll just tell Mr. Jacks that
          you don't have the time right now.
          Maybe he can show me.
          She glances up. Mr. Jacks'is still watching her.

          STEPHANIE
          No, no, that's all right. I'll do
          it. Where were we?

          STU RUBIN
          We were going over the asset-based
          lending guidelines.

          STEPHANIE
          Right. Okay. Let's say your client
          is a company that can't get
          traditional bank financing but
          10 needs a secured loan. We offer-- 

          

          

          

          

          38.

          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
          Stephanie looks around for the source of the sound, but can't
          find it.

          STU
          Yeah?

          STEPHANIE
          .uh, we offer several types of
          asset-based lending which consist
          of revolving lines of credit and
          term loans secured by accounts
          receivables, their inventory,
          machinery-- ,

          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
          Stephanie sees...
          That Stu's hand has been replaced by MRS. GANUSH'S... it's
          yellowed fingernails SCRATCH across her desk. She looks again,
          and Stu's hand has returned to normal.

          STU
          ---and?

          STEPHANIE
          (in her full Missouri twang)
          --And get your filthy pig knuckle
          off my desk!
          Stu is taken aback by Stephanie's outburst. He retreats to
          his desk in confusion.
          Stephanie sits, rattled. A drop of blood falls onto a piece
          of paper on her desk. The blood is trickling from her nose.
          Stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding. She looks
          down to see a large black fly land upon the drop of blood.
          She gasps and stands, her mind racing. She knows what she
          must do. She finds Mrs. Ganush's loan documents. She stuffs
          them into a folder, grabs her purse and bolts for the exit.
          Mr. Jacks engaged with a customer, calls after her:

          MR. JACKS
          Stephanie? Where are you going?
          She moves quickly out the door, pretending not to hear him.

          Stu watches Stephanie go and gets up from his desk. She's 
          left some files behind. He snoops around his desk. He notices
          a folder marked CONFIDENTIAL. It's the McPherson loan file.
          Interesting. He picks it up.

          EXT. MRS. GANUSH'S HOUSE - DAY

          An old, wood bungalow that has seen better days. A MOVING
          TRUCK in the driveway.
          Stephanie's car pulls up. she steps out, carrying Mrs.
          Ganush's loan documents.
          She passes the MOVING MEN who load the last of Mrs. Ganush's
          things.
          She arrives at the opened front door, gathers her courage and
          KNOCKS. No answer. She calls out:

          STEPHANIE
          Mrs. Ganush?
          No answer. She steps inside.

          INT. MRS GANUSH'S FOYER - DAY

          It's dark and musty here. The place is barren but for some
          flattened cardboard boxes. Stephanie tries the light switch.
          No Power.

          STEPHANIE
          Mrs. Ganush? '
          She moves forward into the living room.

          INT. MRS. GANUSH'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Its too dark to see much of anything. Stephanie stumbles over
          something left on the floor. A voice:

          MRS. GANUSH
          I knew you'd come.
          Stephanie almost jumps out of her skin. As her eyes adjust
          she sees Mrs. Ganush sitting on a crate in the corner of the
          room. Her arthritic hands clutching a yellowed photograph.

          STEPHANIE
          Hi. I'm here because I think I can
          help you. I can get your house back
          for you.

          MRS. GANUSH
          It's so empty now.

          STEPHANIE .
          I can arrange for all your
          furniture to be brought back. Would
          that be okay?
          Mrs Ganush does not look up from the photograph.

          STEPHANIE
          So... on behalf of the bank I just
          want to resolve this to your
          satisfaction. This whole thing got
          personal and there was really no
          reason for that. The bank made a
          mistake and I can fix it for you
          and in return I'd like you to-
          cancel or call off, whatever you...
          you know-- that thing you did to
          me. Okay? No hard feelings. So...

          STEPHANIE
          My mother was a proud woman.
          Dignity. That's what she had.
          Stephanie nods. Waits an appropriate moment, then: places the
          document gently down on the floor next to Mrs. Ganush.

          STEPHANIE
          All you need to do is. sign here...
          Stephanie offers her a pen.

          STEPHANIE
          .and I'll take care of the rest.
          Mrs. Ganush's hard eyes find Stephanie's. They bore in.

          MRS. GANUSH
          No.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          STEPHANIE

          1 
          No? But... I'm saying I'll make
          things right. Just sign this and
          you can keep the house. Isn't that
          what you wanted?

          MRS. GANUSH
          It was what I wanted before you
          shamed me. Now I want to see you
          suffer.

          STEPHANIE
          Please! I've suffered enough!

          MRS GANUSH
          Not yet!
          Mrs. Ganush suddenly erupts in a broken toothed CACKLE.

          STEPHANIE
          You're insane! Just... just a crazy
          old woman! I don't even know why I
          came here!

          1 MRS. GANUSH 
          You know why.
          Terrified, Stephanie runs from the place.

          EXT. MRS. GANUSH'S HOUSE - DAY

          The Old Woman's CACKLING can still be heard as Stephanie
          hurries to her car and drives off.

          EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN PARKING LOT - LATER

          Stephanie site in her parked car.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR

          Stephanie is eating from a package of DOUBLE STUFF OREOS,
          joylessly jamming one after another into her mouth. Her eyes
          dart about: Who could help her? Then she remembers
          something. She sets down the cookies and rummages through
          her purse. She finds the business card of Rham Jas. She
          starts the car and drives off.

          EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

          42.
          Stephanie halts at a red light. out of the corner of her eye
          she sees something odd.

          STEPHANIE'S POV - ON THE STREET
          Stu Rubin walking with two well dressed executives.

          STEPHANIE
          Stu?
          The men warmly escort into the First National Bank.

          STEPHANIE
          What's he doing at First National?
          The car behind her HONKS! She drives on.

          EXT. RHAM JAS' STOREFRONT - DAY

          Stephanie's car is parked in the street.

          INT. STOREFRONT - DAY

          Stephanie stands before a counter facing Rham Jas. He swipes
          her credit card through the machine.
          She signs the receipt. He motions for her to follow him
          through the beaded curtain.
          INT. BACK ROOM OF RHAM Jas'S STOREFRONT - DAY
          on a plain wooden table.a samovar brews a musty tea. Rham Jas
          is reading from an ancient text. He looks up from the book,-
          solemn.

          RHAM JAS
          What did it sound like.

          STEPHANIE
          Like... shrieking. It was awful.
          He nods. Closes the book.

          RHAM JAS
          That would be the Lamia. The "Black
          Goat".

          4

          

          

          

          

          43.

          STEPHANIE
          Lamia. Right. That's the word the 
          old woman used.

          RHAM JAS
          It is a nasty spirit. A taker of
          souls. A creature of misfortune for
          you and those around you. It is
          often summoned by the Gypsies for
          their dour deeds. On the third day
          the Lamia comes for the owner of
          the accursed object.

          STEPHANIE
          Accursed object? What object?

          RHAM JAS
          Something that the old woman took
          from you, cursed, then gave back.
          Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the threads on her
          coat.

          STEPHANIE
          The button...

          
          Stephanie's hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket. The
          thin brass button in her palm.

          STEPHANIE
          .this?
          She holds the button up for him to inspect. But it's presence
          makes him uneasy..He wags his finger back and forth. She
          lowers it.

          STEPHANIE
          What if I just burn the thing?

          RHAM JAS
          No matter what condition the button
          is in, you would still be the
          owner. The Lamia would still come
          to take you.

          STEPHANIE
          Take me where?

          NO

          

          

          

          

          44.
          Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text. She
          knows where. Stymied, she tucks the button back into her coat
          pocket.

          STEPHANIE
          There's got to be something I can
          do.

          RHAM JAS
          Yes. There are many ways to appease
          a spirit. The simplest is a blood
          offering. An animal sacrifice. A
          small creature would do. You could
          sacrifice a chicken. It's all in
          here...
          Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he
          sets before her.

          STEPHANIE
          No way. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a
          member of PETA, for Christ's sake.
          I don't go around killing animals.

          RHAM JAS
          You will be surprised what you will
          be willing to do when the Lamia
          comes for you.
          She considers his words, looks down to the book.
          CLOSE ON A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL SACRIFICE - A creature's
          heart being cut from it's body.
          CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her
          kitchen table, reading the book. We see other diagrams: The
          heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire. The
          burial of the smoking heart. Stephanie's kitten PURRS, as it
          rubs against her leg.
          Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing
          images.
          She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to
          the window and peers out. The rusting iron gate is open.
          Stephanie senses a change in the room... Shadows shift and
          grow deeper. The air is suddenly oppressive. Something is
          coming.

          

          

          

          

          45.
          She moves to the front door and puts her ear to it. Quiet.
          1b But then--

          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...
          She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM

          She can hear the sound of the SCRATCHING, even here.,
          She rushes to the phone picks it up: No dial tone, only high
          pitched static, the sounds of the Lamia buried within.
          She sets the phone down.
          For a moment all is quiet. Should she go back down? Then she
          hears a tiny SQUEAKING. The knob on the front door, turning.
          Then the CLICK of the lock, followed by the CREAKING of rusty
          hinges as the front door swings open. She calls through her
          bedroom door.

          STEPHANIE
          Ellen? !
          But it's not Ellen. 
          Stephanie puts her,ear to the door. The sound of an animal's
          hooves on wood. Something is climbing the stairs. It stops
          outside her bedroom door.
          Stephanie holds her breath, listening.
          She sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door.

          STEPHANIE
          I know that you're there!
          The window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening

          ROAR!
          She ducks for cover. Another window is blown inward and the
          glass sent her way. She SCREAMS and runs toward the bathroom
          door. It SLAMS shut in her face!
          BOOM! Another window is SHATTERED by the angry, unseen thing.
          The force knocks her to the bed. The blankets are torn from
          the mattress, throwing Stephanie to the floor. The bedsheets
          whisk around the room, flapping and twisting about like
          1b drunken ghosts. 

          

          

          

          

          46.
          She tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank her
          into the air, suspending her upside down, taking her on a
          wild and harrowing ride about the room.
          Abruptly all the madness halts: She drops to the floor. The
          bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her. Whatever it was,
          .it's gone. It's quiet now. A terrified Stephanie sits,
          shaking, in the wreckage of her room.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - LATER

          With a trembling hand, she jams a ZAGNUT BAR into her mouth,
          and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor.
          She chases it with a double shot of Maker's Mark Whiskey. She
          removes a knife from the butcher block and hefts. it's weight.
          She sings out, in a sweet but trembling voice.

          STEPHANIE
          Here kitty-kitty... Here, kitty-
          kitty-kitty...
          She moves closer until her face fills the screen.

          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - DAY

          The distant SCREAM of the kitten is heard. We hear it again
          and again until it is finally silenced. 4

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Stephanie having been sick, emerges from the bathroom, wiping
          her mouth.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN -DAY

          Stephanie throws something small and bloody inside the
          microwave oven and turns it on.

          STEPHANIE'S BACKYARD GARDEN AFTERNOON
          She buries the heart in a corner of her garden.
          She turns on the garden hose, washing the cat's blood from
          the knife.

          ELLEN'S VOICE
          Steph?
          Stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes. Ellen
          appears.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          ELLEN
          t 
          Didn't you hear me calling? I was
          looking all over for you. Are you
          power eating Clark bars again?
          'Cause there's about ten thousand
          wrappers all over the-- Oh my God,
          is that blood?1
          Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden. But
          no blood shows.

          STEPHANIE
          No. Why would there be blood?

          ELLEN
          Right there, on your sleeve.
          Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve.

          STEPHANIE
          That's just tomato juice. I was
          inside making a salad and... I cut
          a tomato and I must have gotten it
          on my sleeve.
          Ellen gives her roommate a worried look.

          ELLEN
          Look, Steph, we're friends so if
          something's wrong...

          STEPHANIE
          I had some problems. A situation.
          But I think everything is going to
          be good now.
          Ellen isn't so sure.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Stephanie closes her bedroom door so Ellen can't see the
          damage. Stephanie cleans up the place. As she picks up some
          of her things, she comes across an old photograph.
          CLOSER: It's a photo of 16 year old Stephanie. She was
          obese. Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a "4-
          H" tee shirt. She stands before some barnyard animals, a
          bucket of feed in her hand.

          

          

          

          

          48.
          Stephanie looks distastefully down at her former self. She
          tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket.

          INT. KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

          The music grows lighter as Stephanie models a couple of
          dresses in front of Ellen, who's helping decide on the
          evening's wardrobe.

          ELLEN
          Go with the short skirt.

          STEPHANIE
          What about this one?
          She hold up a longer, more formal dress.

          ELLEN
          Uh uh. That one's saying "I'm
          trying to impress you with my
          conservative taste."

          STEPHANIE
          But that's what I want it to say.
          Ellen shakes her head, no. Stephanie takes a last look in the
          mirror, decides to go with the short skirt.

          STEPHANIE
          Okay. This is it.

          ELLEN
          Tell me again... the exact words he
          used.

          STEPHANIE
          Just that this little cabin would
          be a great place for us to really
          connect and that there was
          something he'd been meaning to talk
          about with me.

          ELLEN
          Oh my god, you are so engaged!
          Ellen's smile fades. She shakes her head despondently.

          STEPHANIE
          What's wrong? I

          

          

          

          

          49.

          ELLEN
          t 
          I just know that Rob's never going
          to ask me.

          STEPHANIE
          But I thought you said that
          relationship was only physical.

          ELLEN
          Oh, I'd never marry a guy like
          that... but I'd still like him to
          ask me.

          STEPHANIE
          Huh.

          EXT. NICHOLAS CANYON - DUSK

          Stephanie's car pulling up in front of Ray's hillside house.
          The convertible top is down and Stephanie looks radiant in
          the golden sunlight.

          RAY'S VOICE
          Let's get a look at that dress.
          She steps from the car and models the dress. S

          STEPHANIE

          RAY
          I like.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR - DUSK


          RAY AND STEPHANIE
          drive through the streets of Bel Air, Stephanie at the wheel.
          She tunes in a rock station and turns it up loud. She smiles
          at Ray and takes his hand.
          She hits the gas and her Ford Focus opens up, accelerating
          down a long, tree lined street, the wind blowing through
          their hair.

          EXT. DALTON HOUSE - DUSK

          Stephanie and Ray approach the front door. Stephanie carries
          her home made cake. They ring the bell. Stephanie suddenly
          seems apprehensive. 

          

          

          

          

          50.

          RAY
          Something wrong?

          STEPHANIE
          It's just that I'm not, some ivy
          leaguer with an impressive resume.
          I have a feeling that's what your
          folks really want.

          RAY
          Maybe. But in the end, it's about
          what you and I want.

          STEPHANIE
          Is that so?
          Ray gives her a reassuring nod.
          The front door opens revealing Ray's parents, GEORGE AND
          TRUDY DALTON. Behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished
          foyer.

          TRUDY

          She kisses her son.

          RAY
          Stephanie, this is my mother,
          Trudy, and my Father, George.
          Trudy glances at Stephanie's revealing cocktail dress with
          thinly veiled disapproval. Stephanie self-consciously tugs it
          lower.

          TRUDY
          How do you do?

          GEORGE
          Nice tp meet you, Stephanie.

          STEPHANIE
          It's very nice to meet you, too.

          GEORGE
          Please, come in.

          You have a lovely home.

          GEORGE
          Thanks. I'll get us something to
          drink.
          As George exits, Stephanie presents her home made cake to
          Trudy.

          STEPHANIE
          I hope you don't mind. I baked
          something for you.
          Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie.

          TRUDY
          It's lovely. Homemade.

          STEPHANIE
          It's a harvest cake.

          

          TRUDY
          Harvest cake? Is'that some kind of
          cake you make on a... farm?

          STEPHANIE
          We used to, yeah, when you have a
          lot of extra duck eggs. Especially
          right before spring; that's when
          you get a real dense yolk. Makes
          for, rich cake.
          The mother forces a smile.

          TRUDY
          You must give me the recipe
          sometime.

          STEPHANIE
          Sure. It's easy. The real
          secret's in the milk. You want it
          unpasteurized.

          Unclean... Uh... I mean
          "unpasteurized"? Is that safe?

          STEPHANIE
          Uh huh. And you want that milk
          still warm. Straight from the cow.
          Trudy has to stifle her gag reflex. George returns and hands
          Ray and Stephanie a cocktail.

          TRUDY
          Excuse me while I go find someplace
          to put this.
          As Trudy takes away the cake, a cat rounds the corner. It
          HISSES at Stephanie. She takes a step back.

          GEORGE
          Never could understand that damned
          animal. Hate cats.
          Trudy returns from the kitchen.

          TRUDY
          That's strange. Hecuba's usually
          very sweet.

          STEPHANIE
          That's okay. I had a cat. I
          understand.

          RAY
          What do you mean "had a cat"? What
          happened to him?

          STEPHANIE
          How would I know what happened?
          Probably nothing. You know how cats
          are. They come and they go.
          Ray nods slowly. About to say something but let's it go.

          INT. DALTON HOUSE - DINNING ROOM - LATER

          Stephanie, Ray, George and Trudy are finishing dinner.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          GEORGE
           Still keeping up with your coin 
           collection, Ray?

           RAY
           I try to. In fact Stephanie just
          found me a 1925 Indian Head nickel
          at her bank.

          GEORGE
          Really? So, how long have you been
          working there, Stephanie?

          STEPHANIE
          Almost two years now.

          TRUDY
          The job of a bank teller must be so
          difficult. I'd think with all the
          counting and the repetition, it'd
          become so tedious.

          STEPHANIE
          Yes, you're right. But I'm not a
          teller.

          

          TRUDY
          Oh?

          RAY
          Stephanie's a loan officer in
          charge of small business and home
          loans. And she's on a fast track
          for a promotion. Right, Steph?

          STEPHANIE
          I'd like to think so... actually,
          It depends. If I could close this
          big account that I'm working on, it
          would really help.

          GEORGE
          Must be a very important loan.

          STEPHANIE
          It would be the biggest that my
          branch has ever handled.

          GEORGE
          How''d it come to you?

          

          

          

          

          

          54.

          STEPHANIE
          Well, I was reading the Wall Street
          Journal and found this innovative
          medical supply company that was
          interested in expanding but didn't
          have the liquidity. I met with
          their CFO and presented a formula
          for restructuring-some of their
          long term debt. It created an
          environment where I was able to
          offer them a rather attractive loan

          PACKAGE

          GEORGE
          You sure sound like you've got a
          lot going for you, Stephanie.

          TRUDY
          Your mother must be very proud.

          STEPHANIE
          I suppose. I don't see her much.

          TRUDY
          Why is that?

          STEPHANIE
          Well, ever since my dad died she
          doesn't talk much. She mostly stays
          on the farm and... keeps to
          herself. Because...
          There is an awkward silence.

          TRUDY
          Does your mother have a drinking
          problem?

          RAY
          Cut her some slack, mom, she--

          STEPHANIE
          Yes. I'm afraid she does.

          TRUDY
          I'm sorry. It's nothing to be
          ashamed of. And I find your honesty
          refreshing.

          STEPHANIE
          Thank you.

          

          

          

          

          5.5 .

          TRUDY
          t 
          You've got back bone. Not like that
          other girl Ray brought by... What
          was her name? Alicia? She was
          dreadful. So ill-mannered. And no
          ambition.

          RAY

          MOM-

          TRUDY
          (stage whisper to

          STEPHANIE)
          He found her through the,internet.

          RAY
          Mors, please.

          TRUDY
          Stephanie, am I being too tough on
          Ray?
          Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at
          Ray.

          STEPHANIE
          No. Not at all. That's what mom's
          are for.

          TRUDY
          Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will
          try that Harvest cake of yours,
          after all.
          Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and
          emits a tiny cough.

          STEPHANIE
          Excuse me.
          She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger.

          STEPHANIE
          Just a little tickle in my--
          She stands and takes a few steps away from the table. Ray
          looks on concerned.

          RAY
          Are you okay?

          

          

          

          

          56.
          She waves him off, clearing her throat. Tries to smile
          demurely, but erupts with a harsh cough. She's choking on
          something and is trying to bring it up from deep within her
          throat. With all her might she emits a BARK and a large
          black fly buzzes out of her mouth.

          TRUDY
          Oh! OH MY GOD!
          The fly lazily BUZZES across the table, slowly circling
          Trudy's head.
          Trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin.
          George lowers his fork and pushes away his plate of unclean
          farm cake.
          Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak.
          Stephanie's gaze shifts to the kitchen door. From The other
          side, she hears the sound of a hoofs.
          Ray tries to cover for Stephanie:

          RAY
          I'm so sorry, Stephanie. I don't
          know how that fly got. into your--

          STEPHANIE
          --Wait. What's that sound?

          TRUDY
          What sound-?

          STEPHANIE
          SHHH! Listen!
          Trudy listens along with the others. They can't hear
          anything. But Stephanie hears the FOOTSTEPS drawing closer.

          TRUDY
          I'm sorry, I can't hear anything.

          STEPHANIE
          (mutters under her breath)
          Must be deafer than a post!
          But Trudy heard that and takes offense. But before she can
          say anything, a SHADOW appears at the base of the door.
          Stephanie stands and shouts at it:

          

          

          

          

          57.

          STEPHANIE

          T
          Leave me alone! Just leave me the
          fuck alone!
          Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past
          Trudy's head. It shatters against the base of the door,
          spraying everyone with bits of broken china and fish. The
          shadow and FOOTSTEPS are gone.
          Ray rushes to her side.

          RAY
          Steph, it's okay! There's nothing
          there.
          She looks about. George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she
          were mad.

          STEPHANIE
          I... I think I'd better go.

          TRUDY
          I think that's best, dear.
          She heads for the door. Ray starts to go after her but his

          
          mother stops him.

          TRUDY
          Let her go, Ray. She's a sick girl.

          RAY
          She needs me.
          Trudy grabs Ray's arm.

          TRUDY
          I'm telling you not to go after
          her.
          Ray gently pulls free of his mother's grasp and chases after
          Stephanie.

          EXT. DALTON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Ray rushes outside stopping Stephanie as she is about to get
          into her car.

          RAY
          What did you see in there?

          

          

          

          

          58.

          STEPHANIE

          4
          You don't want to know.
          Ray pulls her close.

          RAY
          Tell me!

          STEPHANIE
          The thing that's coming for me.
          What the old woman sent.

          RAY
          Listen to me. What you're going
          through right now-- It's like the
          doctor said, it's a stress reaction
          and --

          STEPHANIE
          No. I wanted to believe that-- but
          it's real, Ray. You just don't want
          to open your eyes to it because it
          threatens you. Because if I'm right
          and there is something out there,
          then you'd have to throw out
          everything you teach. And where'd
          that leave you? Like a plow without
          a mule.
          Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if
          maybe she isn't right.

          STEPHANIE
          Unless you're willing to take a
          chance and believe in me, I can't
          be with you any more.
          She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail
          lights, as they vanish into the night.

          EXT. ECHO PARK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          An older home with bars on the front windows. Stephanie
          knocks at the front door.
          She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched
          SQUEAL. Was it just a bus's air brakes... or something more?
          When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack.
          An EYE peers out at her.

          

          

          

          

          59.

          VOICE OF THE EYE
          What is it?

          STEPHANIE
          Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia
          Ganush. Is she here?
          The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old
          Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long
          black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck. She
          wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts.
          EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from within
          the house.

          ILENKA
          I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter.
          Who are you?

          STEPHANIE
          Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of...
          a friend of hers. Actually, I've
          been trying to help her with a loan

          THAT-

          ILENKA
          Wait. I know who you are. Grandma
          told me you'd come. You're the
          woman from the bank. The one who
          took her house.

          STEPHANIE
          It was really the bank that took
          the house. I just work there. In
          fact, I tried to help your grandma
          get-the house back, but my boss
          wouldn't let me.
          Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows.

          ILENKA
          That's not what happened, is it?
          Are you going to stand here on my
          porch and lie to my face?

          STEPHANIE
          . no.

          ILENKA
          You used to be a real fat girl,
          to didn't you?

          

          

          

          

          60.

          STEPHANIE
          Yes.

          ILENKA
          I can tell. You know, you caused my
          grandma a lot of pain. That house
          was her pride. When you took that
          from her, she had nothing left.
          You're not welcome here.
          She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate
          now, no where else to turn.

          STEPHANIE
          Okay! I did it. It was me who
          denied her the loan. I was trying,
          to get ahead at work and I
          shouldn't have done it. It was
          wrong.

          ILENKA
          Damn straight it was wrong.

          STEPHANIE
          And I'm ashamed about it. And I'm
          going to get down on my hands and
          knees and beg her to forgive me.
          She said-that I hadn't suffered
          enough. But now I think she'll see
          that I have and then maybe she'll
          let me...

          ILENKA
          .make everything all right for
          her, is that it?

          STEPHANIE
          Yes.
          Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile. She motions for
          Stephanie to follow. They enter a room filled with young
          Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic
          tongue.
          A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A
          Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad
          luck as he pays cash to the woman.

          ' STEPHANIE
          Where is she?

          

          

          

          

          61.
          Ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers. Stephanie
          t pushes her way through the crowd. She stumbles and falls atop 
          the Corpse of Mrs. Ganush!
          As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just
          her dead body that rests atop a coffee table.
          Stephanie has landed atop the corpse! The leg of the coffee
          table breaks under the weight of the two women. Stephanie
          tumbles to the ground, the corpse landing atop her. The crowd
          of mourners GASP.
          The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon
          Stephanie's chin, as through it were once again suckling it.
          Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in
          revulsion.

          ILENKA
          Still going to make everything all
          right?
          The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table.
          Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian. She tells them that
          it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother
          t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia. 
          A mother shields her daughter's eyes from the sight of
          Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her
          .crucifix. A man spits at her feet then walks off.

          STEPHANIE
          No, please-- I needed her to take
          this thing off me.

          ILENKA
          It will never come off.

          STEPHANIE
          You know about it? Then, please
          help me. I'm begging you.

          ILENKA
          She said you'd come begging. I only
          wish she could have lived to see
          it.
          The blood drains from Stephanie's face.

          

          

          

          

          62.

          ILENKA
          .maybe she can...
          Stephanie glances down to the corpse. It's head is now
          facing her. It's dead eyes, OPEN!

          INT. RHAM JAS' HOUSE -- NIGHT

          Stephanie puts her foot through RHAM Jas' TV set. Shattering
          the tube, commanding his. attention.

          STEPHANIE
          Fuck that! I paid you a hundred and
          seventy nine dollars for that book!

          RHAM JAS
          It was a limited printing! Please
          control yourself!

          STEPHANIE
          I did what you said- that blood
          offering... I killed that little
          kitty deader than Hogan's goat.
          Lotta good that did me.

          RHAM JAS
          We are dealing with elusive and
          powerful forces. There are no
          guarantees.
          She wants to shout, but instead, closes her eyes and sits.

          STEPHANIE
          Just tell me what to do.
          Rham Jas considers. A dark look crosses his face. Stephanie
          tries to read his expression.

          CLOSE ON STEPHANIE'S MASTERCARD
          It's run through the carbon paper. Rham Jas hand her a
          receipt. She signs it. He sits.

          RHAM JAS
          We must somehow dissuade the spirit
          from taking your soul.

          STEPHANIE
          How?

          

          

          

          

          63.

          RHAM JAS
          1 A seance. And it should be soon. 
          For tomorrow will be the third
          night...

          STEPHANIE
          Have you done this before?

          RHAM JAS
          No. But I know someone. I can
          arrange what is necessary, but you
          must understand that everyone
          involved in this would be taking a
          great risk with their lives.

          STEPHANIE
          What would you need from me?
          Rham Jas thinks for a moment, weighing the dangers. He pulls
          out a pipe and packs it with tobacco. He tamps it down and
          lights up.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Stephanie is hastily piling all her valuables atop her bed:
          sporting equipment, TV, VCR/DVD COMBO, CD player, IPOD, Etc.
          Ellen enters, rattled.

          ELLEN
          I need to talk to you.

          STEPHANIE
          Ellen. I'm sorry. This a bad time
          right now. I got a little emergency
          and... say you got any cash I can
          borrow?
          She starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag.

          ELLEN
          No, I don't. But Steph I--

          STEPHANIE
          --what about your credit cards?
          What's your cash advance limit?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          64.
          STEPHANIE (cont'd)
          I'll pay you back. You know I'm
          good for it.

          ELLEN
          Steph, we need to talk about the
          cat.

          STEPHANIE
          Where has that little rascal been?
          He's always running off, have you
          noticed that?

          ELLEN
          Stephanie. I was in the back yard
          and I saw where the ground was dug
          up. I started digging and... You
          buried that little kitty in our
          backyard. What happened?

          STEPHANIE
          I didn't want to tell you. It fell
          out the window and died. It's sad,

          BUT--

          ELLEN
          I found the bloody knife in the
          bushes.

          STEPHANIE
          What are you, a cat detective?

          ELLEN
          Steph? I'm going to tell you this
          as your friend. There is something
          seriously wrong with you.
          Stephanie looks up from,her frantic panting.

          STEPHANIE
          Uh... Duhi

          ELLEN
          I'm moving out. I can't live like
          this.

          STEPHANIE.
          Fine.
          Ellen exits. Stephanie angrily calls after her:

          

          

          

          

          65.

          STEPHANIE
          An' don't let the barn door hit you
          on your ass on yer way out!

          INT. STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Stephanie is speaking into a pay phone.

          STEPHANIE
          I can't get the twenty thousand.
          You're gonna have to help me with
          what I've got.

          RHAM JAS' VOICE
          What do you have?
          She covers the mouthpiece, speaking to someone off camera.

          STEPHANIE
          How much?!
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that we are'in a PAWN SHOP. Men
          haggle loudly in Arabic over the price of a gold chain. The
          PAWN BROKER stands before-all of Stephanie's worldly
          belongings: A toaster oven, computer, racing bike, stereo,
          microwave oven, necklaces, jewelry... 

          PAWN BROKER
          Thirty-eight hundred for
          everything.

          STEPHANIE
          Including my jewlery?

          PAWN BROKER
          Including.
          Stephanie curses under her breath, checks the balance on her
          checkbook, does the math, speaks into the phone;

          STEPHANIE
          Six thousand.

          RHAM JAS
          I'm sorry. Not possible.

          STEPHANIE
          Look, I'll give you six now and--

          

          

          

          

          

          66.

          RHAM JAS
          No. There will be others involved
          and I cannot-ask them to accept
          such a risk for less. Good night.
          He hangs up. The line goes dead. She tries to throw the phone
          but it's attached with a short metal cord. She turns to the
          Pawn Broker.

          STEPHANIE
          I'll take it!
          Stephanie thinks about how she'll get the extra cash. She
          hesitantly dials a number on the pay phone. It rings and
          rings as she glances to a picture buried deep in her wallet:
          A. photo of...
          The younger, obese Stephanie and her stern looking Mother.
          Both stand before a bleak snow covered, mid-western farm.

          STEPHANIE
          Mom? Hi, it's me. Did you get,the
          Christmas card? Yeah, I guess it
          has been a while. Listen, I'm in
          kind of a fix, here. I've been
          pretty sick and I need to borrow
          some money for an operation. I need
          fourteen thousand dollars right
          away. Now I know you still have
          that pension fund at the credit
          Union so-- yeah, but... okay. Okay,
          it's just that--- I understand.
          Okay, mom. Bye.
          The line goes dead. She slumps down against the pay phone.

          CLOSE SHOT - STEPHANIE
          She pouts her lips in the mirror, carefully applying
          lipstick. Looking good.

          PULL BACK
          To reveal we are in the employee bathroom at the bank. She
          fixes her hair so it's just right. She. straightens out a tiny
          wrinkle in her business suit, smiles her best upbeat smile
          and exits the bathroom.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA- DAY

          Stephanie approaches Mr. Jacks.

          STEPHANIE
          Mr. Jacks, this is kind of awkward
          for me... I know it's not official
          yet, but I was wondering if I could
          get a copy of the employment
          contract for the new position you
          offered me?

          MR. JACKS
          The assistant manager's position?

          STEPHANIE
          Yes. See, one of my family members
          is having a little emergency which
          requires me to get them an
          immediate loan--

          MR. JACKS
          --Stephanie... There's a problem.
          The McPherson deal was cancelled
          last night. 

          STEPHANIE
          What? 1

          MR. JACKS
          Yeah, right after I informed the
          main branch that we had this big
          loan pending,,I find out that they
          just made their deal over at First
          National. I got a call in to see,
          what exactly happened but right now
          this doesn't look too good for you
          or me. So this assistant manager
          promotion has been delayed. In
          fact, I think that with everything
          that's been happening, I'm gonna
          have to give that job to Stu.
          Stephanie is devastated.

          STEPHANIE
          Stu. I see.
          Mr. Jacks sees tears begin to well up in her eyes.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          MR. JACKS
          I'm sorry. Look. If you've got
          family problems. Maybe you should
          take the day off and sort them out.
          Stephanie node and exits the bank.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - DAY


          CLOSE SHOT - THE WALL CLOCK
          As it TICKS away the seconds.
          CLOSE SHOT - THE Inadequate PILE OF CASH
          That site atop Stephanie's Kitchen table.

          CLOSE SHOT - A DESPONDENT STEPHANIE
          stares down at the cash. Her mouth mechanically opens to
          accept a large serving spoon of Rocky Road ice cream which
          she eats directly from the one gallon tub.
          The door bell rings. A moment later Ray walks in.. Stephanie
          stands, surprised.

          RAY.
          I paid Rham Jas

          STEPHAINE
          But I thought you didn't believe...

          RAY'
          I don't. But you do. I know this is
          important for, you .
          she embraces him.

          EXT. PASADENA HOUSE - DUSK

          An old Pasadena home site alone atop a hill. Ray's car drives
          up, parks.

          STEPHANIE
          Are you coming in?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          RAY

          T
          I wanted to but Rham Jas said non
          believers weren't welcome. I still
          don't like this.

          STEPHANIE
          I know how crazy this must seem.
          But it will all be over after this
          I swear to you.
          He nods. She kisses him.

          STEPHANIE
          I'll call you when it's done.

          RAY
          I'll be waiting.

          STEPHANIE
          We'll laugh about it on the train,
          tomorrow.

          RAY
          t Yeah. 
          Stephanie steps from the car. Ray drives off. She turns to
          face the old house.

          INT. OLD PASADENA HOUSE - STUDY - DUSK

          Milos, a thirty year old, Hungarian Man, leads Stephanie into
          a large room with-tall, teak bookshelves and Indian
          tapestries that adorn the walls. Rham Jas is seated in a
          wicker chair,' speaking with someone obscured by shadows...

          RHAM JAS
          Miss Brown. Allow me the pleasure
          of an introduction...
          A woman rises from the shadows.

          RHAM JAS
          .Shaun San Dena
          The eighty year old woman smiles a toothless smile to
          Stephanie.

          

          

          

          

          70.

          RHAM JAS
          Shaun San Dena is an experienced 41
          medium. Furthermore, she has a
          personal knowledge of the Lamia.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          I first encountered this spirit
          forty years ago in a small village
          outside of Bucharest.

          STEPHANIE
          And...?

          SHUAN SAN DENA
          I lost a young boy's soul to the
          beast.

          STEPHANIE
          That's reassuring.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          I was an. inexperienced seer then.
          I've learned much since that woeful
          day. I have waited these long years
          for a chance at redeeming myself. A
          chance to destroy the foul thing.
          Tonight my chance will come. But to
          summon it, I will need your help.

          STEPHANIE
          I'll do whatever it takes. And the
          sooner the better.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          Our business must wait till
          darkness falls. Enough time for
          tea.

          INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

          A ceiling twenty feet high, with massive windows covered by
          dark burgundy drapes. An ornate crystal chandelier hangs
          above a round table in the room's center. Stephanie, Rham
          Jas, Shaun San Dena and Milos, are finishing their tea.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          My late husband, Sandor, was also a
          medium. He chose this site to build
          the'house upon because he sensed
          certain energies that intersected
          here...

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          71.
          SHAUN SAN DENA (cont'd)
          He knew I would sense his spirit
          in this place as I have sensed
          others. It was to be our way of 
          being together after he died. In
          earlier times it was a sacred place
          to the Tuanteteck indians. And
          their stories told that the place
          was a burial ground of the "old
          ones" that inhabited the earth
          before them. Here, there is a
          particular alignment of energies. A
          confluence, that allows doorways to
          be opened. Through which, we might
          pass.

          RHAM JAS '
          And through which, others might
          pass into our world.
          Milos removes the tea.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          It is time for us to begin.
          Shaun San Dena turns out the electric lights, leaving only
          the tables' candlelight for illumination.
          We hear the BLEATING of a goat. Stephanie startles. Milos
          reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain. The
          goat catches sight of Stephanie. It BLEATS in fear and
          attempts to run. But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a
          post. He moves to the table and lifts a velvet cloth
          revealing a large cattle slaughtering blade.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          Lord Jesus bless this knife and
          allow it to do your holy work.
          She makes the sign of the cross. she pours a .vial of holy
          water over the blade. She turns to Stephanie.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          Once the spirit has entered me,
          place my hand upon the animal. Do
          you understand?

          STEPHANIE
          Yes.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          I will force the spirit of the
          Lamia into the goat. Milos, that's
          when you strike.
          Stephanie blanches but remains silent.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          We must all.be receptive.
          Shaun San Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant.
          Stephanie leans close to speak quietly with Rham Jae.

          STEPHANIE
          What do I have to do?

          RHAM JAS
          You must allow the darkness in. You
          must invite the dead to co-mingle
          with your spirit..

          STEPHANIE
          I'm scared.

          RHAM JAS
          Yes. Now repeat these words... I
          welcome the dead into my soul...
          Rham Jae waits for Stephanie's response. She's shifts in her
          seat uncomfortably.

          STEPHANIE
          I welcome the dead into my soul...

          RHAM JAS
          You must believe it!
          Stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant again.
          This time,, together.

          RAM JAAS STEPHANIE
          I welcome the dead into my I welcome the dead into my
          soul... soul...
          Stephanie looks around the darkened room. Shadows from the
          candles dance upon the walls.

          

          

          

          

          73.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          I sense something here with us.

          RHAM JAS
          Yes.
          The parlor's crystal chandeleir tinkles.
          A tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment. Stephanie's eyes
          search the room.

          SOMETHING UNSEEN
          emits a wheezing breath...
          We hear FOOTSTEPS as something walks on the ceiling above
          them.

          A MAN'S LOUD LAUGHTER
          echoes about the room.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          It is not the Lamia. It is the
          spirit of some unsettled soul from

          1 
          years ago... The unsettled ones
          wait near the door.

          THE PITCHER OF WATER
          upon the table is drained. Then the water is spat out in a
          stream at Milos' face.
          The MAN'S LAUGHTER again.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          Be gone, foolish spirit!
          There is a HOWLING OF WIND and the room is again quiet.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          Show yourself Lamia. We invite you
          into our circle.
          Quiet. Stephanie looks about. Nothing seems to be happening.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          He's coming...

          

          

          

          

          74.
          A faint sound.

          SCRATCH. SCRATCH.
          The SCRATCHING OF FINGERNAILS on wood. A sound that
          Stephanie's heard before. It grows louder, more distorted.

          SCRATCH SCRATCH!
          Stephanie grips the table.
          And just when the SCRATCHING SOUND is deafening... All
          becomes silent.
          Stephanie holds her breath.
          A wind whips up in the room sending papers whirling about,.
          yet all the windows are closed.
          Shaun San Dena's eyes roll up into her head. She emits a low
          and powerful MOAN. Her head slumps onto her shoulders. Then
          she straightens with a new vigor. Stephanie and Rham Jas
          watch as her lips move rapidly and a garbled sound comes out
          of her throat. she speaks in a strange and incomprehensible
          tongue.

          RHAM JAS
          Who now inhabits the body of Shaun
          San Dena?

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          (demonic voice)
          Lamia...
          Rham Jas nods discreetly to Milos who quietly uncovers the
          slaughtering blade.

          RHAM JAS.
          Lamia, what is it that you desire?
          Shaun San Dena's chair abruptly spins about to face
          Stephanie. The mouth jerks opened and closed as if controlled
          by a bad puppeteer. Then, out of.sync, the demonic voice is

          HEARD:

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          (demonic voice)
          The soul of Stephanie Brownl We
          will feast upon it, as she festers
          in the gravel

          75.

          STEPHANIE
          It was my manager, Jim Jacks. 
          He was the one ! He--

          RHAM JAS
          Silence! Lamia, please, surely we
          can dissuade you from taking this
          insignificant woman? Surely she's
          not worthy of your greatness.
          The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          (demonic voice)
          No! I will enjoy watching her skin
          blister and pop in hell's flame. I
          come for her!
          Stephanie quickly grabs Shaun San Derna's hand and places it
          on the goat's head.
          Shaun San Dena's eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to
          regain control.
          Now there are two spirits battling within her. She attempts
          t to force the spirit of the Lamia from her body and into the
          goat. The Goat BLEATS and bucks wildly as the spirit is
          transferred. Milos raises up the slaughtering blade.

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          (demonic voice)
          No! You--

          GOAT
          (demonic voice)
          --tricked me!
          The possessed goat emits a terrible cry! The bone chilling
          SHRIEK of Lamia! It's oval eye reflects the blade as it
          descends toward it. The possessed Goat jerks aside and the
          blade misses, slicing into the chair.
          As Milos raises the blade for another blow, the goat bites
          his hand. In that moment, the spirit of the Lamia is
          transferred to him.
          A Possessed Milos SCREAMS and spins toward Stephanie, glaring
          at her with black goat eyes. He SHOUTS at her in a gibberish
          of tongues! His body jerks up into the air. He dances a jig
          atop the table, now laughing uncontrollably.
          t 

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Stephanie watches in horror.

          RHAM JAS
          Lamial I command you to leave this--
          A chair sails through the air and shatters across Rham Jas'
          back, knocking him to the ground.
          Milos' body is hurled up against the chandelier, shattering
          it. Glass rains down upon Stephanie.
          on the ceiling, Milos is spun.about like a pin wheel.
          Stephanie races for the door but a
          .huge bureau lurches in
          front of her, blocking her path.
          Rham Jas rouses a stunned Shaun San Dena.

          RHAM JAS
          You must banish the spirit!
          Shaun San Dena places her hands on her ayes, then over her
          heart and chants an ancient Gypsy incantation up toward
          Milos.
          Milos SHRIEKS. A white vapor streams from his body as the
          Lamia is torn from him.

          MILOS
          (in his normal voice)
          Stop the chanting. I beg you!
          But Shaun San Dena only chants louder. Milos SCREAMS grow
          more intense as-his body spasms in pain. Stephanie grasps at
          Shaun San Dena.

          STEPHANIE
          For god's sake, stop the chanting,
          it's killing him!
          Rham Jas pushes her aside.

          RHAM JAS
          You must not stop!
          A withered pair of hands reach down from above and clutch at
          Stephanie's face! It is Mrs. Ganush that now floats above
          her! Her long yellowed fingernails scratching at Stephanie's
          skin.

          77.

          MILOS/MRS. GANUSH 
          Make her stop, you dirty pork
          queen!

          STEPHANIE
          No! Get her off!
          Mrs. Ganush grabs at Stephanie's head. Stephanie pulls away
          but it costs her a clump of hair that Mrs. Ganush rips from
          her head.
          Mrs. Ganush opens her mouth... wide... wider still... she
          vomits out Stephanie's dead cat. It lands atop the table.
          Stephanie screams uncontrollably.
          Shaun San Dena, is trembling as her chanting comes to a
          climax.
          Mrs. Ganush changes back to the possessed Milo. The last of
          the white vapor is torn from Milos body as the spirit of the
          Lamia leaves him. Milos falls to the floor and all is quiet.
          An ashen faced Shaun San Dena halts her chant.

          10 STEPHANIE 
          Is it gone?
          Stephanie notices that the cat has vanished. Was it ever
          there?
          Rham Jae kneels at Milos' side. He's starting to come around.
          Milos stands, shaken. The Lamia is gone.
          Shaun San Dena grabs at her chest, struggles for breath.
          Stephanie rushes over to steady her.

          STEPHANIE
          Let me help you...

          SHAUN SAN DENA
          My heart.
          Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms. Rham Jas
          moves to assist her. They lower Shaun San Dana to the floor.

          RHAM JAS
          Milos, call an ambulance!

          78.
          Milos rushes from the room to call for help... Rham Jas
          checks for a pulse.

          RHAM JAS
          She's not breathing.
          Rham Jas attempts to administer CPR to no avail.

          STEPHANIE
          My God. My God...
          He checks her pulse one last time. The CPR is finally halted.
          Rham Jas closes her eyes, then touches her forehead, praying:

          RHAM JAS
          Gata, gata, para gata... bodhi
          suaha. Gone, gone, gone beyond.
          Gone beyond the beyond. Hail the
          goer.

          EXT. PASADENA HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

          Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as PARAMEDICS load the covered
          body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance. They close the
          doors and drive away.

          STEPHANIE
          It's sad:

          RHAM JAS
          Yes.

          STEPHANIE
          Strange how things work out. She
          waited years for another chance to
          overcome the lamia ..and finally
          she did.

          RHAM JAS
          No. I'm afraid you misunderstand.
          Rham Jas looks at her with pity.

          STEPHANIE
          What?

          RHAM JAS
          The,Lamia can not'be banished by a
          medium. This was our lesson
          tonight. I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          STEPHANIE

          0 
          But I saw her get rid of the
          thing...

          RHAM JAS
          No. You saw her drive the Lamia
          from the seance. That is all. It
          will be back.

          STEPHANIE
          But then, what am I supposed to do?
          Rham Jas shrugs. He fishes in his pocket for his car keys.

          RHAM JAS
          Perhaps on this final evening, you
          should finish up the business of
          this world. For before the night is
          through, the Lamia will come for
          the owner of the accursed object.

          STEPHANIE'S HAND
          Slowly emerges from her coat pocket. She studies the thin
          brass button in her palm. 0

          RHAM JAS
          Unless, of course... you were no
          longer the owner.

          STEPHANIE
          No longer the owner? I don't
          understand.
          Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank
          envelope. He places the button within and seals it.

          RHAM JAS
          The Lamia comes for the owner of
          the accursed object. Just make a
          gift of it...
          To demonstrate, he hands the envelope to Stephanie.

          RHAM JAS
          .and you've given away the curse.

          

          

          

          

          80.

          STEPHANIE
          Why didn't you tell me this
          before?!

          RHAM JAS
          Because we are speaking of murder.
          Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to
          Rham Jas. She places the envelope carefully into the side
          'pocket of her purse. Rham Jas tries to conceal the sadness
          and fear he feels for her.

          RHAM JAS
          Whatever you decide, you have until
          sunrise.'
          She nods goodbye as Ray's car pulls up. Ray opens the door.
          for her and she gets in.

          INT. RAY'S BMW - NIGHT

          Ray and Stephanie drive through the quiet Pasadena
          neighborhood.

          RAY
          Is it over?
          Stephanie, stares at her envelope, thinks about telling him,
          then...

          STEPHANIE
          Yes. It's all over.
          Ray squeezes her hand. Appreciating the two of them now more
          than ever.
          Stephanie SCREAMS as...
          MRS. GANUSH.appears in the headlights, standing on the road
          before them! Ray hits the breaks. The car SCREECHES to a
          halt!
          Stephanie's purse with the envelope and.some of Ray's papers
          fall to the floor.

          RAY
          Are you okay?
          Stephanie nods, catching her breath.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          RAY

          R
          That guy came out of nowhere.
          Stephanie looks to the figure in the road. Mrs. Ganush is
          gone. In her place is an old man who mutters angrily at them
          and moves on.

          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT -- LATER

          RAY'S BMW pulls up and Stephanie gets out.

          RAY
          Are you'still okay about the Santa
          Barbara trip?

          STEPHANIE
          Yes, everything's fine.

          RAY
          Okay. Our train leaves tomorrow
          morning. Seven A.M. When do you
          want me to pick you up?

          STEPHANIE
          It's better if we meet at the
          D station. There's something I've got
          to do on the way.
          Stephanie suddenly' clutches at her purse. The envelope is
          gone!

          STEPHANIE
          Wait! Where's my envelope?

          RAY
          What envelope?
          She opens the car door and frantically rummages around the
          floor, through Ray's papers.

          STEPHANIE
          It's got to be here!
          Then, Stephanie comes upon something under the seat. She
          smiles and stands. A white envelope held tightly in her
          hand.

          STEPHANIE
          Got , it .

          Tomorrow's gonna be a new start for,
          us. Don't be late.
          They kiss and Ray drives off.

          INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT


          A WALL CLOCK
          The time is 1:30 A.M.

          STEPHANIE
          drinks coffee and stares at the white envelope that's tucked
          into the side pocket of her purse. She scans the patrons and
          considers giving it to each of them, then one by one, rejects
          the idea.

          A WAITRESS
          Comes by, removes a dirty dish and refills her coffee.

          STEPHANIE
          Banana Boat Sundae.

          WAITRESS
          Another one?
          Stephanie nods absently. The waitress exits.

          THE WALL CLOCK
          The time is now 2:15 A.M.

          A WITHERED OLD MAN
          site alone at a table in a wheelchair. A portable oxygen
          cylinder, supplying him with air.

          STEPHANIE
          takes a deep breath, stands and walks to his table.

          STEPHANIE
          I wonder if you could help me out?
          The Old Man looks up, sees her desperation.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          OLD MAN 0
          Yeah?

          STEPHANIE
          I just need you to hang on to this
          envelope for me. Just until
          tomorrow.
          She extends the envelope to him. He hesitates.

          OLD MAN
          What's this all about?

          STEPHANIE
          Just take the envelope and I'll
          explain. Please.
          The Old Man considers. He reaches for the envelope when an
          OLD WOMAN, his wife, hobbles toward the table. The Old Man
          helps her sit and puts away her cane. They turn to Stephanie
          who withdraws the envelope.

          STEPHANIE
          Never mind.
          Stephanie returns to her seat, ashamed at what she almost 
          did.
          She returns the envelope to the purse pocket, racking her
          brains, trying to think of some way out of this. Her gaze
          lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table. She
          grabs the paper and finds the OBITUARIES.

          CLOSE ON THE NEWSPAPER:
          MRS. GANUSH'S OBITUARY: A photo of the old woman. The
          location of the burial is listed: Oakwood Cemetary.
          Stephanie rips the listing from the paper and rushes from the
          restaurant.

          INT. RHAM JAS' HOUSE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Stephanie, lit by a barren light bulb, paces the room. Rham
          Jas in his pajamas, studies an old leather bound text.

          STEPHANIE
          Well? Is it possible? 0

          He closes the book and gives it some thought.

          RHAM JAS
          There are Gypsy blessings that are
          bestowed upon the dead... And the
          Gypsies give gifts to their
          departed to curry favor with the
          deceased soul. Yes. I do believe
          you could give the curse to someone
          who has passed on... for truly, the
          soul never dies.

          INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON STEPHANIE
          As she drives we hear the voice over from the preceding

          SCENE:

          RHAM JAS (V.0.)
          .but you must make a formal gift
          of the cursed object to the
          deceased.

           STEPHANIE (V.0.)
          Formal gift... ?
          Car headlights sweep over her grim face. She fingers the
          envelope, then glances to the seat next to her... a SHOVEL.

          RHAM JAS (V.0.)
          Give it to the corpse personally.
          Put it in their hand... their'
          pocket...

          STEPHANIE (V.0.)
          Oh, I'll do better than that...
          CAMERA moves in tight.

          STEPHANIE
          .I'll shove it down her goddamn
          throat.
          She zips up her raincoat. SOMETHING flits past the window.
          Too.quick to.see. Then it reappears. It's Mrs. Ganush's
          hankie. It.flies against Stephanie's windshield and gets
          caught on the wiper blade. Stephanie GASPS. It flaps in the
          wind, blocking her view. Stephanie hits the wiper button.
          The hankie is yanked-back and forth across the windshield.

          85.
          She turns up the wiper speed. No sooner is it knocked loose
          than it's whisked into the driver's side window. It slaps
          over Stephanie's eyes, plastered there by the'wind! The car 
          swerves.
          Her car crashes into a tree.

          LONG SHOT - CRASHED CAR
          Stephanie pulls herself from the crash. She glances up to a
          flash of lightning. It illuminates:
          The wrought iron gates of the OAKWOOD CEMETERY. A hill of
          tombstones beyond.

          EXT. OAKWOOD CEMETERY - RAINY NIGHT

          A light drizzle falls as Stephanie'searches the graveyard for
          the burial place of Mrs. Ganush. She carries the shovel
          defensively, ready to swat at anything that might leap out at
          her.
          She stops before a freshly dug grave. A temporary marker
          reads the name. "Sylvia Ganush".
          She's scared now, not sure if she can really go through with
          it. A church bell TOLLS five times. There's no time to think 
          about it. Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is
          watching, then starts to dig.

          DISSOLVE TO:
          LATER - It's raining harder. The hole Stephanie digs is now
          several feet deep.
          CLUNK: The shovel has hit the buried coffin. The rain
          intensifies.

          DISSOLVE TO:
          LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave. In the
          bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine
          casket. She jams the shovel blade between two boards and
          pries off the coffin's top and shoves it aside.
          A lightning flash illuminates the corpse. Mrs. Ganush's white
          eye is open and staring at Stephanie.
          Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from
          her coat.

          STEPHANIE
          I'm giving it back to you.
          She grabs Mrs. Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched
          fist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut. Stephanie
          pulls with all her might, causing...

          MRS. GANUSH'S CORPSE
          to lurch up and out of the coffin. Her dead arms, thrown
          forward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie. Stephanie
          SCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes the corpse
          away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud.

          STEPHANIE
          You'll take it, all right...
          She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old
          woman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth. She pries the
          jaw open. Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into
          the grave from all sides. The body of Mrs. Ganush is quickly
          being re-buried.

          STEPHANIE
          I, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make
          a formal gift of this button to
          you, Sylvia Ganush.
          She jams the white envelope down the old woman's throat.

          STEPHANIE
          Choke on it, bitch.
          She kicks the old woman's jaw.. It SNAPS shut, trapping the
          envelope between her broken teeth.
          Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs..
          Ganush's face. It covers everything, except the jutting
          envelope and a single, staring white eye.
          Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick.
          She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it
          tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up
          to her armpits.

          THE HEAD OF MRS. GANUSH
          Bobs up, through the mud. The Old Woman is grinning, with the
          envelope still jammed between her teeth.

          

          

          

          

          87.

          LONG SHOT - THE GRAVE 
          Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction. It
          has become the drain hole of the cemetery.

          THE INFLUX OF MUD
          pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning
          face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM
          is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the
          mud.
          The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO
          PULL AWAY when...

          STEPHANIE'S HAND
          rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root.

          STEPHANIE'S HEAD
          Breaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air. She claws her
          way out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain.

           DISSOLVE TO: 

          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN

          STEPHANIE steps from the shower, quickly towels her hair. She
          stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror. She
          has survived. The phone RINGS in the bedroom; the machine
          picks up.

          MR. JACKS' VOICE
          Stephanie. It's Jim. Jim Jacks.
          Sorry I'm calling so early-- but
          Last night I found some troubling
          information about our friend Stu
          Rubin...

          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN

          A cleaned up Stephanie, her hair still wet from the shower,
          drives the empty morning streets. A smile slowly comes to her
          face as we hear the rest of Mr. Jack's message:

          

          

          

          

          88.

          MR. JACKS' VOICE
          Apparently he stole your file on 4
          the Mcpherson loan and then tried
          to broker his own deal at First
          Federal. I guess he thought we
          wouldn't find out. When I
          confronted him he broke down crying
          and well, we won't be seeing him
          around anymore.

          EXT. TRAIN STATION - PARKING LOT - PRE DAWN

          The Eastern sky is growing brighter. Stephanie's car pulls
          into the lot. She removes a week end bag from her trunk and
          walks briskly toward the station.

          MR JACKS

          (V.O.)
          It looks like the loan's coming
          back to us. And I just wanted you
          to know that come Monday morning,
          that assistant manager's position
          will be waiting for you.

          INT. TRAIN STATION - GRAND ENTRANCE - PRE DAWN

          Stephanie is smiling as she enters the station.

          A MRS. FIELDS REPRESENTATIVE
          holds a platter of freshly baked cookies and offers free
          samples to passersby. One is offered to Stephanie.
          She politely declines as she walks past with a bounce in her
          step.

          INT. TRAIN STATION - CLOTHING BOUTIQUE

          She stops at the window, admiring a coat on display.
          She glances down at her own coat. Notes the missing button.
          with distaste.
          Inside, a SALESWOMAN is preparing to open the shop.
          Stephanie taps on the window, shouts through the glass:

          STEPHANIE
          Hey! Good morning.

          NO 4

          

          

          

          

          89.
          The Saleswoman opens the door a crack.
          t 

          SALESWOMAN
          I'm sorry, we're not open yet.

          STEPHANIE
          Please. I know what I want. That
          coat in the window.
          The Saleswoman considers.

          STEPHANIE
          My boyfriend and I are taking a
          very special trip this morning.
          Stephanie's smile is bright. Her joy is contagious. The
          Saleswoman relents and lets Stephanie in.

          EXT. TRAIN STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAWN

          Moments before sunrise, the sky is streaked red.
          Ray waits on the train platform, clutching two tickets and a
          small garment bag. Behind him, other Passengers arrive. From
          his pocket, he removes a velvet case. He opens it and peeks
          t inside A diamond ring. He stows it back in his pocket.
          He looks for Stephanie.
          Then, his face brightens as Stephanie emerges from the crowd,
          radiant in her, new coat.

          STEPHANIE
          Ray!
          Ray embraces her and grabs her luggage. A TRAIN WHISTLE
          sounds as the train approaches.

          RAY
          Is everything okay?

          STEPHANIE
          Great.

          RAY
          I'm so glad you're here. There's so
          much I've been meaning to tell you.
          0 She takes his hand. 0

          

          

          

          

          90.

          STEPHANIE
          But let me say this first while I
          have it straight in my head. You
          never stopped believing in me. I'll
          try and live up to that.
          They share an intimate moment. A romantic kiss. He breaks off
          and smiles.

          RAY
          Did I tell you, you look great?

          STEPHANIE
          Thanks.
          Stephanie models her new coat.

          STEPHANIE
          You like it? It's brand new.

          RAY
          What'd you do with your old coat?
          Just the mention of it, makes her face darken.

          STEPHANIE
          I got rid of it. I never want to
          see it again.

          RAY
          Too bad,'cause I just found this.
          Ray produces the envelope. And from it, withdraws... THE

          CURSED BUTTON!
          CAMERA RACES INTO A HUGE CLOSE UP OF THE BUTTON with a
          terrible CLASHING of symbols!.
          Stephanie can't breathe.

          RAY
          Yeah, it was in my car. Hey, have
          you seen my Indian Head nickel? I
          put it in an envelope just like
          this one.
          Stephanie stares at the button, shaking her head in
          disbelief. The RUMBLING of the approaching train builds on
          the sound track.

          4

          

          

          

          

          91.

          RAY
          What? What is it?
          She backs away in horror, but Ray follows her with the button
          still in his hand.
          The RUMBLING grows louder. She's backing up toward the edge
          of the platform.

          RAY
          Stephanie. Stop!
          Ray steps forward, still holding out the button. Stephanie
          SHRIEKS as she falls backwards, off the platform and onto the
          tracks.
          In her last moment of life, she turns her head to see...

          THE ONCOMING TRAIN
          Racing at her!
          Through the swirling smoke, the engine's mechanical face,
          resembles the goat like face of the demon Lamia.
          It VOMITS STEAM as it angrily bares down upon her.

          THE TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS!
          Stephanie recognizes the sound. It's a cry she's heard
          before. In every door creak... in every cold night wind... a
          haunting, soulless sound... the cry of Lamia.
          Ray races to the edge of the platform. The two lover's eyes
          find each other one last time.
          Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her
          down into hell.

          THE PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM
          Believe they have witnessed a train accident but Ray knows
          the truth. He looks to...

          THE BUTTON
          still in his hand.

          CAMERA MOVES CLOSER ON RAY
          

          92.
          A look of dread. Finally, he believes.

ARAC ATTACK
   (Eight Legged Freaks)

        July 2000 Draft




    FOR EDUCATIONAL
     PURPOSES ONLY

                      ARAC ATTACK!


FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

A rabbit hops across rough terrain.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP
454.


INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.

                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.

                         PIG PEN
           I will be self-assured and
           confident around women.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses
the highway in front of the third.


INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT

                         SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
           I will not fear the unexpected.

                         PIG PEN
           I will not fear the unexpected.

The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.

                           PIG PEN
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!

Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
bunny.


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The truck slews crazily.    Missing the bunny by a whisker.

                                                        2.

INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT

Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
rig together.


EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT

The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
water below.


EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT

A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
ink.


EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly.

JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people.

                         JOSHUA
          Hey, Mike.   Check this one out.

MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look.     Puberty hit hard
and fast for this bright, little nerd.

                         MIKE
          He's huge!

                        JOSHUA
          They've been like this all week.
          Must be something extra tasty in
          the water.

                         MIKE
          Like what?

                        JOSHUA
          Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
          in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
          dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
          satisfying.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                         3.

CONTINUED:

                              MIKE
             You ate snake?

                           JOSHUA
             When you're thirty klicks out from
             the nearest firebase. Humpin'
             through the wake-up with your
             finger on the trigger. Charlie
             doesn't give you time to stop for
             cutlet.

As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.


EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere.


INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.

                           CHARLIE (V.O.)
             Charlie, don't surf!

                              JOSHUA
             Quiet, bird.     We're working.

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.

                           JOSHUA
                    (dims tank lights)
             The sun is going down, my
             nocturnal hunters. It's time to
             come out and feed.

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.

                          MIKE
             Yeah. They're definitely getting
             bigger.

                           JOSHUA
             I've calculated a growth factor of
             twelve percent over the last
             forty-eight hours. But that seems
             to be accelerating.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           4.

CONTINUED:

                           MIKE
             All from eating these bugs?   Maybe
             I should try some.

Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects.

                           MIKE
             Run, little guys.

                           JOSHUA
             They can't outrun the food chain.

                           MIKE
             I could get away.

                           JOSHUA
             Imagine yourself the size of that
             fly. A scytodes spitter would be
             as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
             spider chow, kid.

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel.

                           MIKE
             Are the new tarantulas in here?

                           JOSHUA
             Took me forever to get a breeding
             set of Chilean reds. I must have
             bribed every customs agent from
             Vegas to Santiago.

Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male
tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a
mummy-like bundle.

                           MIKE
             That is too cool.

                           JOSHUA
             Male tarantulas compete for the
             female's attention.
                           (MORE)

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           5.

CONTINUED:

                           JOSHUA (CONT'D)
             Each one tries to bring her the
             best present. Bugs, rats, even
             the occasional parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS.

                           JOSHUA
             The prey is cocooned alive so she
             can eat them in her nest. You
             know how women love breakfast in
             bed.

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.

                           JOSHUA
             Take a look, the female of the
             species is three times as big as
             the male.

Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
tarantula.

                           JOSHUA
             Say hello to Consuela.

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

                           JOSHUA
             She fills her prey with digestive
             acid to liquify the internal
             organs. Now watch... She'll drink
             her victim from the inside out.
             While it's still alive!

                           MIKE
                    (looks queasy)
             And you wonder why my mom doesn't
             like me hanging out with you.

                           JOSHUA
             Arachnids have been roaming the
             earth for millions of years. And
             they'll be here long after the
             human race is dead and buried.

Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass.     Mike recoils.

                            MIKE
             Bad!   Bad Consuela!

Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.

                                                        6.

TARANTULA POV - MIKE

The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.


BACK TO MIKE

Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.

                        MIKE
          Do that again and I feed you to
          the parrot.

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily.    The sound of a CAR HORN.

                        JOSHUA
          There's your mom.

                        MIKE
          See you tomorrow, Joshua!

Mike heads for the door.


EXT. DESERT - DAY

The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,
PROSPERITY, NV.


INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
the tunnel.

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
fades...

                           CHRIS
          Damn.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          7.

CONTINUED:

Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
sack lunch.

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch.

                           CHRIS
             Hope you like bologna!



EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
trunk.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside
her.

                             MIKE
             You   should see them, Mom. Each
             one   has a unique feeding behavior.
             The   spitters fire poisonous snot.
             The   tarantulas mummify their prey.
             The   jumpers can...

                           SAM
             Why does he have all those things?

                           MIKE
             He studies them. NASA uses spider
             webs in outer space. And for
             medicine. They've been here
             forever, and they'll be here long
             after we're all dead.

                           SAM
             You're givin' me nightmares.

                           MIKE
             Nightmares are cool.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         8.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             U.P.S. brought this to the
             station.

Sam hands Mike a small package.

                           MIKE
             It's from Dad! He didn't forget
             my birthday. I told you he
             wouldn't.

                           SAM
             Better late than never.

Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.

                             MIKE
             Rockin'!

                           SAM
             Is that the one you wanted?

                           MIKE
             Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
             ram. Integrated modem. Voice
             recording capability. This baby
             is tight.

Mike can't turn on the gizmo.

                             SAM
             What's wrong?

                           MIKE
             He forgot to send the batteries.

                           SAM
                    (annoyed)
             I told him to send batteries.


EXT. DESERT - DAY

The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
desert.

BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
bike.

                           BRET
             Hang on, babydoll!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             9.

CONTINUED:

They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow
lines. Wheelie for days. Ashley peeks over Bret's
shoulder at a police car coming at them in the opposite
lane.

                           ASHLEY
             Oh shit.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.

                           SAM
             Hang on.

                           MIKE
             Why?


EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights
ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the
shoulder.


EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY

The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind.        Sam's
voice barks over the PA.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             Party's over, gentlemen.   Off the
             bikes.

Sam exits the car and approaches.       The bikers dismount.

                           BRET
             There is something very sexy about
             an older woman in uniform.

                           LARRY
             Her nine-millimeter gives me a
             stiffy.

                           ASHLEY
             Don't antagonize her, you guys.

                           SAM
             I told you not to act like
             kamikazes. Especially with Ashley
             riding behind. That is
             unacceptable, Bret.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            10.

CONTINUED:

                           BRET
             I could always ride her from
             behind.

Larry snickers.     Sam steels her rage.

                           SAM
             You just bought yourself a
             reckless.

Sam begins to write up the ticket.

                           ASHLEY
             Can't you give 'em a break?

                           SAM
             Get in the car, Ashley.       Now.

                              ASHLEY
             But, Mom!

Sam shoots his daughter an intimidating glance.

                           BRET
             No sweat, babydoll.       We'll hook up
             later.

                           SAM
                    (threatening)
             Over my dead body.


INT. SAM'S COP CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Mike grins from the front seat as Ashley climbs in back.

                           MIKE
             You have the right to remain
             silent. Anything you say can and
             will be used...

                              ASHLEY
             Shut up, dork.


EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY - DAY

Sam hands Bret the ticket.

                           BRET
             Larry, do we know anybody at City
             Hall who can mark this go away?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.

                           LARRY
             Your Dad is the Mayor.

                           BRET
             Oh, yeah.
                    (to Sam)
             He signs your paycheck.

                           SAM
             The next time you put my
             daughter's life in danger, I'll
             show you exactly how little that
             means to me.

Bret and Larry feel her resolve.

                           BRET
             Relax, bee-otch. It's all good.

The punks remount their bikes.

                           SAM
             I want both wheels on the ground.

The punks REV their BIKES and defiantly wheelie toward
town.


INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

Sam climbs behind the wheel.

                           MIKE
             I read her her rights.

                           SAM
             I can always count on you, Mike.

Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town.

                           ASHLEY
             Do you get off on humiliating me?

                           SAM
             This bad girl act doesn't suit
             you, Ash.

                           ASHLEY
             I'm just trying to have fun.
             Don't you remember what it's like
             to grow up here?

                           SAM
             That's what scares me.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          12.

CONTINUED:

Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out
a stun gun. Mike passes it through the bars to Ashley.

                           SAM
             I told you to keep this with you.

Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.

                           ASHLEY
             You are so over protective.

Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.

                           SAM
             A mother's job is to protect her
             children.

                           ASHLEY
             You need to start trusting me.

                           SAM
             I'd like to. But you keep
             skipping classes to go to the
             dunes with Bret.

                           ASHLEY
             Why do you hate him so much?

                           SAM
             I don't hate him. I just want you
             to have a future. I thought you
             wanted to get out of town. Go to
             med school.

                           ASHLEY
             Maybe I want to stay. I could get
             pregnant by nineteen. Then
             divorce with a couple of kids I
             can't handle. Slap on a badge and
             be a trailer trash sheriff.

                           SAM
                    (deeply hurt)
             Thanks for the flashback.

They drive on in painful silence.     Mike turns ON the
RADIO.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             ... listening to W.F.R.E. Freedom
             radio. We've put aside the

INT. PICKUP TRUCK (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Chris drives into town with the RADIO ON.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          ... for some down home talk back
          with our own mayor: Wade Hale.

                        CHRIS
          Oh, great.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Thanks, Harlan. As I was saying,
          Chemical Technologies has been
          looking for viable storage sites.
          And Prosperity is lucky enough to
          be on that list.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Lucky? I think most of us are
          insulted that some outsiders think
          our town is a perfect place to
          dump toxic waste.

                        CHRIS
          Right on.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place
where everybody has known each other since childhood.
Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Isn't this just your latest get-
          rich quick scheme?

At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many
outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:
"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINAL
CLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio
antenna.

                        HARLAN (V.O.)
          Your mall has more employees than
          customers.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK (TOWN, MAIN STREET) - DAY

                           WADE (V.O.)
             I may have overestimated the need
             for 100,000 square feet of outlet
             shopping.


EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

BEVERLY (40's) is tending to her garden as she listens to
a transistor radio.

                           HARLAN (V.O.)
             And your ostrich ranch?

                           WADE (V.O.)
             If the government subsidies hadn't
             dried up, I'd still be rolling in
             cash.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An airstream at the far end of town. Signs identify it
as: "FREEDOM RADIO." A brand new humvee is parked out
front.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Walls decorated with clippings about aliens, monsters,
and conspiracies. Two men sit at a home built
transmitter.

HARLAN GRIFFITH (40s) wears an "Aliens Go Home!" T-
shirt. He eats from a box of Frosted Flakes and drinks
Jolt cola.

WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-
haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer
than a Mayor.

                            WADE
             With one phone call I could put
             together a deal that would make us
             all very rich.

                           HARLAN
             They say money doesn't buy
             happiness.

                           WADE
             They probably don't have any.

INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

Sam and her kids listen to the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Money pays for kids to go to
          college. It pays the mortgage.


INT. DINER (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

An attractive waitress on roller-skates. A harried CHEF.
Locals chow down. The RADIO BLARES in the b.g.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          It puts food on the table.
          Haven't the people of this town
          lived hand-to-mouth for long
          enough?


INT. BARBERSHOP (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

FLOYD and LEROY are the Jurassic era barbers. Floyd cuts
Leroy's hair. The two men listen to the RADIO.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          We're all gonna die in this hell
          hole.

                        FLOYD
          Yeah, of boredom.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

DEPUTY PETE sits with his feet up on the desk reading

          Wouldn't it be nice not to worry
          about surviving retirement? Or
          taking a shot at that life-long
          dream?


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

                        WADE
          Think about it, Harlan, you could
          buy a commercial transmitter and
          start broadcasting to a national
          audience.

                        HARLAN
          It would be nice to get the
          message out. Let people know the
          aliens walk among us.

                                                     16.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

Chris slows to a stop in front of the McCormick and Son
Mining Company. This stately edifice was once the
driving force behind the local economy.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          If Chris McCormick refuses to sell
          his mines. The rest of us are out
          of luck.

Chris frowns.


INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY

                        WADE (V.O.)
          I don't think it's fair for one
          person to wield that much power.
          But he's just like his father.
          Selfish. Greedy. And more than a
          little bit nuts.

                          SAM
          Uh-oh.

Sam flips on the SIREN and accelerates.


INT. DINER - DAY

The locals stop eating and look toward the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          That family has been digging in
          those tunnels since the twenties.
          If there was something down there,
          don't you think they would have
          found it by now?


INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

Floyd and Leroy stare at the radio.

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Common sense does not apply to
          crazy people.


INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

                        WADE (V.O.)
          Might as well be chasing a
          leprechaun's pot of gold at the
          end of the rainbow.

INT. POLICE CAR - (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

As Sam pulls into town. She sees Chris skid to a stop in
front of Harlan's trailer. He leaps out of his pickup.

                           WADE (V.O.)
             ... at the very least...


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Chris yanks the door open in time to hear...

                           WADE
             ... those McCormicks are just
             plain-old dumb.

Wade stands up to protest. But it's too late. Chris
punches him in the nose. The mayor tumbles back.

                           CHRIS
             I've warned you not to talk about
             my family!

                           HARLAN
             We have a surprise guest in the
             studio.

Chris drags Wade to his feet, shoving him against the
wall.

                           CHRIS
             My family built this town!

CONTINUED:

                           WADE
             Am I supposed to be grateful?

Chris draws back his fist for another shot.       Sam runs in
and grabs him from behind.

                              SAM
             That's enough!

                           CHRIS
             Stay out of this, Sam!

She manhandles Chris toward the door.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY

Practically the entire town has gathered outside. Sam
drags Chris through the door. Wade and Harlan are close
behind.

                           CHRIS
             Did you hear what he said?

                              SAM
             I heard.

                           WADE
             I want him locked up!

                           SAM
             Let's all calm down.

Wade tries to take advantage of the assembled audience.

                           WADE
             We have no economy! People are
             barely scraping by! And now we've
             been offered the deal of a
             lifetime. You don't have the
             right to stand in our way!

                           CHRIS
             Those mines are full of gas. One
             spark in the wrong place could
             blow this entire valley sky high.
             Do you really want to load that
             gun with toxic waste?

                           WADE
             Chem-Tech did seismic analysis,
             vapor checks, groundwater reads,
             soil sampling. They found
             isolated methane pockets, but no
             benzene or hydrogen sulfide.

             How could they run tests? I
             didn't give them permission to go
             into the mines.

Wade retreats toward his shiny new Hummer.

                           CHRIS
             I asked you a question, you greedy
             son of a bitch!

                           WADE
             I'm greedy?! You're the one
             keeping us down so you can search
             for gold!

Chris tries to go after Wade.       Sam holds him back.

                           SAM
             Don't take another step.

Chris stares at her.

                           CHRIS
             You're taking his side?

                           SAM
             I'm trying to keep the peace.

                             WADE
             You're crazy!    Just like your
             father!

Wade drives off in his humvee.       The crowd begins to
disperse.

                            CHRIS
                    (sotto)
             He wasn't crazy.

                             SAM
             It's okay.

Chris heads off to his truck. Sam watches him go. Her
eyes drifting down his body. Ashley steps up beside her
mom.

                           ASHLEY
             Maybe you're not gay after all.

                           SAM
             What are you talking about?

             butt.

                           SAM
             Where did you learn that it's okay
             to talk to me like this?

                          ASHLEY
             Relax, Mom. He's hot for an old
             guy. I can admit it. Why can't
             you?

Sam watches Chris get into his truck. He gives her one
last look before pulling out. Sam smiles with her
daughter.


INT. MINING MUSEUM (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - DAY

Vintage mining gear. Walls covered with sepia-tone
photos chronicling the history of the McCormick mines.

GLADYS LAUDERBACK (50s) sits at a desk. She blows smoke
from her Kool into the breeze of an air conditioner.
Ignoring the signs behind her head: "NO SMOKING!",
"DANGER GAS!"

As Chris enters, Gladys hides her lit cigarette in a
drawer.

                           GLADYS
             Did you pop him one?

                           CHRIS
             He had it comin'. But Sam
             Palmer... That woman abuses her
             power.

                           GLADYS
             Why? Because she stopped you from
             givin' Wade another pop?

                           CHRIS
             I'm not proud of it.

Chris goes to a table and a map of the mines that
honeycomb beneath the town. Many of them are marked
"explored." Many aren't. Chris checks another tunnel
off the list. He sniffs the air and glares at Gladys.
Smoke rises out of her desk drawer. Gladys yanks it open
and puts out the flame.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           CHRIS
             I thought you were trying the
             patch.

                           GLADYS
             I am.

She raises her sleeve to reveal several nicotine patches.
Chris exits through a door at the back of the museum.


INT. MUSEUM - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Chris enters the family living quarters. The furniture
was new in 1947. He continues to the adjacent kitchen.


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

Chris takes a beer out of the fridge. Then he notices an
odd CLICKING. He tracks the sound to a stove burner
permanently on "light."

Chris moves to a fuse box in the adjacent hallway. He
removes the fuse for the stove. The SPARKING STOPS.

Chris sits at the table and has a cooling sip of beer.
Gladys enters with a stack of bills.

                           CHRIS
             That burner's on the fritz again.

                            GLADYS
             Oh something's broken? What else
             is new?
                     (lays bills on table)
             You need to pay these by the end
             of the month.

                           CHRIS
                    (looks at bills)
             Today... For a split second... I
             actually thought I had it.

                           GLADYS
             Another vein of iron pyrite?

                           CHRIS
             Yeah... Then a rat stole my lunch.
             I practically blew myself up
             trying to get it back.

             sandwiches.
                    (beat)
             Maybe you should talk to Wade.

                           CHRIS
             What are you saying?

                           GLADYS
             Honey, if he really does have a
             buyer...

                           CHRIS
             You of all people know how much my
             dad wanted to find that mother
             lode.

                           GLADYS
             Your daddy wanted to    get rich. I
             don't think he cared    how that
             happened. If he was     still alive,
             maybe he'd sell those    mines.

Chris takes umbrage...

                           CHRIS
             And maybe you didn't know him so
             well after all.

A tense beat.

                           GLADYS
             You're right... I'm just worried
             about how we're going to pay these
             bills.

                           CHRIS
             Don't give up on me, Gladys. I
             promised him I'd find the gold.
             And I will.

Gladys steels her fear, patting Chris on the hand.


EXT. TOWN - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAWN

The sun rises.     The town slowly comes to life.

             Good morning, Prosperity, Nevada.
             It's another beautiful day on the

Locals prepare their stores for business.

          No charges have been filed in
          yesterday's fracas between Chris
          McCormick and Wade Hale. And
          we've got...

Joshua turns the radio down. He holds a tape measure to
a glass spider tank, recording the size of an unseen
arac.

                        JOSHUA
          An exponential growth rate...
          That's impossible.

                         CHARLIE
          Me so horny.   Me love you long
          time.

Joshua doesn't look back at the parrot sitting on its
perch.

                        JOSHUA
          Be quiet, bird!

Charlie looks over at the tarantula tank. Watching
curiously as the cloth cover moves slightly. As if one
of the spiders is escaping. Charlie flies over to
investigate. He lands on the counter and peers around
the back of the tank.

                        CHARLIE
          Charlie's in the wire!     Incoming!

Something yanks the parrot O.S.

                        JOSHUA
          Stop screwing around...!

Joshua looks back in search of the parrot. He notices
several feathers floating down to the floor. He heads
over to investigate. Joshua pulls the blanket clear to
reveal the top of the cage has been pushed aside. No
sign of any tarantulas. Joshua checks the back side of
the tank.

                        JOSHUA
          Where'd you go? Consuela?

She's nowhere to be seen. Joshua spots      something
sticking out from under the table. Two      parrot feet.
Joshua pulls Charlie out from under the     table. It's a
horrible sight. The bird is wrapped in      spider webbing.
His body desiccated.

Joshua sees Charlie is attached to a web. He tugs on the
webline. Something tugs back. Joshua leans down to look
under the table. His eyes go wide at what he sees. Then
a shadow looms over his head. Joshua looks up and...

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - OUTSIDE PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Chris drives past.    He catches sight of a figure in a
window.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Sam is brushing her teeth at the window as Chris drives
by. They make eye contact. Chris moves on. Sam looks
at herself in the mirror. Bathrobe. No makeup. Messy
hair. Mouth full of toothpaste.

                              SAM
             Work it, babe.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sam comes out of the bathroom dressed in her uniform.

             It's all yours.

Ashley and Mike exit their rooms. Mike is dressed for
the day. Ashley in a robe. They race for the bathroom.
Mike is first. Then Ashley hip-checks him out of the
way, slamming the door in his face.

                              ASHLEY (O.S.)
             Ladies first.

                           SAM
             You still want a ride, Mike?

                           MIKE

                           SAM
             Have fun.

Mike heads down the hallway and out of the house.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Ashley turns on the shower, drops her robe, and climbs
in.


INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY

Ashley is surrounded by steam. She sings an edgy gangsta
rap tune by NWA. Tres' bizarre, non? Shampoo lather
cascades down her face. Her eyes close. She is
oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her. The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap.

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair. The lather
builds. Covering her face. Forcing her eyes closed once
more. The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes.

The water stops. Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web. She feels no
water coming out, and fumbles for a washcloth. Reaching
with eyes closed, she can't see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth. As Ashley retrieves it, the
spider scurries onto its opposite side.

Ashley wipes the soap off her face. The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand. Before it can
strike, Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth.

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider. As the
beast stares out from under it, barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth. Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                     26.

CONTINUED:

Ashley turns her attention to the showerhead. She cranks
the water handles, trying to get the water flowing again.
The handles suddenly pop off. Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor. Ashley shrieks in
horror.

Sam bursts into the bathroom and yanks open the shower
door. She drags Ashley out and looks at all the little
spiders.

                          SAM
             Now what?

Ashley just screams.


INT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - DAY

The SCREAM of a SAWZALL. A house in the midst of
remodeling. Sections of wall are exposed. Sheets cover
furniture. HANK (30s) is the Bob Villa-poseur.

A cat sits near an open section of wall. Watching
something intently. The cat charges into the wall after
unseen prey.

EMMA (30s) comes downstairs wearing her bathrobe. She
clutches her ears in pain, screaming for Hank to stop.
He can't hear. She grabs his shoulder and he STOPS
CUTTING.

                           EMMA
             Why do you need to do that as six
             in the morning!? Do you hate me
             that much!?

                           HANK
             I want to finish before I go to
             work.

                           EMMA
             You've been saying that for six
             months!

                           HANK
             I can't finish if you keep
             interrupting!

Hanks RESTARTS the SAW as Emma staggers into the kitchen.

                                                         27.

INT. REMODELED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Emma makes herself a hangover helper. Egg, tabasco,
lemon juice, and a shot of vodka. All of it goes into
the BLENDER. She FIRES it UP. Competing with the noise
of Hank's SAW. Then Emma notices a bowl of uneaten cat
food.


INT. REMODELED HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Emma comes back in and UNPLUGS the noisy SAW.

                        HANK
          If you're gonna keep pulling the
          plug...

                        EMMA
          Have you seen Zeke this morning?

                        HANK
          He was chasing something earlier.

                        EMMA
          If he got into the wall again,
          it's your balls in the blender.

They hear FAINT MEOWING. Hank traces the source.       It's
coming from behind a partially-dismantled wall.

                         HANK
          Hey, Zeke.   Breakfast is ready.

                        EMMA
          I'll get the tuna.

Emma heads back into the kitchen. Hank listens at the
wall. After a beat he hears the CAT RUSTLING around
inside.

                           HANK
          Zeke?

Emma re-enters with a can of tuna.       She hears ZEKE HISS.

                        EMMA
          What's wrong with him?

Hank shakes his head. The CAT noises become more
aggressive. The panicked couple tries to follow the
cat's progress. They tracks the sounds of BATTLE along
the wall. The noises become FRANTIC. SCRABBLING CLAWS.
HOWLS of KITTY pain.

                           HANK & EMMA
          Zeke!?   Zeke!    Zeke!

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                       28.

CONTINUED:

They follow the cat's frenzied movement up the wall,
across the ceiling, and down the other wall. Hank
hurries over. He can feel his cat thrashing maniacally
on the other side. A FELINE SCREAM. And then deafening
silence.

Hank tears open the drywall, reaching for his cat.

                           HANK
             I've got him by the tail.

He withdraws all that remains of the Zeker... a bloody
tail.


EXT. MALL - DAY

Mike hops off his bike before it stops moving. Letting
it crash in the dirt. He enters the mall through glass
doors.


INT. MALL (PROSPERITY) - DAY

Mike passes NORMAN (18), a janitor polishing the floors.
Norman listens to LOUD DEATH ROCK TUNES on a Sony
WALKMAN.

                           NORMAN
                    (conspiratorial)
             Hey, dude. Yeah. You.

Mike comes over to this goatee'd rascal.

                           NORMAN
             Wanna buy some smoke?

                           MIKE
             A pack of cigarettes?

                           NORMAN
             Smoke to get high, not to die. My
             stuff is hydroponically grown in a
             top secret location. No
             artificial flavors. No
             preservatives. Just 110 percent
             homegrown.

                           MIKE
             Where's this secret location?

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                                29.

CONTINUED:

                           NORMAN
             I could have a dime bag for you
             toot sweet. But if I tell you
             where exactly, I'd have to kill
             you.

                           MIKE
             Norman, you know my mom's the
             sheriff.

                           NORMAN
             Oh yeah... Right on...
                    (considers this)
             Does she get high?

Mike walks away, deeper into the mall. A dozen stores
line the hallway: Victoria's Secret, Electronic
Boutique, Sport Chalet. Most of the stores are closed
for good. A large atrium features a fountain and jungle
gym. Skylights cover the ceiling. Mike enters the Home
and Garden store.


INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE - DAY

Mike goes up to the counter.          The CLERK snaps at him.

                           CLERK
             The bug spray is on aisle five!

                              MIKE
             What?

                           CLERK
             You want mousetraps!?       Is that
             it?! Aisle five!

Mike grabs some batteries and lays them on the counter.

                              CLERK
             Oh.     I thought you wanted...

An OLD LADY walks past.

                           OLD LADY
             Excuse me, young man. Where can I
             find the bug spray?

                              CLERK
             Aisle five!

The Clerk grabs the PA's microphone.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                    30.

CONTINUED:

                           CLERK
                    (over PA speakers)
             All bug spray, rodent traps, ant
             poison and fly paper is on aisle
             five!

He returns his attention to Mike.

                           CLERK
             That'll be three fifty-two.

Mike pays the man.

                           MIKE
             Where's aisle five?

The annoyed Clerk points. Mike heads over. He sees the
aisle is crowded with locals squabbling over the few
remaining cans of Raid, Black Flag and Off.


EXT. BEVERLY'S HOUSE (TOWN) - DAY

Beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. She sprays her
vegetable garden with water. After a beat, a solid
object is coughed up through the hose.

Beverly continues watering. Two more unidentified
objects are spewed from the hose. She reacts by cranking
the spigot on full. The water sprays harder. Then
inexplicably stops.

Beverly checks the spigot. She looks into the opening of
the hose. Puts it to her ear and listens. Sniffs. Now
she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage.

Beverly removes the hose. A FAINT RUMBLING sound. She
puts it back in her mouth and sucks. A solid object
comes through the hose and into her mouth. Then another.
And another. A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth.

Beverly yanks it out. Water spews from her mouth and out
of the hose. Apparently the blockage has cleared.

Beverly falls to her knees. Hunching forward. She
vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small
spiders. Mouth agape. Eyes wide in horror. She watches
them scurry into the garden. Beverly tries to scream...
but can only retch.

                                                        31.

EXT. STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike Palmer rides his bike through a puddle of water. He
sees Beverly throwing up in her vegetable garden. Mike
it thoroughly grossed out.


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - DAY

Mike rides his bike into Joshua's front yard.    He
dismounts before the BIKE stops. It CRASHES.     Mike heads
inside.


INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY

Mike stops short in the doorway. An off-hook TELEPHONE
BEEPS incessantly. WIND MOANS through shattered windows.
Furniture is tipped over. Mike moves through the chaos.

                         MIKE
          Hello?   Joshua? Charlie?

The spider tanks are shattered. No trace of their
occupants. Mike pulls out his Cassiopeia PDA and starts
recording.

                        MIKE
                 (into PDA)
          Captain's log. Stardate...

Stops recording, PLAYS it BACK, listens to HIS VOICE.

                           MIKE
          Cool!
                 (records again)
          The house is deserted. No sign of
          Joshua Taft or his bird. The
          spider tanks are shattered. There
          is broken glass everywhere.

Mike moves toward the back door of the cabin.    It swings
open and shut in the WIND.


EXT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE (DESERT) - BACK YARD - DAY

Mike comes out and notices hundreds of coin-sized
footprints. He follows these tracks to a cluster of
wooden barricades labeled: "McCORMICK AND SONS MINING
COMPANY." Mike peers toward a vertical mine shaft behind
the barriers.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       32.

CONTINUED:

                           MIKE
                    (into PDA)
             Animal tracks. Definitely too big
             to be spiders. Could be rats.

Mike slips past the barricades. Following the tracks to
the edge of the abyss. He can't see anything. It's too
dark.

Mike turns away and returns to the yard.    Never
realizing...

Several feet down the shaft. Hidden under a rock... the
shriveled and desiccated corpse of Joshua Taft. It hangs
from the side of the shaft in thick sticky webbing.
Grisly.

Suddenly the corpse is tugged loose and dragged deeper
into the shaft by some unseen creature.


EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris's pickup is parked outside another mine shaft.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAY

Chris works with   his pick-axe. He pauses, listening to a
DISTURBING NOISE   somewhere down the tunnel. A growl? A
roar? Chris isn'   t so sure. And then a new sound... a
SCREECHING. The    noise grows LOUDER. Something's coming.

Chris shines his light into the darkness. Trying to see
what's causing the unsettling crescendo...

Suddenly dozens of RATS burst from the darkness.


EXT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

Chris runs out the mouth of the tunnel. The rat stampede
is on his tail. He leaps into the back of his pickup.
The manic rodents continue off into the desert.

Chris looks back toward the gaping mouth of the tunnel.

                           CHRIS
             What am I, the Pied Piper...

                                                        33.

EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - BARBER SHOP - DAY

Mike rides his bike. Floyd the barber stands out front
chatting with an elderly couple. They hold a dog's leash
in their hand.

                         FLOYD
          I'm sorry.   I haven't seen him.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Mike rides on. He notices a guy taping a flyer to a lamp
post. Mike glances over. It's a sign for a missing dog.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - POLICE STATION - DAY

Mike arrives at the local police station. Several cars
are parked out front. The door is ajar. Locals are
crowded inside. Mike lets his bike crash as he enters.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is behind her desk.   The place is swarming with
locals.

                         SAM
          Quiet!   Quiet please!

The mob is not listening.

                        BEVERLY
          They were clogging up my house!

                        EMMA
          I want to know what killed Zeke!

                        TRAVIS
          He was a good dog! He wouldn't
          just get up and go!

Deputy Pete whistles at top volume.   Everybody shuts up.

                        SAM
          I had spiders at my house too.     We
          need an exterminator not a
          sheriff.

                        TRAVIS
          What about my dog?

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                     34.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             I don't know, Travis. We're gonna
             keep an eye out. But we're not
             gettin' anywhere like this. You
             should go back out there and look
             for your animals. If they haven't
             shown up by tonight. I'll call
             Fish and Game. Okay?

Pete ushers the grumbling mob out of the office.   Mike
avoids the crush and manages to stay inside.

                           MIKE
             Mom! Mom!   All Josh's spiders are
             gone!

                           SAM
             I can't do this right now, Mike!
             Everyone's having pest problems!

                           MIKE
             But Joshua is gone!

                           SAM
             Maybe he's out looking for his
             spiders?

                           MIKE
             Mom, I'm serious! You're not
             listening!

                           SAM
             Mike... I've got missing pets.
             Spiders in the plumbing. Rats and
             mice coming out of basements. And
             your sister's about to end up on a
             milk carton. I can't have you
             losing...

The PHONE RINGS.     Sam answers it.

                           SAM
             Hello? Wade... wait a second...
             your ostriches?

OFF Mike's look.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Prosperity is clearly visible just a mile away. The
police car drives down a long road lined with fences.

                                                       35.

EXT. WADE'S RANCH - RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Wade's new Hummer is in the driveway. A CATTLE DOG BARKS
as Wade leads Sam and Mike around the side of the house.

                        WADE
          Came out to feed my birds this
          morning.

                         SAM
          Coyotes?

                         WADE
          Hell no!

The trio steps to the fence.    Only three mangy ostriches
are there to greet them.

                        WADE
          My flock had fifty birds! Where'd
          they go, dammit! Who the hell
          steals fifty birds that can't even
          fly!?

                        SAM
          All this happened last night?

                         WADE
          I guess.   And we didn't hear a
          thing.

Sam gestures toward the BARKING DOG.

                        SAM
          What about him?

                         WADE
          Not a peep.

Mike notices some ostrich feathers on the ground.     He
heads over for a closer look.

The DOG watches his progress.    BARKING excitedly.

Sam talks to Wade.

                        SAM
          How's the ostrich business?

                        WADE
          Not so good lately.

                        SAM
          You've got that new Hummer. You
          must be makin' enough to pay for
          it.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                       36.

                           WADE
                    (annoyed)
             You like it? I'll take you for a
             ride.

                           SAM
             These birds are insured.   Right?

                           WADE
             I didn't kill my birds, Sam.      Is
             that what you think?

Mike looks back to see his mom confronting Wade.

                           WADE
                    (in the distance)
             ... reject... absolutely not...

Mike scrutinizes what appear to be more of those tracks
that he found at Joshua's. But this time they are
larger:

                           MIKE
                    (into PDA)
             I've found more tracks.    Even
             larger now.

Mike follows the trail toward another mine entrance.
This one is plugged with concrete. The tracks don't go
there. They stop at what appears to be a normal patch of
ground. Several ostrich feathers are scattered nearby.

Mike takes a closer    look. Something doesn't seem right.
An odd demarcation    in the soil. His fingers trace the
edge of a thin film    of material. It is a lid of sorts.
A sheath of sticky    webbing coated with dirt. Mike is
able to lift it.

Mike peers into a deep dark burrow three feet wide.

The BARKING CATTLE DOG SNAPS its TETHER and charges Mike.
Sam and Wade see this and run after it.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike doesn't see the dog.    He's too busy looking in the
hole.


INT. UNDERGROUND BURROW - TRAPDOOR SPIDER POV - MIKE

The kid is FRAMED IN the burrow opening just a few feet
away.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - OSTRICH PEN - DAY

Mike senses something approaching in the darkness.
Suddenly he's grabbed from behind. Sam drags him away as
CLYDE the cattle dog continues BARKING.

                        WADE
                 (to Clyde)
          Now you're on the job?! What the
          hell were you doin' last night?!

                           SAM
          Come on, Mike.     Let's hit it.

Sam leads her son toward the house.     Mike glances back.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Mike and Sam are in the cop car.     Wade is at Sam's
window.

                        WADE
          I need to know what happened to my
          birds!

                    (a beat)
             So you can fill out that insurance
             form.

Sam drives down the driveway. Wade takes off his hat and
wipes his brow. He watches Clyde run parallel to the
accelerating police car.


INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Sam eyes the road ahead.     Mike is lost in thought.

                           MIKE
             We have to go back.

                           SAM
             Mike?

                           MIKE
             That was a trapdoor spider's
             burrow.

                           SAM
             What are you talking about?

                           MIKE
             Joshua was feeding his spiders
             bugs from the creek. And they
             were getting bigger.

Mike glances out the window at the dog running nearby.

                           MIKE
                    (agitated)
             What if they didn't stop growing?
             What if they broke out of their
             tanks. Ate Joshua. And went into
             the mines?

Sam looks at him like he's out of his mind.

                           MIKE
             That could be why the other
             species are coming out into the
             open. They're trying to get away
             from the giant spiders.
                    (a beat)
             The ecosystem is out of balance.

             Ritalin?

She checks him for a fever.


EXT. WADE'S RANCH - DIRT DRIVEWAY - FENCE LINE - DAY

CLYDE runs   next to the car. Suddenly he disappears
underground   with a YELP. Only still frame on a DVD
player will   capture the trapdoor spider's lunge from a
camouflaged   den. The dog's empty collar rolls to a stop
in a cloud   of dust.


INT. POLICE CAR (DIRT DRIVEWAY) - DAY

Mike turns from his mother and looks out the window.        He
is confused when he doesn't see any sign of the dog.

                           MIKE
             Maybe I am losing it...

He checks himself for a fever.


INT. ABANDONED TRUCK STOP (DESERT) - DAY

A dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and
rock. The structures have boarded windows. Graffiti on
the walls. Teenagers hang out. Off-road motorcycles
parked nearby.

Bret Hale's monster truck does donuts in the parking lot.
Ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with
glee.


INT. BRET'S TRUCK (TRUCK STOP) - DAY

Bret smokes a Phillies Blunt as he donuts his TRUCK.
Ashley laughs hysterically. Bret steers them around to
the back of the truck stop. He SKIDS to a stop.

                           ASHLEY
             Woo-hoo!

Bret offers his stogie.    Ashley refuses.     Bret puffs
away.

                           ASHLEY
             Haven't you had enough of that?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                           40.

CONTINUED:

                              BRET
             No such thing.     Norman's bud is
             da'kine.

He coughs and they both laugh.

                           BRET
             When I medal at the X-Games, Honda
             will give me full sponsorship.
             Then I'll take you with me on the
             Supercross tour.

Ashley is silent.

                           BRET
             Are you still thinking about going
             away?

                           ASHLEY
             I don't know. I want to do
             something with my life, Bret.
             Help people. Maybe med school is
             still an option.

                           BRET
             Not if you keep hanging out with
             me.

                              ASHLEY
             Thanks, Mom.

They kiss. Things head toward a serious        level of "get
down." Bret slides his hand up Ashley's        shirt. Ashley
gets into it. But then Bret slides his        hand toward the
buttons of her 501s. Ashley removes his        hand.

                              ASHLEY
             Slow down...

Bret persists.       Ashley climbs off of him.

                           BRET
             I thought you loved me.

                              ASHLEY
             I do!

                           BRET
             Then what's the problem? You want
             to leave town. You don't want to
             make out.

                           ASHLEY
             I don't feel...

             What?

                           ASHLEY
             I don't want to lose my virginity
             in the front seat of a monster
             truck.

                           BRET
             Why didn't you say so? We can go
             outside. I've got a blanket in
             the back.

                           ASHLEY
             No... I guess... I'm just not
             ready.

                           BRET
             Tammy and Larry do it every night!

                           ASHLEY
             Then call them! Have a menage a
             trois!

                             BRET
             Come on,   Ashley. Mommy's not
             around.    You don't have to play
             the good   girl. Let Daddy give you
             what you   really want.

Bret goes after her once more.      Ashley's not into it.

                           ASHLEY
             Please, Bret... Please don't...

But Bret won't listen. Ashley isn't strong enough to
fight him. She reaches into her purse and pulls out her
stun gun. She rams it up in Bret's crotch and pulls the
trigger.

Bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. He
spasmodically jerks off of Ashley and tumbles out the
driver's side door.


EXT. BEHIND TRUCK STOP - DAY

Bret twitches on the ground.

                           BRET
             My balls? Ahh! My balls!
                    (looks down)
             I pissed myself?! Damn, bee-otch!

CONTINUED:

Ashley watches from the truck.

                           ASHLEY
             I told you to back off!

Ashley closes the door of the truck and rolls up the
windows.

Bret is dazed as he gets to his feet. Then his eyes
rack-focus to a nearby dune. A Rottweiler-sized jumping
spider stands atop it. Two large eyes surrounded by six
smaller orbs. Orange and black designs on its abdomen.
Wiry hair. Dagger-sized fangs. Bret can't quite believe
what he sees.

Ashley STARTS the TRUCK.      This snaps Bret back to
reality.

                             BRET
             Ashley, wait!

                           ASHLEY
             Screw you, Bret. I'm going home.

Bret sees the spider leisurely coming down off the dune.
He runs over to the door of the pickup and tries to open
it.

                            BRET
             Please!   Open the door!     I'm
             sorry!

                           ASHLEY
             I can't believe my mom was right
             about you. Do you know how
             embarrassing that is?

Ashley starts to pull away.         Bret keeps banging on the
glass.

                           BRET
             Open the door, baby!      I love you!
             I want to marry you!      Have my
             children! Please!

Ashley flips him the bird and BURNS RUBBER. As the truck
moves out of the way, Bret finds himself staring at
several more jumping spiders that are methodically
approaching. Bret sprints around to the other side of
the truck stop.

                                                         43.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bret runs from behind the building.    Larry Witzer and a
bunch of other kids see him coming.

                          LARRY
            Dude, did you piss in your pants?

                           RANDY
            Ha-ha!   Bret pissed his pants!

All the kids start laughing and pointing at Bret.      None
of them see the approaching jumping spiders.

                          BRET
            Get out of here! They're coming!

                          RANDY
            The only one coming is you, dude.

Larry and Randy high-five. A jumping spider lands on
Randy's back, piercing him with its fangs, throwing him
to the ground. Randy screams. The kids have a front-row
seat as the spider's pincers mash their buddy into an
edible pulp.

Bret leaps onto his MOTORCYCLE and FIRES it UP. Several
more jumping spiders bound across the parking lot.

                           BRET
            Ride!

The kids scramble, leaping onto their bikes. One rider
is picked off by a spider. The others kick up rooster
tails as they accelerate away. The spiders chase them
into the dunes.


EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY

A wasteland on the outskirts of town. The sandy waves
are "surfed" by the noisy MOTORCYCLES. The jumping
spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single
bound.

A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.     The BIKE CRASHES.

Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker
tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into
the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But
then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a
hungry jumper.

Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back
and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody
murder.

                                                (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Bret sees Larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand.
Bret is the only human left. A jumper comes after him in
mid-air. Bret does an X-Games style rocket air, kicking
backward with booted legs. He knocks the spider away and
keeps on riding.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Three familiar trucks cruise down the highway.     This time
they are devoid of any toxic waste cargo.


INT. THIRD TRUCK - HIGHWAY - DAY

Pig Pen stares fixedly at the endless road ahead of him.

                           SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
             I will live every moment of my
             life as if it were my last.

                           PIG PEN
             I will live every moment of my
             life as if it were my last.

Suddenly Bret Hale wheelies across the road. A jumping
spider explodes against the windshield. Spider guts
splatter everywhere. Pig Pen screams as he JAMS on the
BRAKES.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The TRUCK jack-knifes into a line of telephone poles.
Knocking them over and rolling multiple times before
EXPLODING. Several jumping spiders are caught in the
blast. Bret Hale rides on with several more jumpers
behind.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

The black and white classic: Tarantula, plays over an
old TV and VCR. Mike is at his computer, downloading a
spider encyclopedia into his PDA. A message flashes
across the screen: CONNECTION LOST. Mike picks up the
telephone.

                               MIKE
             Hello?   Hello?

The line is dead.

                                                     45.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Bret rides into a dead-end canyon with the spiders very
close behind. Bret steers for the mouth of a hillside
mine shaft.


INT HORIZONTAL MINE SHAFT - DAY

Bret speeds inside. He looks over his shoulder to check
for his pursuers, they're gone. Bret looks relieved. He
faces forward as... whack! A support beam knocks him
from his bike. The bike continues on into the tunnel
alone. From the sound of things it travels pretty far
before crashing.

Bret lies on the ground as dust settles onto his face.
He looks up at a support beam which begins to crack.
Bret moves clear just as the ceiling caves in, sealing
him in the mine.


EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Several locals put up more signs for missing pets.


INT. DINER/EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY

Harlan is kibitzing with Travis. Pete and Emma console
each other over dessert. Wade sits alone at a table for
two. The attractive WAITRESS on roller-skates give him a
fresh beer.

                        WAITRESS
          The phones went down for some
          reason. Maybe that's why Bret
          didn't call. Did you want to go
          ahead and order?

                        WADE
          Just give me the usual.

                        WAITRESS
          One ostrich steak, comin' up.

Wade reacts glumly to the word "ostrich."

             Not as good that way.

Chris goes through a nearby door to the basement.


INT. MUSEUM - BASEMENT - DAY

Chris comes downstairs. He rummages through some junk.
comes up with several rat traps. He turns around to
discover an odd hole in the wall. He ventures over for a
look.

                           CHRIS
             Rats...

Chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his
entry.

Chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large
male tarantula on his back. Chris is oblivious as he
takes off his jacket. The coat lands in a heap atop the
spider.

Chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in
the hole. He doesn't notice the jacket moving behind
him.

Chris backs out of the hole. He picks up his jacket.
The spider is gone. He grabs his traps and heads
upstairs.

                                                       47.

Chris hesitates.

                        CHRIS
          What?

                        GLADYS
          You two should just sleep together
          and get it over with.

                        CHRIS
          Me and Sam... Hook up...

                         GLADYS
          I may be older than electricity,
          but I used to be a nice-looking
          piece of tail.

                        CHRIS
          Too much information.

                           GLADYS
             I'm not kidding. I got more
             action than those chicks on VIP.
             So when I tell you Sam thinks your
             butt is U.S.D.A. choice...

                           CHRIS
             This is where I throw up.

                           GLADYS
             Don't tell me you don't think
             she's a fox.

Chris mulls this over.   Testing his own feelings. He
opens his mouth to ask another question. And then heads
out.

                           GLADYS
             See you for dinner.

Gladys doesn't notice the basement DOOR CREAK open
slightly.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Sam is on the phone at her desk.

                           SAM
             Nothing yet. I'm sorry.     We're
             still trying to get...

Chris enters.

                           SAM
             Let me call you back.
                    (hangs up)
             This has been one crazy day.
             We've got missing pets, dead
             ostriches. God only knows what's
             next.

                           CHRIS
             I'm sorry about yesterday. Wade
             is... He knows how to push my
             buttons.

                           SAM
             I wanted to ask you...

                           CHRIS
             On a date?

Sam freezes for a second.     Chris laughs.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           49.

CONTINUED:

                            CHRIS
             I'm kidding.   What did you want to
             ask?

                           SAM
             Have you noticed anything strange
             in the mines?

                           CHRIS
             Define strange.

                           SAM
             I had spiders in my house. Hector
             had roaches in his basement. Some
             mice...

                           CHRIS
             How about stampeding rats?

                           SAM
             Were they running away from
             something?

                           CHRIS
             Could have been. Never saw them
             do that before. I guess it
             qualifies as strange.

Sam thinks this over.

                           CHRIS
             Sam... Do you want to go out
             sometime?

                           SAM
                    (taken aback)
             Are you asking me out on a date?

                           CHRIS
             Only if you're going to say yes.

Sam smiles slightly.


INT. MUSEUM - KITCHEN - DAY

The basement door is wide open. Gladys mixes food in a
bowl. A cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip.

A male tarantula moves across the ceiling. The creature
is the size of a pit bull. Two quivering palps flank
dart-sized fangs. Multiple eyes the size of quarters.
Hair all over.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        50.

CONTINUED:

Gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. As
she works, the spider shadows her. Every time the spider
is about to strike, she goes another direction to get
spices, utensils, a pan.

Gladys places her bowl on the stove. Suddenly the
tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her.
Gladys shrieks. The tarantula lashes out at her. Gladys
grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward. The spider reels, striking the burner
knobs, turning on the gas.

Gladys registers the sound of ESCAPING GAS. She looks
back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. As she
goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her.

Gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the
webline prevents her from slotting it home.

Gladys strains with all    her might, finally slots the
fuse. She turns toward     the kitchen just in time to see
the broken burner spark    to life. The gas ignites. The
tarantula is engulfed in    flame.

Gladys is knocked down by the blast. She lies on her
back when a second male tarantula nails her with a
webline. Gladys screams as she's dragged across the
floor toward the basement door.

The fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

                           CHRIS
             So that's a 'No.'

                           SAM
             My kids are the world to me,
             Chris. When their dad left... it
             really took a toll. On all of us.
             I can't go through that again. I
             won't.

                           CHRIS
             No... I understand... I don't know
             what I was thinking...
                    (laughs)
             Gladys has some crazy ideas. I'm
             gonna kill her.

Deputy Pete throws open the door.

             The museum's on fire!

OFF Chris's look.


EXT. BURNING MUSEUM - DAY

The museum burns. The volunteer fire department attacks
the conflagration. All the locals are there to help.

Sam's COP CAR SKIDS to a stop. Chris leaps out. Stares
at the fire for a beat. And then he charges toward the
inferno. Sam tackles him from behind. Pinning him to
the ground.

                            CHRIS
             No!   Let me go! Gladys!   Let me
             go!

The museum collapses.     Chris watches it burn to the
ground.


EXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)

The fire is out. The once-proud building is now a
smoldering pile of rubble. Locals stand in small groups.

Chris wanders through the ruins as    firemen mop up. He
picks something out of the char.     The map of the mines.
Almost completely burned. Soaked     with water. He stares
at it for a heavy beat. All that     remains of his legacy.
Sam steps up.

                           SAM
             Maybe she got out.

Sam puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.

                            CHRIS
                     (devastated)
             She was cooking. The stove was
             broken.

                           SAM
             Why don't you come home with me?
             We'll get you cleaned up.

Chris hesitates for a moment. And then he lets the map
fall. He walks out of the ruins with Sam.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            52.

CONTINUED:

Mike stands off to the side. He spots something near the
edge of the ruins. He goes over to pick it up. It's a
piece of arachnid exoskeleton. A spider's leg. Big.
Very big. Travis the fire chief warns him away.

                           TRAVIS
             Get away from there, Mike!

Mike hurries clear with his prize. He puts it on the
ground, sketches the outline of a spider to fit the scale
of the leg.

                             MIKE
             Holy God...

Mike looks around for his mom.         He sees her driving off
in the cop car with Chris.

                             MIKE
             Mom!   Wait!


EXT. PALMER HOUSE - DUSK

The sun hangs low in the sky.         Sam's cop car parks beside
Bret's monster truck.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - DAY

Ashley watches TV. A doctor resuscitates a dying patient
with CPR. The doctor counts as he pumps the man's chest.

                           TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
             One... two... three...

Ashley watches intently.       The patient is revived.

                           TV DOCTOR (V.O.)
             Helping people never gets old.

Ashley hears KEYS in the front DOOR. She quickly
switches channels to MTV. Sam enters with Chris.

                             SAM
             Is Bret here?

                             ASHLEY
             No.

                           SAM
             Then why is his truck out front?

             Don't worry about it.

                           SAM
             What do you mean?     What happened?

                            ASHLEY
             Nothing.

Ashley starts crying. Sam goes to comfort her daughter.
Chris stands by in shock. Watching, Upset.

                           ASHLEY
             Nothing happened, alright!

Ashley runs off to her room.       Sam follows.

Chris stands alone for a beat. He walks to the kitchen
and pulls a bottle of Vodka from the freezer. He puts
the cold bottle against his head and neck. Trying to
cool off.

Mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of
exoskeleton. He sees Chris opening the bottle of vodka.

                           MIKE
             Spiders shed their skins when they
             grow.

Chris looks at Mike for a moment.

                            MIKE
             Like snakes.

                           CHRIS
             Gladys is dead.

Chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.

                            MIKE
             Maybe not.

That got Chris's attention.

                           MIKE
             This is a tarantula's leg. Or it
             was. It's an exoskeleton, to be
             scientific.

                           CHRIS
             It's a little large.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Chris has another gulp of vodka as Mike holds up his
Cassiopeia full of spider data. He shows Chris a video
of a male tarantula mummifying its food. Chris watches
in amazement.

                           MIKE
             See! Male tarantulas wrap their
             prey in webbing. Tight like a
             mummy. The food stays alive so
             they can eat it later.

Sam enters the room in time to overhear this.

                             SAM
             Mike, please.    Now isn't the time.

Chris looks up at Sam.

                           CHRIS
             They keep their food alive.

Mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.

                             SAM
             What is this?

                           MIKE
             A spider's leg!

Sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.

                             MIKE
             Careful!

                           SAM
             No. That's a piece of cactus.
             Look... It's covered with spines.

                           MIKE
             Those are quills! Tarantulas can
             flick them at you like darts!

Mike does an odd flicking motion.       Kind of like a dog
scratching a flea.

                           SAM
             Giant tarantulas?

                           MIKE
             Tarantulas! Wolfs! Trapdoors!
             Joshua had a ton of exotics!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

             If there were giant spiders
             roaming the desert, don't you
             think somebody would've seen them
             by now?

                           MIKE
             The jumpers hunt in daylight. But
             not the others. They only come
             out when the sun goes down!

The group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the
sky.


EXT. TOWN - DUSK

Prosperity is bathed in sunset. The mine shaft entrances
are clearly visible. Like black holes of malevolent
promise.


INT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.
Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's
clothes.

                           SAM
             I guess I should watch more
             'Oprah.' It must be a textbook
             'no-dad' kind of thing.

Chris shifts awkwardly.     In shock.   Sad.   Sam holds up a
flannel shirt.

                           CHRIS
             That one looks kind of scratchy.

Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.

                           SAM
             All Jason cared about was getting
             out and starting over. I guess
             that included buying a new
             wardrobe.

Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning
up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't
register Sam ogling his exposed chest.

             Gladys thought I should sell...
             but you know... I never wanted to
             get rich. If it was about the
             money, I would have sold out to
             Wade a long time ago.

Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.

                           CHRIS
             I think I just wanted to prove the
             gold was down there. That my
             family wasn't crazy to keep
             looking. Even after we'd lost so
             much. And now... she's gone, too.

                           SAM
             I'm sorry, Chris.

                           CHRIS
             Do you know what I'm trying to
             say?

                           SAM
             It wasn't about spending the gold,
             it was about finding it.

                             CHRIS
             That's right.    That's exactly
             right.

Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's
struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but
catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.

                           CHRIS
             Remind me never to let you do my
             laundry.

She turns, only to see him in a mirror. He steps out
from behind the car. Sam stares at him.

                           SAM
             They look great.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - SUNSET

A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley
sits on her bed with her back to the open window. The
sun setting in the distance. She rips up the photographs
of Bret.

Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting
spider crawling in through her window. It is striped
like a jungle predator.

It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among
Ashley's stuffed animal collection.


INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DUSK

Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his
computer, entering the specification of the piece of
exoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider grows
on his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big the
spider would be after shedding this skin. Mike is
distracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley's room.

             I'm doing spider research!

Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley
grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She
returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with
scissors.

The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and
mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns
around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes
momentarily.

                            ASHLEY
                    (sotto)
             Spider... Mike... Spider...

Ashley sees her stun gun is on   the dresser. She lunges
for it. She's almost got it.     The spider squirts two
lines of gummy web at Ashley.    The glop hits her int he
chest, carries her backward.    Glues her to the wall.


INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Chris finishes   dressing. He faces Sam. There is an odd
moment as they   find themselves standing close. If the
circumstances   were different they'd probably end up
kissing. And    then they hear ASHLEY'S bloodcurdling
SCREAM.

                                                     58.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Mike pops out of his door. Sam and Chris run down the
hallway. Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Sam, Chris and Mike stand in the doorway staring at a
giant spider menacing Ashley. The spitter fires another
webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall.

                         MIKE
          Wow!   A scytodes spitter!

Chris pushes past Sam and Mike. He grabs a chair and
shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer. The spider
backs off. Sam takes off running down the hallway.

                        ASHLEY
          Where are you going?


INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam runs up to find a gun case. She tries to get a
shotgun, but finds it locked. She doesn't have the key.
Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to
pieces.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider.
With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the
webbing. Mike stands nearby reading from his Cassiopeia.

                        MIKE
          The scytodes spits a gooey
          discharge to immobilize their
          prey.

                         ASHLEY
          No shit!

The spider hits Chris's chair with a blast of webbing.
The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.
Chris stands weaponless before the spider.

                        ASHLEY
          Use my stun g...

Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo.
Mouth sealed shut. Chris reaches under the bed and
pushes it over on to the spitter. The spider leaps clear
onto the wall.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                       59.

CONTINUED:

                            MIKE
                    (reads)
             Watch its fangs! The spitter's
             fangs move from side to side as it
             fires!

                           CHRIS
             I'll keep that in mind.

Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the
wall. The spider turns to fight. Chris wrestles it to
the ground. He sees the fangs begin to move from side to
side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.


INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning
roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its
binding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from the
room.


INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He
looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the
spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung
across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of
his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab
for his scissors. He gets them.

                           MIKE
             Get under it! Stab it in the
             abdomen! They don't have any
             armor down there!

                           CHRIS
             How am I supposed to do that!?

The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.
Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the
door with her shotgun. Chris is covered in spider guts.

                           CHRIS
             I'm gonna need some new pants.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then
pops a fresh clip into her 9mm. Chris comes out of the
garage wearing clean clothes. Sam chucks him the pistol.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             Ever used one of these?

                           CHRIS
             I'm a fast learner.

Chris tries to put the gun in his pocket. And then his
waistband. But these damn pants are too tight.

Ashley uses scissors to cut web out of her hair.

                           MIKE
             I told you! I told you all!     But
             nobody ever listens to Mike!
             Still think I'm crazy, Mom?

                           SAM
             I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

Ashley is about to hyperventilate.

                           SAM
             Calm down, baby.

                           ASHLEY
             There aren't enough wine coolers
             in the world to calm me down!

                           SAM
             I won't let anything happen to
             you.

Sam ka-chacks a fresh round into her shotgun.

                           CHRIS
             What other spiders did Joshua
             have?

                           MIKE
             Spitters, jumpers, orb weavers,
             tarantulas...

                           CHRIS
             Why couldn't he keep goldfish like
             a normal person?

Sam checks the phone.     It's dead.

                           SAM
             We need to warn people.

                           CHRIS
             How about the radio station?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                61.

CONTINUED:

                             SAM
             Good one.    We'll go to Harlan's.

                             ASHLEY
             Outside?    You want to go outside?


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - PALMER HOUSE- NIGHT

Chris and Sam open the front door of the house.          Sam
looks one way. Chris the other.

No giant spiders lurking about. Chris and Sam continue
onto the lawn. Mike and Ashley watch from the safety of
the doorway. They listen to the comforting SOUNDS OF a
SUMMER NIGHT.

                             SAM
             It's okay...

Mike and Ashley move out of the doorway.          Joining the
adults. They move toward the cop car.


EXT. STREETS (TOWN) - NIGHT

The cop car cruises. The occupants peer out the windows.
Everything appears normal. Although no people are
visible.


EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam, Chris, and the kids move away from the cop car to
the door. They are at the far end of town. All appears
to be normal.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Harlan is broadcasting.

                           HARLAN
             ... I'm saying the invasion has
             already occurred. The aliens are
             among us. But they've taken
             common forms. They hide in plain
             sight.

Harlan is startled as Sam and the others enter with guns.

                           SAM
             We need to make an emergency
             broadcast.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                        62.

CONTINUED:

                              HARLAN
             What happened?

                           MIKE
             Giant spider invasion.

Harlan's jaw drops.    Sam takes the microphone.

                           CHRIS
             What are you going to say?   You
             can't tell them the truth.

                           SAM
                    (into microphone)
             Is this thing on? Hello? This is
             Sam Palmer. We have an emergency
             situation.


EXT. STREET (TOWN) - NIGHT

                           SAM (V.O.)
             A pack of rabid coyotes is loose
             in town.

Wolf spiders crawl across rooftops. Spitters scale
buildings Tarantulas lurk in the shadows. Jumpers
scuttle out of the mineshafts. Trapdoors prepare their
burrows.


INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             They are extremely dangerous.

The forelegs of a tarantula reach over the top of the
man's recliner, yanking him clean out. The woman is
oblivious as her husband is dragged away across the
floor.


EXT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - NIGHT

Emma bursts out of the front door, screaming
hysterically. Hank is behind her with the SawzAll. A
wolf spider crawls after them from inside the house.

                           SAM (V.O.)
             Arm yourselves with any weapons
             you can find.

Hank raises the saw, overextending the power cable.   He
loses power. Drops the saw and runs for his life.

                                                        63.

INT. BARBERSHOP - NIGHT

Floyd and Leroy use brooms to fend off several wolf
spiders.

                        SAM (V.O.)
          Stay together and head for the
          mall.


INT. DINER - NIGHT

A spider eats the chef. The waitress roller-skates away
from an arachnid. She jumps through the window into the
street.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A family piles into their mini-van. Oblivious to the
jumper hiding in the "way back." They close the door and
drive off.


INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.

                          CHRIS
          The mall?

                        SAM
          The walls are concrete and the
          exits have steel gates. We could
          hold an entire army of giant
          spiders from inside.

                        ASHLEY
          You just said giant spider on the
          air.

Sam sees the microphone is keyed.

                        HARLAN
          Now that's great radio!

                        SAM
          Not giant spiders!      I meant to
          say...

Harlan notices long spider legs passing the window.

                          HARLAN
          The aliens!

                                                       64.

EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Sam and the    others spill out of the trailer. They head
for the cop    car. As they get closer, a wolf spider
climbs onto    the car's roof and gnaws on the light bar.
Sam raises    her gun to blast it.

                        MIKE
          Wait, Mom! The noise will attract
          more of them!

                        CHRIS
          Let's try for the mall.

Sam leads the others toward town.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Chris and Sam hang onto the panicked kids. Harlan brings
up the rear. The place is chaos. People are chased by
spiders. Dragged by spiders. Killed by spiders. Eaten
by spiders.

                        CHRIS
          My truck's at the museum.

                           SAM
          Your keys?

                        CHRIS
          In my other pants.

                           MIKE
          Look out!

The group flees a trio of goo-firing spitters.    Suddenly
a familiar mini-van races past.

                          HARLAN
          Stop!    Take us with you!

Harlan tries to flag down the speeding ride but sees...

The van's occupants are locked in combat with a jumper.
The beast is inside their vehicle and tearing them to
pieces. The van crashes.


EXT. POWER LINES (MAIN STREET, TOWN) - NIGHT

A group of orb weavers scurry across power lines. They
hit a transformer, shorting it out. The entire town is
suddenly plunged into darkness. Headlights. GUNFIRE.
Moonlight. Spotty illumination for the arachnids'
feeding frenzy.

                                                          65.

EXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT

A dumpster. The lid rises slightly. Wade Hale peers out
from within. He lifts the lid higher, oblivious to the
wolf spider on top of it. The spider reaches down at
him.

                            WADE
          No!     Please!

The spider is suddenly BLOWN AWAY by Sam and Chris.      Wade
climbs out of the dumpster.

                            WADE
          Thank you!

Chris and Sam move on with the kids. Wade runs after
them. Mike looks at garbage-covered Wade.

                            MIKE
          You stink.

                        WADE
                 (to Ashley)
          Have you seen Bret?

                        ASHLEY
          He was out at the dunes.

                          SAM
          Go ahead.    I've got your butt.

                            CHRIS
          What?

                          SAM
          Your back!    I've got your back!

Chris gives Sam a funny look.       Maybe Gladys was right...


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Sam leads her group down toward the mall. Other groups
of survivors do likewise. As they get closer to the mall
the groups coalesce into one large pack. We recognize
Deputy Pete. Fireman Travis. The roller-skating
waitress. Floyd. Leroy. Hank. Emma. And many other
locals.


EXT. DESERT (NEAR MALL) - NIGHT

Sam and Chris are at the front of the mob with their
kids.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly a trapdoor spider pops out of the ground. It
grabs Travis the fire chief, and pulls him under, quickly
replacing the roof of its den. TRAVIS SCREAMS
underground.

                             MIKE
             Trapdoors!    They're all around us!

                           SAM
             How can we spot them?

Mike consults his Cassiopeia.

                           MIKE
             I didn't download that part!

                             ASHLEY
             You dork!

The group wheels at the MUFFLED SOUNDS. They see
nothing. They hear another MUFFLED SCREAM, and the top
of the spider's den pops up. Travis drags himself out of
it.

                           TRAVIS
             Help... me... please...

He is dragged back underground.

The group continues toward the mall entrance. Suddenly a
gun-toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. He goes
cyclic, madly FIRING his GUN into the air as he's dragged
under.

More beasts rise out of their dens.       Reaching for the
humans.

                             CHRIS
             Keep going!

Chris and the others flee toward the mall.          Some of them
SHOOT at the spiders as they run.

Leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. Floyd tries to help but
the spider plunges its fangs into poor Leroy, dragging
him under.

The group clears the trapdoor minefield. But some of the
spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after
them.

                                                       67.

EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Sam and the kids lead just fifteen other
survivors to the glass doors. The doors are locked.
Wade pulls out a ring of fifty keys and fumbles with them
desperately.

                        ASHLEY
          There's someone inside!

The group sees Norman the dope dealer janitor approaching
out of the gloom. He's staring at them all curiously.

                          NORMAN
          We're closed.

Sam points her gun at him.   Norman raise his hands in
shock.

                        NORMAN
          Wait! I have a prescription!
          It's for my glaucoma!

                        SAM
          Open this goddamn door!

                          NORMAN
          Yes, ma'am.

Norman unlocks the door and lets the group in.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

The survivors hustle inside. They lock the glass doors
behind them. The spiders are still coming.

                        MIKE
          Get away from the doors!

                        NORMAN
          Be cool, little dude.     They're
          locked.

                        MIKE
          Glass won't stop them!

The spiders begin smashing through the glass doors.
Chris and Sam SHOOT to keep them back. People flee into
the mall.

                          SAM
          The gates!    Close the gates!

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        68.

CONTINUED:

Wade and Norman proceed to lower the slotted steel
security gates. Only problem is: Sam and Chris are on
the other side.

                           ASHLEY
             Mom!

                           MIKE
             Hurry up!

Sam and Chris see the gate coming down. They run for it
and slide underneath just as the gate comes down. A
massive trapdoor slams up against the metal. But the
metal holds.

                           SAM
             Shut the other entrances!

Norman and Chris run toward the opposite end of the mall.


INT. MALL - SOUTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Chris and Norman arrive. Spiders are SMASHING through
the GLASS. Chris and Norman bring the gate down. They
back away as more spiders slam against the steel.

                           NORMAN
             Trick or treat.

Chris and Norman head back to join the others.   They
find...


INT. HOME AND GARDEN STORE (MALL) - NIGHT

The survivors gather makeshift weapons. Floyd take a
chainsaw off the wall. Norman practices swinging a heavy
sledgehammer, accidentally toppling a stack of paint
cans. Hank stands before a display of circular buzz
saws.

Chris goes to where Sam doles out the few firearms.

                           CHRIS
             We're sealed up at both ends.

Sam hands Chris a shotgun.    He tries to get the feel of
it.

                           SAM
             You pump the slide to jack in a
             fresh round. Point at your target
             and squeeze.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.

CONTINUED:

Chris tries it out, pumping the slide. A shell flies out
the slide of the weapon and hits Wade in the head.

                           WADE
             Watch it!

                           CHRIS
             Like that?

Sam shakes her head and takes the gun back.       She pulls a
machete off the wall and hands it to Chris.

                           SAM
             Try not to cut yourself.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

The place has the feeling of a fortress under a siege.
Separate groups of townspeople are stationed at the
entrances to watch the spiders' every move.


INT. MALL - NORTH ENTRANCE - NIGHT

                           WADE
             Why didn't we see them earlier?

                           MIKE
             For the last time! They can't
             handle the sunlight. They were
             waiting in the mines for the sun
             to go down!

                           CHRIS
             Then at daybreak they'll go back
             inside. We can walk out the front
             door.

                           MIKE
             We won't make it that long.

                           ASHLEY
             They're gonna come in after us?

                           MIKE
             They're growing very fast. They
             need food to sustain that kind of
             development.

                           HANK
             Someone should go out and get
             help.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

             You go, Sam.

                             SAM
             Me?

                           WADE
             You're the sheriff.

                           SAM
             I don't have that many handcuffs.

                           PETE
             What about the police radio?

                           SAM
             You're not goin' back out there,
             Pete. None of us are.

                           CHRIS
             Radio Shack is full of cell
             phones.

                           WADE
             But the signal won't get out of
             the valley. That's why we
             couldn't sell any of the damn
             things.

                             HARLAN
             My antenna...

The group looks up. The moon-cast shadow of the antenna
is visible on the skylights that run the length of the
mall.

                           HARLAN
             I could climb up to the top. I
             bet I could get a signal out.

                             WADE
             Great idea.    You should do that.

                           CHRIS
             I'll cover you, Harlan.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan toward an access door. Sam
stands with her kids. Watching. Chris looks over his
shoulder for one last look. Sam runs up to him, gives
him the shotgun.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                           SAM
             Are you sure you can handle this?

                           CHRIS
                    (re: pants)
             While I'm gone, do you think you
             could find me a size 32?

                           SAM
             I'll do my best.
                    (a beat)
             Uhh... Do you want to go out
             sometime?  Dinner? Maybe a movie?

Chris takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her
lips.

Wade holds open the nearby access door.

                           WADE
             Hey, loverboy... you've got a town
             to save.

Chris and Harlan head out. Sam watches them disappear
through the door and then returns to the survivors.

                           ASHLEY
             You're not really going to get him
             bigger pants are you?

                           SAM
             No way.


INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Wade leads Chris and Harlan up a tight staircase. The
door at the top is identified as "Roof Access." Wade
reaches the door. The others bunch up behind him.

                           CHRIS
             Don't even think about locking
             this door.

                           WADE
             I'll be right here waiting.

Wade slowly opens the roof door.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris and Harlan step onto the roof with their gear.       No
sign of any spiders.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          72.

CONTINUED:

Wade closes the door behind them and locks it.       Chris and
Harlan aren't happy to hear that LOCK TURN.

They sneak across the roof toward the base of the
antenna.

                           CHRIS
             It looks clear.

Harlan starts climbing. Chris stands guard at the
bottom. Neither of them sees the horde of spiders
climbing up the side of the building toward the roof.


INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - MALL - NIGHT

Mike collects perfume. Packing it into his pockets like
grenades. Ashley is nearby, checking out the lingerie.

                           ASHLEY
             I didn't know you wore cologne.

                            MIKE
             I don't.   It's spider repellent.

Sam steps in through the door.

                           SAM
             Let's stay together, guys.

                           ASHLEY
                    (holds up a teddy)
             Can I get this?

                            SAM
             Move it!

The kids run out to join their mom.       After they go...

The grill of an air vent is pushed open. A huge spitting
spider pushes its way through. Dropping to the floor.
Another spider follows.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is high up on the antenna. He has a cell phone in
hand. It still indicates: "NO SERVICE." He keeps
climbing.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris sees spiders flood onto the roof.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           73.

CONTINUED:

                           CHRIS
             We've got company!

He tries to COCK the SHOTGUN.        Ejecting a shell out the
side.

                           CHRIS
             This always looks so easy on TV!

Chris gets it figured out just in time to BLAST an
attacking spider. He fades back toward the antenna.
SHOOTING.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan checks the phone.

                           HARLAN
             I've got a signal!

He dials 911.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - NIGHT

Chris is surrounded by spiders.        He starts climbing up
the antenna.

                           CHRIS
             They're coming!


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is on the phone.       He hears...

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
             911 Emergency.

                           HARLAN

             Nevada! We're being attacked by
             giant spiders! The entire town
             has been overrun!

Chris yells up to him.

                            CHRIS
             No!   Don't say that!

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)
             This is Emergency Services. Not
             dial-a-joke.

CLICK. The LINE GOES DEAD. Chris climbs up beside him.
He FIRES several BLASTS at the approaching spiders.

                              CHRIS
             What happened?

                           HARLAN
             They didn't believe me!

                              CHRIS
             What a shock!     Try again!

The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials.

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
             911 Emergency.

             There was a massive explosion!
             Everybody's dead!

                           OPERATOR (V.O.)
             Sir, your number has been flagged
             as a source of a crank call. I'm
             afraid I must terminate this
             conversation.

CLICK.

                           HARLAN
             She hung up on me!

                              CHRIS
             Climb!

Chris FIRES the SHOTGUN.       The spiders are closing in.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam gazes up at the skylight. She can see the silhouette
of Chris and Harlan climbing the antenna. Pursued by
spiders.

                              SAM
                    (sotto)
             Oh my God...

Ashley screams in horror nearby.

                           ASHLEY
             They're inside!

Sam whirls to see Ashley pointing at several spiders
coming out of Victoria's Secret. Sam runs over to fight
them.

                             WADE
             Over here!

He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home
and Garden store.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS
DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching
arac.

A spider fires a web at Harlan.       Nails the poor guy.   And
drags him off the antenna.

Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.

                             CHRIS
             I've got you!

Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris.       They're both about
to be killed unless...

                           HARLAN
             Defend the human race!

                             CHRIS
             No!

Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down
into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the
beasts along with himself.

Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and
begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna
upright.

The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna
shakes.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Deputy Pete is standing with Sam and the kids when he's
jerked off his feet and hauled into the maw of an
arachnid.

                               SAM
             Ashley!   Mike!

She sees Mike and Ashley avoid an arac by taking refuge
inside the tunnels of the jungle gym.

Sam FIRES the GUNS like Annie Oakley, putting spiders
down left and right, trying to reach her kids.

Floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain-saw.

                           FLOYD
             Having a bad hair day?!

The spider charges.     Floyd slices its legs off.

                           FLOYD
             How about a little off the top!

He slices another arac.


EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT

Chris dodges a spider's webline.       Several more come at
him.

                           CHRIS
             You're going down!

Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.
The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops
toward the glass.


INT. MALL - NIGHT

Sam looks up to   see Chris come crashing down through the
skylight on the   antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty
degree angle.    Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride
their weblines   down to the floor of the mall.

Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the
stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!

                               MIKE
             Arac attack!

Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides
down it like a pole, squashing the orb weaver at the
bottom. Sam runs to his side.

                           CHRIS
             We're on our own!

Sam tosses him a gun and they head toward the jungle gym.

The waitress roller-skates away from the spiders. She
slaloms clear of several spitters. But gets tackled by a
jumper.


INT. MALL - JUNGLE GYM

Ashley and Mike are hiding.

                           ASHLEY
             I can't stay in here!

Ashley starts to move out   of the tube. She discovers the
end has been covered with   web. She pushes it. Something
on the other side pushes   back. Ashley scrambles back.
Mike is already moving.    The kids flee through the tubes
to get away.

                           ASHLEY
             What are they doing?

                           MIKE
                    (checks Cassiopeia)
             They're trapping us like ants in a
             log! Once they have all the exits
             blocked, they'll come in through
             the last one!

They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume
grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.

Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.

                           MIKE
             We've gotta go!

Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.

                           ASHLEY
             Here!

She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But
it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the
arachnid clear.

                                                       78.

INT. MALL - NIGHT

Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam
finish off the spider and then run with the kids.

Emma runs parallel to them across the playground's
sandbox. Only to be yanked under by a trapdoor spider.

Hank sees this and goes after the spiders with all his
tools. Getting revenge with a nail gun in each hand.

                        HANK
          It's tool time!

Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry
spider descends on him from above and knocks him to the
floor.

Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s.    He
stops for a moment to look at the jeans.

                        SAM (O.S.)
          Chris!

Chris continues on.

All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and
prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all
directions.

Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.
Others use their make-shift weapons.

Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it.    Mike sees this
and gets an idea.

                        MIKE
          Where do you grow your weed?!

                        NORMAN
          Dude, if I tell you, I have to
          kill you.

Norman takes a hit on his reefer.

                        MIKE
          They're going to kill us, you
          stoner!

Norman sees the army of spiders closing in.

CONTINUED:

Norman opens    an access door. Sam and the other survivors
run over and    crowd through it. Norman shuts the door
behind them.     The groups of pursuing spiders collide and
begin ripping    each other to pieces in a feeding frenzy.


INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway.

                           WADE
             Where are you taking us?

                              NORMAN
             To Shangri-la.


INT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT

Norman leads the survivors into a basement room full of
pot paraphernalia. Hookahs. Weed growing in hydroponic
units under battery powered lights. Psychedelic posters.

                           NORMAN
             You aren't going to arrest me for
             this are you?

                              SAM
             Not today.

The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.

                           WADE
                    (to Norman)
             Oh great! Now you've trapped us!

Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.

                           CHRIS
             We should be able to hold them off
             for a little while.

Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.

                           ASHLEY
             They're coming through the wall!

The group tightens up. Back to back. Ready for the end.
Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall.

                              CHRIS
             What the hell?

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                      80.

CONTINUED:

Bret Hale rips through the drywall. Filthy but alive.
Standing in a horizontal mine shaft. He sees Sam's gun
pointed right at him.

                           BRET
             I didn't touch her!     I swear!

Sam looks at Ashley.

                           ASHLEY
             Don't waste your bullets.

Wade embraces his son.

                           WADE
             I thought you were a goner, boy!

Chris steps to the opening for a closer look at the mine.

                           CHRIS
             We can get out this way!

                           ASHLEY
             Aren't the spiders in there?

                           MIKE
             Not until daylight.

The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.

Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out to
the group.

Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.
The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.

                           BRET
             You're going back in there?!       Are
             you all crazy!?

                              WADE
             Come on, Bret!

                            BRET
             No way!   I'm not going!

Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
opening.

                                                     81.

INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.

                           CHRIS
          Cover me!

                        SAM
          What are you going to do?!

Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.

                           SAM
          Hurry!

Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
spiders.

Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...

                        SAM
          Hold that thought.

They manage to disengage and move on.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
remaining survivors.

                        WADE
          We're trapped again!

                        CHRIS
          At least they can't follow us.

                        SAM
          Which way do we go?

                        CHRIS
          I think we're in one of the old
          tunnels.

                        SAM
          Can you get us out of here?

                        CHRIS
          Don't worry, Sam.

Chris takes point with the others following nervously.

                                                       82.

INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT

A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
into a slightly more open area with two branching
tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
barrels of toxic waste.

                        CHRIS
          I don't believe it...

Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
barrel in the drainage ditch.

                        MIKE
          I've seen one of these before!

                           ASHLEY
          What are they?

                           CHRIS
          Toxic waste.

                        SAM
          Where did you see it, Mike?

                        MIKE
          The creek where Joshua gets his
          spider food. There was one in the
          water.

Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.

                        CHRIS
          We can get out this way!

                        BRET
          No, we can't.
                 (turns to Wade)
          Isn't that tunnel blocked off,
          Dad?

Chris and the others look at Wade.

                        WADE
          Uh... yeah... he's right.   We
          can't get out that way.

                           CHRIS
          You did this?

                        WADE
          I knew you'd never sell... We're
          under my property so...

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          83.

CONTINUED:

                           SAM
             You put all of us at risk.

                           WADE
             I didn't have a choice! I was
             broke! They gave me a hundred
             grand!

Sam punches him.     Knocking Wade to the ground.

                           SAM
             I think our lives are worth a
             little more than that.

                           CHRIS
             We're wasting time.

Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
them.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
runs along the roof into both tunnels.

                           CHRIS
             One end of these lights should be
             connected to a generator. That'll
             be near the entrance.

They continue down the tunnel.     Entering...


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.

                           WADE
             My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't
             lying! That's what I can put on
             the insurance form... giant
             spiders!

                           ASHLEY
             Ewww... what's that smell?

The others are reacting strongly.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          84.

CONTINUED:

                            CHRIS
             Methane.   This cavern is full of
             gas.

                           ASHLEY
             What does that mean?

                           CHRIS
             One spark and we're all dead.

Norman swallows his glowing joint.

Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.

                           MIKE
             That's what I was talking about,
             Chris. Presents from the male
             tarantula to the female.

                           BRET
             So the female's around here?

Bret looks around nervously.

The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
drained away.

Mike hides his eyes.     Ashley comforts him.

                           SAM
             That one just moved!

Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete.       The
web comes away to reveal a human hand.

                           CHRIS
             There's somebody in here!

Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
They finally reveal Gladys.

                            CHRIS
             Gladys!

The woman's body begins to spasm.

                           CHRIS
             Gladys, please...
                    (to the others)
             Can anybody help her?!

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                               85.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.

                           ASHLEY
             Her breathing is shallow.       She's
             going into arrest.

Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.

                             CHRIS
             It's okay.    It's okay.

Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.

                             GLADYS
             Am I... dead?

                             CHRIS
             You're okay.

                           GLADYS
             I'm not in heaven?

                             CHRIS
             No...

                           GLADYS
             Then what's with all the gold?

Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls.

                             WADE
             Gold! Gold!     Look!    It's
             everywhere!

                             SAM
             Is it real?

Chris checks it out.

                           CHRIS
             Jesus... it's the mother lode...
             He was right. My dad was right...

Chris helps Gladys to her feet.         They share an emotional
look of recognition.

                             GLADYS
             So were you.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          86.

CONTINUED:

Wade chips away at the gold.

                           WADE
             Get as much as you can!

Bret looks at Ashley.

                           BRET
             Nice work, Doc.

Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade.           Sam
puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.

                           SAM
             You saved my life.

Ashley smiles.

Gladys leans over to Norman.

                           GLADYS
             Have you got a smoke, kid?

                           NORMAN
             The man says this cavern is full
             of highly flammable methane gas.
             I smoke to get high, not to die.

                           SAM
             Spiders!

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows.

                           NORMAN
             What's the big deal?

Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
squashed bodies.

                           MIKE
             I think you should stop.

                           NORMAN
             Why?

                        MIKE
          They don't have hair. They aren't
          fully grown tarantulas.

Chris and Sam look over.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        87.

CONTINUED:

                           MIKE
             They're giant babies!

Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.

Chris reacts to the noise.    He can guess what's coming...

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.

Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.

                           MIKE
             Consuela.

                           CHRIS
             Consuela?

The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas.

As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.

                           NORMAN
             Bummer...

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.

                           CHRIS
             Go!

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern.        A
male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold.

                           CHRIS
             Leave it!

                           WADE
             So you can keep it all!?   Hell no!

Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          88.

CONTINUED:

                              BRET
             Dad!

Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave.

                              CHRIS
             Bret, come on!

Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.

                              ASHLEY
             Bret!

Ashley goes to his side.

                              BRET
             I'm sorry I...

Bret dies.     Sam drags Ashley away from him.


INT. MINES - NIGHT

The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling.

                           SAM
             We have to get out!

                           CHRIS
             This is our chance to kill them
             all.

Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.

                           CHRIS
             When the power comes on, the bulb
             will ignite the methane and torch
             them!

                           SAM
             Where did you get an idea like
             that!?

Chris looks at Gladys.

                           GLADYS
             I blew up the kitchen.

             Keep going up the tunnel. There
             should be a generator at the exit.
             Start it up and await for my
             signal to throw the switch.

                           SAM
             And the toxic waste...

                           CHRIS
             Will be buried under tons of rock!
             Go!

                           SAM
             What about you?

                           CHRIS
             I need to set the fuse as close to
             the spiders as I can. That should
             give us time to get clear.

Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
down the lights, dragging them back toward the
tarantula's den.

                           SAM
             He has a cute butt.    Don't you
             think?

INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse. Consuela
and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and
Wade Hale.

Chris finds a vent in the ground.       He sprinkles dust over
it to identify a faint draft.

                           CHRIS
             Bingo.

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas
jet.


INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel. Sam and Ashley are
behind. Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the
shadows, separating the groups.

                                                (CONTINUED)

             Keep going!

Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

Chris finishes preparing the booby trap. He gets up to
leave. Only to find Consuela coming toward him.

                           CHRIS
             I hate spiders.

Chris runs out of the cavern.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running.


INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula. Sam stumbles
over something on the ground. It's Bret Hale's lost
motorcycle. Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them.

                           ASHLEY
             Hurry!

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
bike's headlight illuminates their path.

The male tarantula scurries after the bike.

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.

Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite
direction.

                           ASHLEY
             Oh shit.

                                              (CONTINUED)

Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears.

                             SAM
             Banzai!

With perfect timing, she brings the front wheel down hard
onto the tarantula's back. Crunch! The spider is
roadkill. Sam steers them down another tunnel.


EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the
tunnel exit. Mike tries to start the generator. It
won't catch.

                             MIKE
             It needs gas!

                           GLADYS
             There's a ranch!

Gladys heads over toward Wade's ranch.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs along the tunnel. Consuela charges after him,
Chris reaches up, smashing more light bulbs as he runs.


EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAWN

Mike is at the generator as Sam and Ashley ride up on the
motorcycle.

                             MIKE
             It needs gas!

Sam tips over the motorcycle, trying to get gas out of
the tank. It's clear this is not going to work.

                             ASHLEY
             Hurry!


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs.     Smashing light bulbs.   Consuela close
behind.

                           CHRIS
             Start the generator!

          He's coming!

                          ASHLEY
          Hurry, Mom!

Sam has dumped some fuel into the generator.   She tries
to start it. It won't turn over.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris ducks as Consuela fires quills at him.   He keeps
going.


INT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - DAWN

Sam sees Chris at the bottom of the tunnel. She tries to
start the generator again but it refuses to cooperate.

                        CHRIS
          Throw the switch!

                        SAM
          I don't have any power!

                          ASHLEY
          Yo, Mom!

Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN. Sam catches
it and brings it down to the light bulb cable... ZAPPING
it.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

As Chris runs, the light bulbs illuminate sequentially,
traveling past him into the cavern.


INT. MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

A broken light bulb sparks. The filament ignites the
gas-filled tunnel. A ball of flame spreads throughout
the mines.


INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN

A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber. All the
gold is illuminated. Consuela's babies are burned like
popcorn.

                                                           93.

EXT. MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela
is on his heels. The glow of a fireball is right behind
them.

                          SAM
          Come on!

Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames.

                          SAM
          Chris!

Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration.


EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening. A pillar of
flame shoots out behind them.   Ashley and Mike are
nearby. The town is visible just a mile away.


EXT. TOWN - DAY

The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into
the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.


INT. VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY

The chain reaction spreads through the mines.      Jets of
flame blast up tunnels.

Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home.
Rupturing the very earth around them.


EXT. DESERT - NEAR WADE'S RANCH - DAY

The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

                          ASHLEY
          Earthquake!

                        CHRIS
          No! It's a chain reaction! The
          whole valley is going to blow!

                        MIKE
          We'll never get out in time!

Gladys drives up in     Wade's humvee.   Cigar in mouth.

                           GLADYS
             Let's get the fuck out of here!

The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
BLOW UP in the distance.

Chris is just about to climb aboard when... A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
revenge.

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her.            He
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuela's fangs.

Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
helping it!

Mike and the others watch from the humvee.

                           MIKE
             Oh no... she's molting!

Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated!

Consuela comes after Chris.        He defends himself with the
machete.

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.
Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares
the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.

                               MIKE
             Consuela!   No!     Bad!   Bad
             Consuela!

The massive spider stops in shock.            Chris looks back to
see Mike has returned.


TARANTULA POV

The familiar multi-perspective spider vision.            The
tarantula seems to recognize Mike.

                                                       95.

BACK TO MIKE

He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...

Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected
abdomen...

The tarantula screams.

Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike.   They dive
into the back of the humvee.

Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded. She
collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.
The earth itself begins to collapse.


INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY

Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.
BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth. The
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The humvee reaches open road. The survivors watch out
the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole.


EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

The group sits in a long beat of abject shock. And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped.

                        CHRIS
          I really need some pants that fit.

The group smiles.    Happy to be alive.

                          MIKE
          Look out!

Everyone looks to the road ahead. A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway. Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it.


EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety.

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment, and then is

               stands out against the planet, tiny against Neptune's scale.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL DRIFT CLOSER

               to discern the hard angles of a man-made craft. A ship. No 
               longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: 
               a vast labyrinth of steel.

               Its shadow swallows all in darkness.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Shafts of Neptune's blue light enter through windows, 
               illuminate debris suspended in the zero-gravity environment: 
               shards of metal and glass.

               MOVE from the Corridor into:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               A cockpit for three. Neptune's blue light fills the chamber, 
               reflects off immobile particles in the air. Thick quartz 
               windows look down at Neptune. The cockpit lights are dark 
               but for one blinking red light.

               An emergency beacon. Under-floor lights go on.

               The strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the 
               helm, slowly spinning. He is dead, perfectly preserved in 
               the cold vacuum of space. His eyes are empty black pits and 
               his mouth hangs open in a scream: DR. WILLIAM WEIR.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               Weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. Sweat beads his 
               ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

               He turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. 
               Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count 
               photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful 
               woman.

               Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...

               RECENT, UNFRAMED PHOTO

               The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave 
               smile.

               Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to 
               his forehead and closes his eyes. Trying to be with her, 
               just one more time.

                                     WEIR

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a 
               straight-razor. The mirror reveals the bathtub just behind 
               him. DRIP, DRIP, DRIP...

               Weir turns to stare at the bathtub. Water wells up at the 
               mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls... 
               DRIP.

               Weir turns back to his shaving.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

               Weir stands in the kitchenette, staring at the microwave as 
               it cooks his breakfast.

               Weir stands before his window, chewing his oatmeal

               INT. HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

               Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. A 
               box magnifies the eighth planet, Neptune, revealing a flashing 
               red dot in its orbit.

                         At oh-three-hundred this morning,

                         two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.

               Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the

                         back.

               Hollis answers drily.

                                     HOLLIS
                         That ship was lost in deep space, 
                         seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed 
                         into New York harbor, I'd find it 
                         more plausible.

                         Houston wants Aerospace to send out 
                         a search and rescue team, investigate 
                         the source of the transmission. If 
                         it really is the Event Horizon, 
                         they'll attempt a salvage.

                         We need you to prepare a detailed 
                         briefing on the ship's systems for 
                         the salvage crew...

                                     WEIR
                         A written briefing can't possibly 
                         anticipate the variables on a mission 
                         like this. I have to go with them.

               Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.

                                     LYLE
                         Dr. Weir, you have no experience 
                         with salvage procedures.

                                     WEIR
                         I designed the ship's propulsion 
                         system. I am the only person capable 
                         of evaluating the performance of the 
                         gravity drive. You can't send a Search 
                         and Rescue team out there alone and 
                         expect them to succeed. That would 
                         be like... like sending an auto-
                         mechanic to work on the shuttle.

                                     LYLE
                         I can understand your desire to redeem 
                         your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it 
                         doesn't factor into this.

                                     WEIR
                         This is not about my reputation! 
                         This is not about me at all!
                              (beat, passionate)
                         The Event Horizon was created for 
                         one reason: to go faster than light. 
                         Imagine mankind exploring new solar 
                         systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven 
                         years ago, we didn't just lose the 
                         ship and the crew. We lost the dream.
                              (beat, quiet and 
                              relentless)
                         I have to go.

                         It's not that simple.
                              (off of Weir's 
                              expression)
                         Lyle, play the recording for Dr. 
                         Weir.

                                     LYLE
                         Navigation Control tried to hail the 
                         vessel. This was the only response.

               Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips 
               from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES. 
               Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together, 
               they are unbearable.

               The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape.

               Weir sits there, stunned.

                                     LYLE
                         Since the initial transmission, 
                         there's been no further contact. 
                         Just the beacon, every two minutes.

                                     WEIR
                         The crew? Could they still be alive?

                                     LYLE
                         The ship had life support systems 
                         for eighteen months. They're been 
                         gone seven years.

                                     WEIR
                         Someone sent that message. Admiral, 
                         you have to put me on that ship.

               Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.

                                     HOLLIS
                         It's against my better judgement, 
                         but I'll run this by the Man 
                         downstairs. You'll know my decision 
                         by the end of the day.

                                     WEIR
                         Thank you.

                                     HOLLIS
                         Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing 
                         you any favors.

               Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.

                                     LYLE
                         You're not seriously considering 
                         sending him?

                                     HOLLIS
                         You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. 
                         The man held Oppenheimer's chair at 
                         Princeton. If the Event Horizon had 
                         worked, he would have gone down in 
                         history as the greatest mind in 
                         physics since Einstein.

                         The official inquiry blamed Weir's 
                         design for the ship's loss.

                                     HOLLIS
                         That doesn't mean a damn thing. They 
                         were looking for a scapegoat and 
                         Weir fit the bill. But he's not 
                         responsible for what happened to the 
                         ship.

                                     LYLE
                         Does he know that?

                         What's on your mind?

                                     LYLE
                         He doesn't belong on this mission. 
                         Responsible or not, he blames himself. 
                         He's too close to it.

                         It's been two years since she died. 
                         He's over it.

               Split level. Above: avionics, navigation, flight control. 
               STARCK (female, Navigator, sharp mind, sharp tongue) checks 
               the navigation data on her screen as SMITH (male, Pilot, 
               wrapped too tight) punches in the course.

                         I can't believe this, I haven't gotten 
                         more than my hand in six weeks and 
                         now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap,

                         Smith's right. Neptune? There's 
                         nothing out there. If something 
                         happens, we'll be on our own.

               The captain's chair drops from above, swivels to reveal MILLER

               Miller slides down a ladder into the war-room. The others 
               follow into...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Bulky EVA (extra-vehicular activity) suits line the walls. 
               MUSIC blares from a JAMBOX, built into a storage locker.

               An Emergency Tech stows safety lines: COOPER -- male, the 
               resident pain-in-the-ass. He SINGS along with the music.

               PETERS (female, Emergency Technician, the crew's denmother) 
               and DJ (male, Doctor, a cold perfectionist) load CO2 scrubbers 
               into a bin in the floor.

               Weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel.

                         The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If 
                         you'll follow the rest of the crew, 
                         they'll show you to the gravity tanks.

               Weir hesitates, then follows the crew into Medical. Miller 
               hangs back.

                                     MILLER
                         What's the hold up?

                         No, no, its alright. I talked to my 
                         ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas

                         I am sorry. But now we have to go to

               line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: 
               gravity couches.

               The crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no 
               room for modesty.

               Starck catches Cooper looking at her ass as she strips to 
               her undergarments. Cooper grins. She flips him off, not 
               bothering to turn around.

                                     COOPER
                         Is that an offer?

                                     STARCK
                         It is not.

               Miller disrobes. Two service tags hang around his neck. He 
               does not remove them. Weir approaches him.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain Miller, I appreciate this 
                         opportunity...

                                     MILLER
                         Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on 
                         your mission because we want to. We 
                         were pulled off a well deserved leave, 
                         to be sent out to the middle of 
                         nowhere, and no one's even told us 
                         why.

                                     WEIR
                         I've been authorized to brief you 
                         and the crew once we reach Neptune 
                         space.

                                     MILLER
                         Until then, do what you're told and 
                         stay out of my way.

               Weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written 
               on a piece of tape. Peters watches him.

                                     PETERS
                         First time in a grav couch?

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

               She checks Weir's couch, helps him climb in. Weir keeps one 
               eye on Miller.

                                     PETERS
                              (Off of Weir's glance)
                         Don't worry about it. He's hard, but 
                         he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping 
                         out with him. He's one of the few 
                         Captains in the service with 
                         experience in the Outer Reach.

                                     WEIR
                         He's been past Mars?

                                     PETERS
                         He served on the Goliath.

                                     WEIR
                         Wasn't that ship destroyed?

                                     PETERS

                         They attempted to rescue a supply 
                         shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's 
                         oh-two tanks ruptured during the 
                         rescue, flooded both ships with pure 
                         oxygen. There was a spark and both 
                         ships were incinerated. The Skipper 
                         and three others just made it to a 
                         lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...

                         He doesn't like to talk about it.

               DJ swathes one of Weir's arms with alcohol.

                         You didn't eat anything in the past 
                         twelve hours?

               Weir shakes his head.

                         When the Ion drive fires, we'll be 
                         taking about 30 gees. Without a tank, 
                         the force would liquefy your skeleton.

               DJ injects Weir. The scientist winces.

                                     WEIR

               DJ hands him the breathing mask.

                         Put this on.

               Weir does. DJ checks the fit.

                                     PETERS
                         You'll be fine. You'll wake up and 
                         we'll be there. Watch your fingers.

               DJ closes the tank. It begins to fill with green gel. Weir's 
               eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. His 
               eyes close. His body draws into a fetal position.

               dead. A distant SOUND echoes though the ship, the unholy 
               garble of human and inhuman voices -- it is the Event Horizon, 
               calling to him -- the sound refines into a WOMAN'S VOICE, no

               A naked WOMAN sits at the helm, her back to us. Completely 
               still. Her skin is very pale. Water pools around her chair. 
               Weir stands behind her.

               She does not answer. She does not move. Weir reaches out to 
               touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.

                                     WEIR
                         Claire? I'm sorry. Claire?

               He reaches out again. He touches her hair. She doesn't move. 
               Weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors. 
               Something wrong with her face... He starts to spin her around.

               Weir awakes with a jolt, in his grav couch. His mask has 
               slipped. His tank has filled with blood. He is drowning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Reality. Weir's eyes open. He presses against the glass of 
               the tank, trying to force it open, panicked. The others are 
               already stepping from open tanks.

               Weir's tank opens with a HISS. He tumbles to the floor, 
               gasping, fluid streaming from his mouth.

               Peters rushes to him.

                         It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.

               Weir catches his breath. He looks up. The crew surrounds 
               him, concerned.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm alright now. I'm alright...

                         experience a little disorientation.

               Weir nods.

                                     COOPER
                         Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like

                         No, thank you.

               Cooper, still butt-naked and proud of it, grabs a metal 
               cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself.

                                     COOPER
                         Hey, Starck. You wanna dry my back?

               Starck gives him a cool once over.

                         lifesaver and a heartbreaker...

                                     MILLER
                         He's a rescue technician. Peters, 
                         medical technician. DJ...

                                     DJ
                         Trauma.

                                     MILLER
                         And this is mission specialist Dr. 
                         William Weir. We all know where we're 
                         going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us 
                         why.

               Miller and the crew look at Weir, waiting. Weir clears his 
               throat.

                                     WEIR
                         What I am about to tell you is 
                         considered code-black by the NSA.

               The crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a 
               mission briefing before.

                                     JUSTIN
                         That means top-secret, Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         I heard it.

                                     WEIR
                         The USAC intercepted a radio 
                         transmission from a decaying orbit 
                         around Neptune. The source has been 
                         identified as the Event Horizon.

               STUNNED SILENCE. Then everyone talks at once:

                                     STARCK
                         That's impossible! She was lost with 
                         all hands, what, seven...

                                     JUSTIN
                         Seven years ago, the reactor blew...

                                     PETERS
                         How can we salvage...?

                                     SMITH
                         Let the dead rest, man...

                                     COOPER
                         ...cancel our leave and send us out 
                         on some bullshit mission...!

                                     MILLER
                         EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.

               In the quiet that follows:

                                     WEIR
                         What was made public about the Event 
                         Horizon, that she was a deep space 
                         research vessel, that its reactor 
                         went critical, that the ship blew 
                         up... None of that is true.
                              (beat)
                         The Event Horizon was the culmination 
                         of a secret government project to 
                         create a spacecraft capable of faster-
                         than-light flight.

               The crew stares at Weir: he has just dropped another bomb on 
               them.

                                     SMITH
                         You can't do that.

                                     STARCK
                         The law of relativity prohibits faster-
                         than-light travel...

                                     WEIR
                         Relativity, yes. We can't break the 
                         law of relativity, but we can go 
                         around it. The ship doesn't really 
                         move faster than the speed of light; 
                         it creates a dimensional gateway 
                         that allows the ship to 
                         instantaneously "jump" from one point 
                         in the universe to another, light 
                         years away.

                                     STARCK
                         How?

                                     WEIR
                         Well, in layman's terms, you use a 
                         rotating magnetic field to focus a 
                         narrow beam of gravitons; these in 
                         turn fold space-time consistent with 
                         Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-
                         time curvature becomes infinitely 
                         large and you have a singularity...

                                     COOPER
                         Laymen's terms.

               Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up 
               from Smith's locker.

                                     SMITH
                         Hey...

                                     WEIR
                         Say this paper represents space-time, 
                         and you want to get from "point A" 
                         here...
                              (marks it on the photo 
                              with a pen)
                         ...to "point B," here.
                              (marks point B)
                         Now: what's the shortest distance 
                         between two points?

               The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.

                                     STARCK
                         A straight line.

                                     WEIR
                         Wrong. The shortest distance between 
                         two points...

               Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then 
               THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.

                                     WEIR
                         ...is zero. That's what the 
                         singularity does: it folds space, so 
                         that point A and point B coexist in 
                         the same space and time. After the 
                         ship passes through this gateway, 
                         space returns to normal.
                              (hands the ruined pin-
                              up back to Smith)
                         It's called a gravity drive.

                                     JUSTIN
                         How do you know all this?

                                     WEIR
                         I built it.

               Even Cooper is impressed.

                                     COOPER
                         I can see why they sent you along.

                                     JUSTIN
                         So if the ship didn't blow up, what 
                         happened?

                                     WEIR
                         It was the ship's maiden voyage, to 
                         test the drive. The Event Horizon 
                         moved to safe distance using ion 
                         thrusters. They received the go-ahead 
                         to activate the gravity drive.
                              (beat)
                         And the ship vanished from all our 
                         scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced 
                         optical, no radio contact of any 
                         kind. They disappeared without a 
                         trace.
                              (beat)
                         Until now.

                                     MILLER
                         Where has it been for the last seven 
                         years?

                                     WEIR
                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. INTERPLANETARY SPACE - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark flashes silently past, heading deeper 
               and deeper into space.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The crew assembled.

                                     WEIR
                         We haven't been able to confirm any 
                         live contact, but TDRSS did receive 
                         a single transmission from the Event 
                         Horizon.

               Weir punches a button on a console. The transmission BLARES 
               from the bridge's speakers, STATIC and NOISE and, underneath 
               all, INHUMAN VOICES.

               The crew listen, look at one another. The recording ends 
               abruptly.

                                     SMITH
                         What the hell is that?

                                     PETERS
                         It doesn't sound like anything human.

                                     WEIR
                         Houston has passed the recording 
                         through several filters and isolated 
                         what appears to be a human voice.

               He activates a different file. The resulting WAIL is more 
               human but no less terrifying, a cry of despair. The last 
               message from a drowning man...

                                     SMITH
                         Jesus...

                                     MILLER
                         What is that?

                                     DJ
                         It sounds like Latin.

                                     COOPER
                         Latin? Who the fuck speaks Latin?

                                     STARCK
                         No one. It's a dead language.

                                     DJ
                         Mostly dead.

                                     MILLER
                         What does it say?

                                     WEIR
                         NSA encryption specialists have 
                         deciphered some of the message...

               Weir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time.

                                     WEIR
                         There: "...liberatis me..." They 
                         haven't been able to translate the 
                         rest, it's too distorted.

                                     DJ
                         "Liberatis me." "Save me."

                                     COOPER
                         From what?

                                     MILLER
                              (to Weir)
                         You're convinced the crew could still 
                         be alive? After seven years?

                                     WEIR
                         The Event Horizon only had life 
                         support for eighteen months. It seems 
                         impossible, but in light of the 
                         transmission... I have to think that 
                         someone has managed to endure until 
                         now.

                                     COOPER
                         Skipper, do we get hazard pay for 
                         this?

                                     MILLER
                         You heard the tape, Smith. We're 
                         looking for survivors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The flight crew assembled. Data flashes across the main 
               monitors on the bridge.

               The ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere, a growing 
               vibration.

               GRAPHICS flash across the main window's HUD. Neptune's dark 
               shadow fills the screen.

                                     SMITH
                         We have a lock on the Event Horizon's 
                         navigation beacon. It's in the upper 
                         ionosphere, we're in for some chop.

                                     MILLER
                         Bring us in tight. Starck, get on 
                         the horn, see if anyone's listening...

                                     STARCK
                              (into radio)
                         This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel 
                         Lewis and Clark, hailing Event 
                         Horizon, Event Horizon, do you 
                         read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, 
                         hailing...
                              (she continues B.G.)

                                     SMITH
                              (over Starck)
                         Matching speed... now. Range to target 
                         ten thousand meters and closing... 
                         Skipper, I got a bad feeling about 
                         this...

                                     MILLER
                         We're all on edge, Smith. We're a 
                         long way out...

                                     SMITH
                         That's not it. That ship was built 
                         to go faster than light... That's 
                         just wrong, it goes against everything 
                         we know...

                                     MILLER
                         What are you trying to say? "If God 
                         had intended Man to fly, he would 
                         have given us wings?"

                                     SMITH
                         Something like that, yeah.

               Miller grins grimly.

                                     MILLER
                         I guess we're about to find out. 
                         Keep us slow and steady.

                                     SMITH
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir...!

               Weir sticks his head into the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         I think you want to see this.

               Weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck.

                                     WEIR
                         Where is she?

                                     SMITH
                         Dead ahead, 5000 meters.

               Suddenly, the ship SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY.

               Weir braces himself in the doorway, staring out the forward 
               window into the roiling azure clouds.

               Smith grimaces, his knuckles white at the controls.

                                     SMITH
                         We've got some weather.

                                     MILLER
                         I noticed. Starck, anybody home?

                                     STARCK
                         If they are, they're screening their 
                         calls.

                                     SMITH
                         Range 3000 meters and closing.

                                     WEIR
                         I can't see anything...

               Only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the Lewis and 
               Clark's windows.

                                     SMITH
                         1500 meters. We're getting too 
                         close...

                                     MILLER
                         Where is it?

                                     STARCK
                              (checking her console)
                         The scope is lit, it's right in front 
                         of us...

                                     SMITH
                         1000 meters...

               A red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill 
               BEEP.

                                     SMITH
                         Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 
                         700... we're right on top of it, 
                         we're gonna hit!

                                     MILLER
                         Starck...

                                     STARCK
                         It should be right there...

               She looks up, trails off...

                                     STARCK
                         My God.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AGAINST NEPTUNE - MODEL STARCK'S POV

               ...the clouds break, revealing...

               THE EVENT HORIZON, right in front of them. A black 
               labyrinthine blasphemy against Neptune's arctic blue. Cloud 
               banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARKE - BRIDGE

                                     MILLER
                         Reverse thrusters full!

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - DWARFED BY EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Event Horizon looms enormous as the Lewis and Clark hangs 
               off the port stern, dwarfed by the giant ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The turbulence subsides. The bridge crew stares at the massive 
               craft. The only sound, the PROXIMITY WARNING. Finally:

                                     SMITH
                         Jesus, that is one big ugly fat 
                         fucker...

                                     WEIR
                         She's not ugly.

               Miller reaches over Smith's shoulder, turns off the proximity 
               warning. Smith snaps back to business.

                                     SMITH
                         Range 500 meters and holding. 
                         Turbulence is dropping off...

                                     STARCK
                         Picking up magnetic interference.

                                     MILLER
                         Put it through TACS. Smith, you up 
                         for a flyby?

                                     SMITH
                              (he is not)
                         Love to.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark maneuvers in close to the Event Horizon, 
               dwarfed by the dark ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Smith keeps a tight hand on the controls. The crew stare out 
               the viewport at the abandoned craft.

                                     STARCK
                         Look at the size of that thing.

               Weir explains the view out the cockpit window.

                                     WEIR
                         Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, 
                         medical and science labs, hydroponics, 
                         what have you. That central section 
                         connects the forward decks to the 
                         Engineering containment area. Can we 
                         move in closer?

                                     SMITH
                         Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna 
                         need a rubber...

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

               Smith grimaces. His hands move carefully over the controls.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark moves even closer. Vanishing into the 
               shadow of the Event Horizon.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               The crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport. A 
               huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead.

                                     WEIR
                         That's the engineering containment. 
                         And there's the main airlock. We can 
                         dock there.

                                     MILLER
                         Smith, use the arm and lock us onto 
                         that antennae cluster.

                                     WEIR
                         Be careful. It's not a load bearing 
                         structure...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               The Lewis and Clark carefully maneuvers in close to the Event 
               Horizon's airlock.

               A mechanical boom-arm extends from the smaller ship to latch 
               onto the Event Horizon. Its clawed hand grabs the antennae 
               cluster. The cluster buckles under the stress.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     SMITH
                              (to Weir)
                         It is now.
                              (to Miller)
                         We're locked in.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, give me a read.

               A scan of the Event Horizon appears across Starck's screen.

                                     STARCK
                         The reactor's still hot. We've got 
                         several small radiation sources, 
                         leaks probably. Nothing serious.

                                     WEIR
                         Do they have pressure?

                                     STARCK
                         Affirmative. The hull's intact... 
                         but there's no gravity and the thermal 
                         units are off line. I'm showing deep 
                         cold. The crew couldn't survive unless 
                         they were in stasis.

                                     MILLER
                         Find 'em, Starck.

               Starck frowns at her display.

                                     STARCK
                         Something's wrong with the bio-scan.

                                     MILLER
                         Radiation interference?

                                     STARCK
                         There's not enough radiation to throw 
                         off the scan. I'm picking up trace 
                         life forms, but I can't get a lock 
                         on the location.

                                     WEIR
                         Could it be the crew? If they were 
                         in suspended animation, wouldn't 
                         that effect the scan?

                                     STARCK
                         If they were in stasis, I'd get a 
                         location, but these readings, they're 
                         all over the ship. It doesn't make 
                         any sense.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by 
                         deck, room by room. Starck, deploy 
                         the umbilicus. I believe you're up 
                         for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your 
                         bonnet on.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Yes, sir!

               Weir starts to follow Justin from the bridge.

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.

                                     WEIR
                         Captain, I didn't come out here to 
                         sit on your bridge, I need to be on 
                         that ship...

                                     MILLER
                         Once the ship is secured, we'll bring 
                         you on board --

                                     WEIR
                              (interrupting)
                         That is not acceptable --

                                     MILLER
                              (overlapping)
                         -- once we've secured the ship, that's 
                         the way it is!
                              (beat)
                         I need you to guide us from the comm 
                         station. This is where I need you. 
                         Help us to do our job.

               Weir exhales.

                                     WEIR
                         Very well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               The docking collar umbilicus extends to the Event Horizon's 
               airlock.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Miller, Peters, Justin and Cooper in EVA; Cooper and Justin, 
               without headgear.

                                     COOPER
                         ...come on, Skipper, I already put 
                         my shoes on...

                                     MILLER
                              (muffled)
                         You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's 
                         Justin's turn. Stay on station. If 
                         anything happens...

                                     COOPER
                         I'll be all over it.

               Miller nods to Peters.

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         Opening inner airlock door.

               The inner airlock door opens: CH-THUNK. Miller, Peters and 
               Justin enter the airlock. Justin attaches his safety line. 
               Miller and Peters do not.

                                     COOPER
                         You still need the rope? I thought 
                         you were one a those spacemen with 
                         ice in ya veins.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I'd rather be on the rope and not 
                         need it than need it and not have 
                         it. Now step aside, old man.

               Cooper puts Justin's helmet on. It seals tight.

                                     COOPER
                              (serious now)
                         You just keep your nose clean, Baby 
                         Bear. Clear the door.

               Cooper backs out, allowing the inner airlock door to shut, 
               ECHOING through the ship.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

               Miller, Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit 
               umbilicus into the Event Horizon, all in EVA suits. Justin's 
               safety line trails out behind him.

               The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir has taken over Justin's station. He watches the POV 
               monitors like a kid watching Christmas. Smith and Starck 
               keep tabs over his shoulder.

                                     WEIR
                         You've reached the outer airlock 
                         door.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

               Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to 
               measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door.

                                     PETERS
                         We've got pressure.

                                     MILLER
                         Clear and open on my mark. Three... 
                         two... one... mark.

               Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door. 
               The door slowly opens...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both 
               directions. Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools 
               of blue light amidst endless black, adding to the vast sense 
               of scale.

               The light from their dual spotlights on the team's helmets 
               reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere. They 
               are ants in a tomb built for giants.

                                     PETERS
                         Jesus its huge.

                                     MILLER
                         Ice crystals everywhere. This place 
                         is a deep freeze.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         You're in the central corridor. It 
                         connects the personnel areas to 
                         Engineering.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters and I will search the forward 
                         decks. Justin, take Engineering. No 
                         hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?

                                     JUSTIN
                         Not a chance, sir.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               The group separates. Justin kicks off from the wall, shoots 
               down the corridor at immense speed.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction. They use 
               magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the 
               walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft. 
               Their journey seems endless. The darkness almost seems a 
               living thing as it surrounds them.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller spots something at a coupling, where two sections of 
               the corridor join...

                                     MILLER
                         Dr. Weir, what's this?

               Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling. The 
               universal symbol for explosives is on the cover.

                                     PETERS
                              (ahead at the next 
                              coupling)
                         Here's another one. They're all over 
                         the place.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         They're explosive charges.

                                     MILLER
                         I can see that, what're they for?

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     WEIR
                         In an emergency, the charges detonate 
                         in series, destroying the central 
                         section and separating the personnel 
                         areas from the rest of the ship. 
                         That way, if the gravity drive 
                         malfunctions, the crew could use the 
                         foredecks as a lifeboat.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Peters and Miller keep moving.

                                     PETERS
                         That means they didn't abandon ship.

                                     MILLER
                         So where are they? Starck, any luck 
                         with the bio-scan?

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

                                     STARCK
                         I'm running diagnostics now, 
                         Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the 
                         sensor pack, I'm still getting trace 
                         life readings, all over the ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Peters unconsciously look around. Sweat beads 
               their faces.

                                     PETERS
                         There's no one in the corridor but 
                         us.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Not according to the computer.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters is right, no one's here.

                                     PETERS
                         I don't know, this place is really 
                         dark, I can't see a thing...

               She starts to wave her searchlight around wildly.

                                     MILLER
                              (calming her down)
                         Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. 
                         Let's finish the sweep.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         Captain Miller, the foredecks are 
                         just ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         I can see the hatch.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, you still showing those 
                         readings?

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         That's an affirmative.

                                     MILLER
                              (to Peters)
                         Keep your eyes open.

               She nods as he reaches for the hatch...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               The hatch opens, allowing Peters and Miller entrance into 
               the forward decks. These areas were intended for human 
               habitation, and seem similar in design to the Lewis and Clark, 
               only larger.

               Gravity couches line both walls, eighteen in all. Empty.

                                     PETERS
                         We found the gravity couches.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir peers eagerly at the monitors.

                         Any survivors?

                         They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving 
                         forward.

               Miller and Peters split up, each taking a separate exit from 
               the chamber.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Weir looks at Justin's POV screen: a grainy image of the 
               First Containment Seal.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (BY FIRST SEAL)

               Justin stands before a thick pressure door. Justin checks 
               the door with his thumper, his boots are now on.

                         Seal. The engineering decks are on 
                         the other side.

                                     JUSTIN
                         We still have pressure. The radiation 
                         count's steady at 7 millirads an

               Justin touches a panel beside the door. It opens. He enters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               ...a long corridor shaped like a tube. It rotates like a 
               turbine, causing vertigo. Justin's BREATH echoes in his helmet 
               as he moves forward...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Cooper stares at Justin's safety line in the airlock.

               THE SAFETY LINE

               counts off silently, passing 150 meters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               The corridor ends at a pressure door.

                                     PETERS
                         Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?

                         You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. 
                         You still haven't seen any crew?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Miller, moving through a deserted lab. Empty operating tables. 
               Stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero-G. A glove 
               floats up behind him, brushes his shoulder. He wheels... the 
               glove is empty. It spins away.

                                     MILLER
                         If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd 
                         know about it.

                         looks like this place has never been

               Peters enters. Looks around: a small antechamber for crew 
               briefings, with chairs and a display table. Red crystals 
               float in a crimson mist around her.

                                     PETERS

               Weir peers at the monitors, trying to make out the red haze.

                         Yes, we can see some kind of mist. 
                         What is that?

                         Blood. Looks like arterial spray.

                         The blood came from somewhere, 
                         Peters...

                         There's no one here, Skipper.

               Peters takes a sample container from her belt. Carefully 
               tries to capture a suspended crystal...

                                     PETERS
                         Come on...

               CLOSE UP OF THE BLOOD CRYSTAL

               and the Container; Peters' brow furrowed with concentration.

               WIDER AS A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES THE ROOM, 
               REVEALING...

               ...THE WALL BEHIND PETERS, CASED IN A FROZEN EXPLOSION OF 
               BLOOD AND TISSUE. Someone died here in a violent and terrible 
               way.

               Peters starts to look up but the flash dies away. She never 
               saw the horror behind her.

               Peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal. She 
               traps the it, returns the container to her belt.

               She moves from the antechamber into...

               Peters reaches towards a small video deck. Touches the eject 
               button. Nothing happens.

                                     PETERS

               Justin's light bounces off an even larger pressure door, 
               built like a bank vault. The Second Seal.

                         I've reached another containment

                         I'm going in.

               Justin opens the seal. It releases SLOWLY, inching open. 
               Justin squeezes through.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters takes a small probe from her belt, inserts it into 
               the video deck.

               A small laser disc emerges partway from the deck. Peters 
               pulls on it. It doesn't move.

                                     PETERS
                         It's really jammed in there.

               A shadow crosses the window behind her. Someone -- something -- 
               is in there with her...

               Peters pulls harder. Nothing. Another effort. The disc pulls 
               free. Peters spins in the zero-gravity, spinning into...

               ...A BODY floating at the helm, the face illuminated by 
               Peters' helmet lights. His swollen tongue clogs his gaping, 
               screaming mouth. His cracked and crystallized skin is crossed 
               by a network of bloated veins. He has no eyes. Just like 
               Weir's dream.

               A lighted console blocks Justin's view of the chamber beyond. 
               He drifts over to it, wipes the console clear of coolant, 
               revealing dim lights: the station has power.

               A massive sphere, 10 meters in diameter, dominates the center 
               of the second containment. Intricate machinery surrounds the 
               sphere but the globe itself is featureless, smooth; a 
               enigmatic monolith. Black ice encrusts it, giving it the

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Cooper stares in shock as Justin's safety line as it reels 
               out at an incredible rate -- 250 meters, 300 meters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT A WAVE

               surges out of the Core, bending light like a ripple on a 
               pond, pushing coolant and debris before it...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights 
               as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen 
               too fast for comprehension...

                         What the hell...

               A DEEP ROAR fills the ship. Miller rises to investigate...

               The door BLOWS APART as THE WAVE HITS, ripples through the 
               Medical Bay towards Miller...

                                     MILLER
                         Oh shit...!

               Debris swirls around him... the wave sweeps him up... SLAMS 
               him into a bulkhead...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE JUSTIN'S POV SCREEN

               the briefest suggestion of a SCREAMING FACE, obscured by 
               STATIC and ROLL before the screen CUTS to static entirely.

               The rest of the crew's POV screens go dead as...

               ...the wave hits them, threatening to tear the Lewis and 
               Clark apart. The ship shudders violently. Consoles EXPLODE 
               with sparks. Weir and the others hold on for dear life.

               An equipment rack IGNITES. Smith grabs an extinguisher, fights 
               the blaze...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK BAY

               Cooper and DJ, bracing against the bulkhead. Cooper hits the

               Cooper peers out the airlock window.

               JUSTIN'S SAFETY LINE

               passes 350 meters and accelerating...

                                     COOPER
                         350 meters... 400 meters...

                         He's in trouble. Go!

                         I'm gone!

               Cooper grabs his helmet. DJ helps him lock the helmet into 
               place with a HISS.

               The inner airlock door opens. As Cooper enters the airlock, 
               Justin's safety reel stops, the line jerking taut at 500 
               meters.

                         Boarding party, sound off... Peters, 
                         do you read me... . Peters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters' light, too, remains dark, but Neptune's blue light 
               fills the Bridge. The frozen corpse floats before her. No 
               longer a man.

               A young boy, maybe five years old. His legs are withered, 
               useless things. The skin remains a crystallized surface, but 
               the eyes look straight at her, alive.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny...

               Peters reaches out to touch the body. It falls away from 
               her. No longer her son, but the body of the astronaut. It 
               hits the door and shatters.

                         ...Peters, do you read me...

               A MAN'S VOICE, in agony, CRACKLES over Miller's radio:

                         Justin...!

               Miller trails off as RED LIGHT flickers across his visor. He 
               turns...

               MILLER

               A BURNING MAN stands in Medical/Science, a human body wreathed 
               in flame. The eyes are like sunspots. As the Burning Man 
               moves, bones and black flesh poke through the fire. He raises 
               one hand to point at Miller in accusation...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Miller's BREATH stops in his throat. His mouth works but 
               nothing comes out. He BLINKS...

               ...and the VISION is gone. Miller is alone, BREATHING hard.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Cooper enters at full speed, shooting through in a controlled 
               fall...

               ...into the Second Containment. He catches himself at the 
               console. Cooper sees Justin's safety line, cut off abruptly 
               by the darkness of the Core.

                                     COOPER
                         Oh my God...

               The darkness of the Core ripples...

               Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure 
               riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.

               Cooper catches him, holds him tight as the wave carries them 
               towards the wall. Cooper sees a control rod -- a long metal 
               spike -- coming at them. He twists his body so that they 
               miss -- barely -- before slamming into the wall.

                                     COOPER
                         Justin, do you read me? Justin... .

               Cooper pulls Justin close. Justin's head lolls to one side. 
               Unconscious.

                                     COOPER
                         Baby Bear, don't do this. Don't do

               The second wave hits. Sparks fly as consoles EXPLODE. Deep 
               in the ship metal SCREAMS, followed by the SHRIEK of escaping 
               atmosphere. An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.

               Starck checks Justin's station:

               The Bridge pressure door begins to close...and then stop.

               Starck pushes Weir ahead of her, Smith follows hard as they

               down all around them...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller meets the crew as they evacuate the Lewis and Clark. 
               Weir leads the way, eager; Smith hangs back.

                                     MILLER
                         Everybody okay?

                                     STARCK
                         We're all here.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay. Let's find out how much time 
                         we just bought.

               Miller reaches for the catch on his own helmet.

                                     DJ
                         We haven't tested the air yet. It 
                         could be contaminated...

                                     MILLER
                         No time. We need whatever's left in 
                         our suits to repair the Clark. Like 
                         it or not, this is the only oxygen 
                         for three billion kilometers.

               Miller pulls his helmet off with a HISS. He breathes deep. 
               Starck does the same, coughs.

                                     STARCK
                         It tastes bad.

                                     MILLER
                         But you can breathe it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEPTUNE ORBIT - LEWIS AND CLARK - EVENT HORIZON

               The Lewis and Clark and the Event Horizon, locked together 
               in Neptune orbit. Lights shine from the Horizon as power is 
               restored. No longer cloaked in darkness, it is revealed in 
               all its hideous glory, a nightmare etched in steel.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir moves from station to station, restoring power to each.

               Starck sits at the communications workstation. Miller watches 
               over her shoulder.

                                     STARCK
                         The antennae array's completely fried, 
                         we've got no radio, no laser, no 
                         highgain... No one's going to be 
                         coming to help us.

                                     MILLER
                         How much oh-two do we have?

                                     STARCK
                         Oxygen is not the problem.

                                     MILLER
                         Carbon dioxide?

                                     STARCK
                              (nods)
                         It's building up with every breath 
                         we take. And the CO2 filters on the 
                         Event Horizon are shot.

                                     MILLER
                         We can take the filters from the 
                         Clark...

                                     STARCK
                         I thought of that, with the filters 
                         from the Clark, we've got enough 
                         breathable air for twenty hours. 
                         After that, we'd better be on our 
                         way home.

                                     MILLER
                         What about the life readings you 
                         picked up?

                                     STARCK
                         The Event Horizon sensors show the 
                         same thing: "Bio-readings of 
                         indeterminate origin." Right before 
                         that wave hit the Clark, there was 
                         some kind of surge, right off the 
                         scale, but now it's back to its 
                         previous levels.

                                     MILLER
                         What's causing the readings?

                                     STARCK
                         I don't know, but whatever it is, 
                         it's not the crew.

                                     MILLER
                         So where is the rest of the crew? 
                         We've been over every inch of this 
                         ship and all we've found is blood. 
                         Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?

               Weir just stares at the bloodstained wall.

                                     MILLER
                         What happened here?

               Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in 
               blood...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               ...the Event Horizon in all its horrific glory, hanging skew 
               in the center of the hurricane like a mote in God's eye.

               The Lewis and Clark clings to the giant craft, as 
               insignificant as a tick. An even smaller figure clings to 
               the hull of the Lewis and Clark...

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               It's Smith, EVA in full protective gear. His magnetic boots 
               hold him to the Lewis and Clark's hull. He kneels over a 
               hole in the hull, where the metal has buckled and torn. Vapor 
               still leaks from the hole into space.

                                     SMITH
                         Captain Miller, you copy?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?

                                     SMITH
                         I've found a six inch fracture in 
                         the outer hull. We should be able to 
                         repair it and re-pressurize, it's 
                         gonna take some time.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         We don't have time, Smith. In twenty 
                         hours we run out of air.

                                     SMITH
                         Understood.

               Smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole. The gel freezes 
               in place. Smith reaches to his belt, pulls out a ZERO-G 
               NAILGUN. Presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into 
               place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Justin lies unmoving on a table. His eyes are open, staring 
               at a smear of blood on the ceiling.

               A needle slides into the skin below his eye. He doesn't 
               respond.

               DJ removes the needle. It glistens with blood. He looks up 
               at Miller and Peters.

                                     MILLER
                         How is he?

                                     DJ
                         His vitals are stable, but he's 
                         unresponsive to stimuli. He might 
                         wake up in fifteen minutes. He might 
                         not wake up at all.

                                     PETERS
                         What happened to him?

               DJ shakes his head. Miller eyes the bloodstain above them.

                                     MILLER
                         DJ, take samples from these stains, 
                         compare them to medical records, I 
                         want to know whose blood this is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Gravity has scattered debris and freeze-dried blood about 
               the room. The crew (Justin and Smith excepted) tries to relax 
               on the chairs of dead men. Their faces are wan and haggard.

               Weir relaxes at the table. Unlike the others, he seems almost 
               at ease. DJ remains forever stoic; Starck, animated and 
               nervous. Cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex 
               action.

               Miller stares at a video monitor, watching Smith repair the 
               Lewis and Clark. He turns from the window.

                                     MILLER
                         Okay, people, there's been a change 
                         in the mission. In less than eighteen 
                         hours, we will run out of breathable 
                         air. Our primary objective is now 
                         survival. That means we focus on 
                         repairing the Lewis and Clark and 
                         salvaging whatever will buy us more 
                         time.
                              (pause)
                         Our secondary objective is finding 
                         out what happened to this ship and 
                         its crew. Two months from now, I 
                         fully intend to be standing in front 
                         of the good Admiral giving my report, 
                         and I'd like to have more than my 
                         dick in my hands.

               Grim smiles all around.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters, I want you to go through the 
                         ship's log, see if we can't find 
                         some answers.

                                     PETERS
                         I can use the station in Medical, 
                         keep an eye on Justin...

                                     MILLER
                         Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat 
                         the bio-scan...

                                     STARCK
                         What's the point? I'll just get the 
                         same thing...

                                     MILLER
                         Not acceptable. I want to know what's 
                         causing those readings. If the crew 
                         is dead, I want the bodies, I want 
                         the crew found.

                                     STARCK
                         I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, 
                         amylase proteins.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it. Dr. Weir...

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

                                     MILLER
                         One of my men is down. I want to 
                         know what happened to him.

                                     COOPER
                         I told you. He was inside the Core...

               Weir starts shaking his head.

                                     COOPER
                         It was like... nothing was there... 
                         and then Justin appeared and the 
                         Core... became metal...

                                     WEIR
                              (cutting him off)
                         No, he didn't.

                                     COOPER
                         You weren't there. I saw it.

                                     WEIR
                         Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you 
                         really see, because what you're 
                         describing is not physically 
                         possible...

               Cooper throws the ball at him, hard. Weir ducks. It bounces 
               wildly around the room. Miller catches it.

                                     MILLER
                         Cooper! Enough!

               Cooper sits down.

                                     MILLER
                              (turning on Weir)
                         Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever 
                         happened to him could happen to all 
                         of us.

               Beat.

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know what happened to Justin.

                                     COOPER
                         I'm telling you, I saw it...

                                     WEIR
                         What you saw could have been an 
                         optical effect caused by gravitational 
                         distortion.

                              (turning on Weir)
                         I know what I saw and it wasn't a 
                         fucking "optical effect!"

                                     MILLER
                         Hold on, what's this "gravitational 
                         distortion?"

                                     WEIR
                         It's possible that a burst of gravity 
                         waves escaped from the Core, 
                         distorting space-time. They could be 
                         what hit the Lewis and Clark.

                                     MILLER
                         What could cause them?
                              (Weir doesn't answer)
                         What's in the Core?

                                     WEIR
                         It's complicated...

                                     MILLER
                         How much time do you need? We have 
                         seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. 
                         Now: what is in the Core?

               Beat. Here comes another bomb...

                                     WEIR
                         A black hole.

               The crew stares at him, stunned.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Miller, Starck and Weir stand before the Core. Dark ominous 
               structures loom around them, glistening with coolant. The 
               PULSE of the ship is loud here, a deep THRUM that steals 
               their breath. Weir's voice is a reverent WHISPER:

                                     WEIR
                         That's how the gravity drive works, 
                         you see: it focuses the black hole's 
                         immense gravitational power to create 
                         the gateway. That's how the Event 
                         Horizon travels faster than light.

                                     STARCK
                         I can't believe we built this.

                                     MILLER
                         It's insane.

                                     WEIR
                         "Insane?" The finest astronauts fought 
                         to be posted to this ship. It would 
                         take the Lewis and Clark a thousand 
                         years to reach our closest star. The 
                         Event Horizon could be there in a 
                         day...

                                     MILLER
                         If it worked.

                                     WEIR
                         If it worked, yes.

               They stare at the Core, the surrounding machinery moving in 
               a slow giant's dance. A trick of the eye, or does the Core 
               stare back at them?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

                                     MILLER
                         I want this room sealed. The Second 
                         Containment is off limits.

                                     WEIR
                         There's no danger. The black hole is 
                         contained behind three magnetic 
                         fields, it's under control.

                                     MILLER
                         Your black hole damn near ripped my 
                         ship apart. It may have killed one 
                         of my men.
                              (beat)
                         No one goes near that thing.

               until its darkness fills the screen...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Peters sits before the computer workstation, running the 
               ship's log, forwarding through hours of boring footage. Rubs 
               her eyes.

               The lights flicker.

               Peters hears something RUSTLING behind her. She turns...

                                     PETERS
                         Justin...?

               Justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table. 
               Comatose. Peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel.

               Peters hears the sound again, FINGERNAILS ON PLASTIC. She 
               moves past Justin...

               ...past several empty tables, covered with clear plastic...

               ...to the last table. She stares in shock.

               THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH THE PLASTIC COVER

               She slowly reaches out. Lifts the cover.

               Her son DENNY looks at her and GIGGLES. She GASPS. The scalpel 
               drops to the floor at her feet.

               Denny reaches up to her, to be picked up...

                                     DENNY
                         Mommy...

               ...but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms 
               like a bag full of snakes...

               Peters drops the plastic and backs away.

                                     DJ (O.S.)
                         Peters?

               She turns. DJ stands in the doorway, holding blood samples.

               Peters turns back, but her son is gone.

               DJ reads her expression.

                                     DJ
                         What's wrong?

                                     PETERS
                         Nothing. It's nothing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Smith enters. He closes the Outer Airlock door. Atmosphere

                                     SMITH
                         I'd rather spend the next twelve 
                         hours Outside than another five 
                         minutes in this can. This ship is 
                         bad. It watches you.

                                     COOPER
                         What?

                         You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: 
                         trying to go faster'n light, that's 
                         like the Tower of Babel.

                                     COOPER
                         Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical 
                         on me.

                         You know what happened to the Tower 
                         of Babel, don't you? It fell down.

               Starck programs the sensor workstation. She glances over at 
               Weir: sitting at a computer terminal, his face rapt as data 
               flashes by. His lips move, muttering to himself.

                                     STARCK
                         Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.

                                     WEIR
                         Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved 
                         the Event Horizon more than I loved 
                         her. I told her that wasn't true, I 
                         just knew the Event Horizon better, 
                         that's all.

                                     STARCK
                         Claire is your wife?

                                     WEIR
                         Yes.

                                     STARCK
                         It must be hard, being so far away 
                         from her.

                                     WEIR
                         Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years 
                         now.

                                     STARCK
                         I'm sorry.

               Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen.

                                     WEIR
                         These things happen.

                              on the screen)
                         Wait a minute, that's not right...

               He fingers fly across the keyboard, double-checking the data.

               Miller leans over Weir's shoulder.

                                     MILLER
                         You have something, Dr. Weir?

                         The date.

                                     MILLER
                         What about it?

                                     WEIR
                         The Event Horizon's computer think's

                         Exactly. The ship's internal clock 
                         is off by seven years.

                         Maybe a power interruption crashed

                         No, there's no evidence of a surge 
                         or spike of any kind. It's as if 
                         time just... stopped for seven years.

                              (he shakes his head)
                         The Event Horizon has passed beyond

                         I wonder if they ever made it.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR (FOR VIDEO)

               Corridor. The entire original crew assembled, playing catch 
               with the stuffed dog

                         I just want to say how proud I am of 
                         my crew. I'd like to name my station 
                         heads Chris Chambers, Janice Rubin, 
                         Dick Smith, Tom Fender and Stacie 
                         Collins. And to Bill Weir and all 
                         the scientists that got us here.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (FOR VIDEO)

               Bridge. KILPACK addresses the camera. His face is flushed 
               with excitement.

                                     KILPACK
                         I... uh, I had something historic to 
                         say, and I wrote it down but I... I 
                         can't find it. Ave, atque, vale. 
                         Hail and farewell.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               A BURST of static...

               ...followed by an inhuman HOWL of FEEDBACK, like screaming 
               hyaenas, almost alive. Through the swirl of static, the 
               suggestion of movement.

               Miller freezes the frame. He squints at the screen...

               POV MILLER

               Obscured by static, the image is blurred beyond comprehension.

                                     MILLER
                         What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?

                                     WEIR
                         I don't know.

                                     PETERS
                         I can run the image through a series 
                         of filters, try to clean it up.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

               Suddenly, the lights fade out. Dim emergency lighting snaps 
               on...

                                     PETERS
                         What's happening...?

                                     DJ
                         A power drain --

                                     MILLER
                         We barely have enough power for life 
                         support as it is, if we can't stop 
                         the drain, we're not gonna make it.

                                     WEIR
                         The Core...!

               Weir heads for the door.

                                     MILLER
                         Wait!

               But Weir has vanished into the corridor.

                                     MILLER
                         The rest of you, stay here, I don't 
                         want anyone else going near that 
                         thing.

               Miller follows after Weir.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               The Second Containment Seal opens. Weir is about to enter 
               when Miller stops him. He checks a Geiger counter. It is 
               silent.

                                     MILLER
                         No radiation. What's causing the 
                         drain?

               Weir crosses to a console. Frowns.

                                     WEIR
                              (shakes his head)
                         The magnetic fields are holding. 
                         Maybe a short in the fail-safe 
                         circuit. I'll check it out.

               Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel. 
               The panel falls away, revealing a cramped duct leading into 
               the ship's circuitry.

               Weir climbs into the duct. Miller hands him a flashlight and 
               a toolkit.

                                     MILLER
                         We don't get the power back, our 
                         air's gonna go bad.

                                     WEIR
                         Check the Core for radiation. Carbon 
                         dioxide may be the least of our 
                         worries.

               Weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped shaft. He counts off 
               circuit panels as he goes:

                                     WEIR
                         E-three... E-five... E-seven... where 
                         are you...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Miller slogs through the coolant to the Core. Stares at it. 
               It remains metallic, mundane.

               He pulls out a Geiger counter and crosses to the reactor 
               shell. Examines a gleaming weld. The Geiger counter CLICKS 
               slowly: no leak.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               A yellow light starts flashing on the engineering board. 
               Starck's eyes widen: the engineering sections flash 
               yellow...and green...

                                     STARCK
                         What the hell...

               STARCK'S POV

               as the bio-scan goes wild.

                                     STARCK
                              (into intercom)
                         Skipper, the bio-scan just went off 
                         the scale...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Justin shakes on the bed in an epileptic fit. DJ rushes to 
               him.

                                     DJ
                         Justin! Can you hear me? Justin!

               Justin's eyes remain unfocused, unseeing as he tries to speak.

               DJ leans in close, trying to hear him speak...

               Justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled, 
               tortured voice:

                                     JUSTIN
                         THE DARK IS COMING...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Weir stops before module E-12. Hears a faint HISSING and 
               POPPING.

                                     WEIR
                         There you are.

               He uses a screwdriver to open up the module. Reveals a series 
               of circuit boards. One SPARKS. Weir plucks the damaged chips 
               and starts running a by-pass.

               His flashlight flickers. He bangs it against the duct wall. 
               It grows dimmer. Goes out.

                                     WEIR
                         Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to 
                         have a problem with my light.

               A single DRIP of water in the darkness...

                                     WEIR
                              (beat, hushed)
                         Captain Miller?

               Another DRIP, then a woman's VOICE like a distant echo:

                                     VOICE
                         Billy.

               Weir starts at the sound. He recognizes the voice.

               She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in 
               his ear:

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Billy. Help me. I'm so cold.

               Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Even the emergency lights go out. Total darkness.

                                     MILLER
                         We just lost all power in here. Dr. 
                         Weir...?

               Miller's voice trails off as he looks towards the Core. A 
               red glow reflects across his eyes. He takes a few steps away 
               from the reactor. He stares...

               ...at the BURNING MAN, standing before the Core. The deep 
               ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment.

               It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in 
               accusation.

                                     BURNING MAN
                         Don't leave me...

               Miller stares as the Burning Man turns and vanishes into a 
               bulkhead, leaving the wall blackened and burned with his 
               passing.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - WEIR'S DUCT

               Total darkness. Weir's breath ECHOES in the cramped metal 
               space.

                                     WEIR
                              (a whisper)
                         Claire...?

               Weir bangs his flashlight. Again. Again...

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Help me. I'm so cold.

               The flashlight flickers...

               Claire's face is inches from Weir's.

                                     CLAIRE
                         So cold.

               His flashlight flickers again, snaps on...

               She is gone. Weir lets his head fall to the floor of the 
               deck, breathing in ragged SOBS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               The crew, except for Cooper. DJ whets a scalpel against the 
               leg of his jumpsuit, an unconscious gesture. FLICK. FLICK. 
               FLICK.

                                     DJ
                         Carbon dioxide poisoning produces 
                         hallucinations, impaired judgement...

                                     MILLER
                         Goddammit, DJ, it was not a 
                         hallucination! I saw a man, he was 
                         on fire. And then he disappeared.

                                     STARCK
                         Maybe one of the original crew?

                                     MILLER
                         No. It was someone else.

                                     STARCK
                         Who?

                                     MILLER
                              (ignoring the question)
                         Dr. Weir, you were right there, you 
                         must have heard something, seen 
                         something...

                                     WEIR
                         No. I saw nothing.

                                     PETERS
                         I did.

               All heads turn to her.

                                     PETERS
                         About an hour ago. In medical. I saw 
                         my son. He was lying on one of the 
                         examination tables and his legs 
                         were...
                              (she trails off)

                                     WEIR
                         Isn't it possible that you were 
                         traumatized by finding the body on 
                         the bridge?

                                     PETERS
                         I've seen bodies before. This is 
                         different.

               She falls silent, unwilling to say more.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters is right. Its like something 
                         reaching into your mind. Seeing your 
                         thoughts and making them real. Smith, 
                         did you or Cooper experience anything 
                         unusual?

               Smith, leaning against the doorway:

                                     SMITH
                         I didn't see anything and I don't 
                         have to see anything. This ship is 
                         fucked.

                                     WEIR
                         Thank you for that scientific 
                         analysis, Mister Smith.

                                     SMITH
                              (exploding)
                         Hey! You don't need to be a scientist 
                         figure it out...

                                     MILLER
                         Smith...

               Weir's face is stone.

                                     SMITH
                         ...you break all the laws of physics, 
                         you think there won't be a price? 
                         You already killed the first crew...

                                     MILLER
                         That's enough!

               DJ lays one hand on Smith's shoulder to calm him...

               Smith reacts violently, turning on DJ, shoving him back. DJ 
               uses Smith's momentum to spin the pilot into the wall. He 
               presses his scalpel just below Smith's ear...

                                     MILLER
                         DJ!!

               DJ freezes. The scalpel falls from his hands. He releases 
               Smith.

                                     DJ
                         I'm sorry, I... I don't know why I 
                         did that.

                                     WEIR
                              (wry)
                         Carbon dioxide.

               Smith goes for Weir.

                                     SMITH
                         He's fucking lying, you know 
                         something...!

               Miller heads him off, grabs him.

                                     MILLER
                         That's it, that's enough for one 
                         day, Smith! I need you back on the 
                         Clark, I need you calm, I need you 
                         using your head, you make a mistake 
                         out there, none of are getting home, 
                         you understand?

               Smith calms.

                                     SMITH
                         Sir.

                                     MILLER
                         Get outside, go back to work. I'll 
                         join you shortly.

               Smith leaves.

                                     MILLER
                         We're a long way from home and we're 
                         in a bad place. Let's not make it 
                         worse. If anyone has any constructive 
                         suggestions, now is the time.

                                     WEIR
                         I think I can stabilize the fields 
                         around the singularity, that should 
                         prevent another power drain.

                                     MILLER
                         Do it.

                                     DJ
                         To conserve our oxygen, we should 
                         severely restrict our activity. Anyone 
                         who can should get some sleep.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't need sleep, DJ. I need 
                         answers.

               Miller exits. Starck follows.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               STARCK TRAILS MILLER:

                                     STARCK
                         Miller...

                                     MILLER
                              (not slowing)
                         What is it, Starck?

                                     STARCK
                         ...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA 
                         filter. The results were bio-readings 
                         of indeterminate origin...

                                     MILLER
                              (simultaneous)
                         "...bio-readings of indeterminate 
                         origin," don't you have anything 
                         useful to tell me?

                                     STARCK
                         I've got a theory.

               Miller stops.

                                     MILLER
                         Go ahead.

                                     STARCK
                         There was a another surge in the bio-
                         readings right before you... you saw 
                         what you saw. We picked up a similar 
                         readings right before the Clarke was 
                         damaged. What if there were a 
                         connection between the two? The 
                         gravity waves, the hallucination, 
                         all part of an defensive reaction, 
                         like an immune system...

               Miller starts walking again.

                                     MILLER
                         I don't need to hear this.

               She rushes to follow.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 2

               Miller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay:

                                     STARCK
                         You've got to listen...

                                     MILLER
                         To what? What are you saying? This 
                         ship is alive?

                                     STARCK
                         I didn't say that, I said the bio-
                         readings correspond to what happened 
                         to you, the ship is reacting to us...

                                     MILLER
                         We're hanging on by our fingernails 
                         and you're giving me bullshit 
                         stories...

               She grabs him by the arm.

                                     STARCK
                         It's not bullshit, it's the only 
                         conclusion the data supports...

                                     MILLER
                         Starck, do you know how crazy that 
                         sounds? It's impossible.

                                     STARCK
                         I know that.

               Beat. Miller allows himself to relax.

                                     MILLER
                         If you knew it was impossible, then 
                         why'd you waste my time?

                                     STARCK
                         I thought you wanted an answer. And 
                         that's the only one I have.

               Miller pulls an EVA suit from the wall, starts putting it 
               on.

                                     MILLER
                         What I want is to survive the next 
                         ten hours.

                                     STARCK
                              (checks her watch)
                         Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm going outside to work on the 
                         Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone 
                         what you just told me. We've got 
                         enough to worry about.

               She nods. He locks his helmet into place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               Establish.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               The ship seems to breathe. The lights flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The ship seems to breathe. The lights 
               flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The ship seems to breathe. The lights 
               flicker...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Peters has fallen asleep in her chair.

               On the threshold of hearing, a distant POUNDING. Not a 
               heartbeat. Metal on metal. Something trying to get out. 
               Something trying to get in.

               Peters wakes with a start.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin...?

               She turns. Justin lies on the floor in a heap, completely 
               covered by his sheet. She crosses to him. Pulls back the 
               sheet...

               Revealing empty nitrogen tanks.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin!

               She looks up, eyes widening, as...

               The IV bottles fill with blood. Blood fills the X-ray 
               lightboxes, it surges up from gutters in the floor...

               And the pounding grows louder... LOUDER... almost to 
               Medical...

               The spell breaks and she RUNS...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Peters sprints, the SOUND BOOMING after her, almost on her 
               heels...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE ANTECHAMBER

               Peters darts into the Bridge Antechamber. She SLAMS the 
               pressure door shut behind her, CUTTING OFF the sound.

               She turns. Weir, DJ, Starck look up from their work, staring 
               at her.

                                     DJ
                         What's wrong?

                                     PETERS
                         You didn't hear it? You must have 
                         heard it!

                                     STARCK
                         Heard what?

               Beat. Peters starts to LAUGH, part hysteria, part relief.

                                     PETERS
                         Oh... nothing...

               DJ crosses to Peters, concerned.

                                     DJ
                         Sit down...

               As he reaches out to touch her...

               BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. POUNDING ON THE DOOR ITSELF

               Peters SCREAMS. DJ clutches her to him, backs away from the 
               door.

               The POUNDING grows louder. LOUDER. The door vibrates with 
               each blow Starck puts her hands over her ears. Peters SCREAMS 
               at the door.

                                     PETERS
                         Stop it! Stop it!

               But the POUNDING intensifies, metal GROANING under incredible 
               pressure.

                                     DJ
                              (shouting to be heard)
                         What is it?

               Weir slowly walks to the door.

                                     STARCK
                         What are you doing?

                                     WEIR
                         It wants me. I have to go.

               He reaches for the door.

                                     STARCK
                         No...!

               Starck grabs him. He tries to shake her off, but she traps 
               his arm in a wrist-lock. He turns on her, his face furious...

               ...and the POUNDING stops. They remain frozen for a moment. 
               Afraid to breathe.

               Weir shakes the trance.

                                     STARCK
                         In our current environment, Dr. Weir, 
                         self-control is an asset.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm alright. Please.

               In the distance, the POUNDING begins again. Moving away from 
               them.

               The ship systems station BEEPS. A warning light flashes on 
               the console.

                                     STARCK
                         What is it?

                                     WEIR
                         The forward airlock.

                                     STARCK
                              (into radio)
                         Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in 
                         the airlock?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         That's a negative, Starck.

                                     PETERS
                              (realization)
                         Justin.

               Peters, Starck and DJ rush from the Bridge, leaving Weir 
               behind.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR NO. 2 - WITH 
               AIRLOCKS

               Peters leads Starck and DJ down the corridor towards the 
               Forward Airlock bay. They round a corner in time to see a 
               figure moving in the Airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               They race into the bay even as Justin steps into the Airlock. 
               He is naked.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin, no!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes. He 
               reaches out to the airlock control.

               The pressure door shuts with a HISS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Miller, Smith and Cooper cling to the Lewis and Clark's hull. 
               They carefully remove an access panel, revealing scorched 
               wiring.

                                     COOPER
                         We'll have to re-route through the 
                         port conduit to the APU.

                                     SMITH
                         What about the accumulator...?

               Starck's VOICE breaks in:

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)

                         What's going on in there, Starck?

                              (radio)
                         Justin's in the airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Starck at the intercom. The others huddle by the door.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         What?

                                     STARCK
                         He's awake, he's in the airlock, 
                         he's not wearing a suit.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

                                     MILLER
                              (to Cooper)
                         Stay here! Don't stop working!

                                     COOPER
                         But Justin...

                                     MILLER
                         I'll get him.

               Miller swings his body around, heads across the umbilicus to 
               the Event Horizon. He moves in great leaps, using the magnetic 
               plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off 
               into Neptune's thin atmosphere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Starck works the airlock control panel without success.

                                     STARCK
                         He's engaged the override.

                                     PETERS
                         Can you shut it down?

               She opens the Airlock access panel.

                                     STARCK
                         I'll try. DJ, you better get your 
                         bag of tricks.

               DJ nods, runs off. Peters bangs on the Airlock door.

                                     PETERS
                         Justin! Open the door!

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door:

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         Open the door!

               Justin turns off the artificial gravity. He begins to float 
               gently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

               Miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the 
               Event Horizon.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm on my way, Starck.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (radio)

                         override, we can't open the inner 
                         door.

               Miller curses under his breath, moves even faster...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Peters, against the window:

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         The door, Justin! Open the door!

               He fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door. And beyond 
               it, space. He speaks in a flat monotone:

                                     JUSTIN
                         Did you hear it?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               They are stunned to hear his voice. Peters answers:

                                     PETERS
                         Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.

                                     STARCK
                         Keep him talking.

                                     PETERS
                         Do you know what it was?

                                     JUSTIN
                              (muffled)
                         It gets inside you. It shows you 
                         things... horrible things...

                                     JUSTIN
                         ...can't describe it... there are no 
                         words...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir sits alone, listening to the VOICES on the intercom.

                                     PETERS (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         What, Justin, what shows you?

                              (intercom)
                         It won't stop, it goes on and on and 
                         on...

                                     PETERS (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         What does?

                                     JUSTIN (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         The dark inside me.

               A LOW MOAN escapes Weir's lips. He cradles his head in his 
               hands.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - (MILLER'S CROSSING)

               Miller races across the surface of the Event Horizon, the 
               only sounds, his LABOURED BREATHING, and Justin's tortured 
               VOICE, patched through on his radio:

                                     JUSTIN (O.S.)
                              (radio)
                         ...It's inside and it eats and eats 
                         until there's nothing left.

                              (radio)
                         "The dark inside..."? I don't 
                         understand.

                         waiting for me. They're waiting for 
                         you. I won't go back there... I 
                         won't...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 3

               Peters presses her face against the Airlock window, trying 
               to calm him:

                                     PETERS
                         Justin, look at me. Look at me. Open 
                         this door.

               DJ runs up with his medkit.

                                     STARCK
                         I don't think she can talk him down. 
                         We need a sedative.

                                     DJ
                         If he opens the outer door he'll 
                         turn inside-out.

               Starck's hands fly as she re-wires the circuits. Sweat beads 
               her face.

                                     STARCK
                         Almost got it.

                         Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...

               Justin looks at her with dead eyes. He reaches out to gently 
               touch the glass between them.

                                     JUSTIN
                         If you could see the things I've 
                         seen, you wouldn't try to stop me. 
                         You'd come with me.

               Justin's hand moves to the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR control. 
               Hesitates... then floats to the OUTER AIRLOCK control. Hits 
               it.

                                     PETERS
                              (muffled)
                         NOOO!

               A yellow warning light flashes. A warning klaxon WHOOPS, 
               deafening.

               Justin jerks his hands to his ears, closes his eyes...

                         Hey, Mama-Bear... what are doing...?

               And then he realizes where he is...and what is about to 
               happen.

                                     JUSTIN

                         I can't! The inner door can't open 
                         once the outer door has been

               recklessly leaping from one beam to another, trying to build 
               up speed.

               Miller moves faster and faster, his BREATH echoing in his 
               helmet. He can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep 
               chasm in the ship's superstructure. If he misses this jump, 
               Justin will not be the only man to die today.

               He doesn't hesitate but leaps, soaring across the chasm 
               towards the airlock.

               Miller's words give Justin hope. He regains some control.

                         Okay... okay...

               Justin breathes hard and follows Miller's hurried

                         you can!

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller lands on the superstructure opposite the exterior 
               airlock.

                                     MILLER
                              (radio)
                         Exhale everything you got, Baby Bear, 
                         we can't have any air in those lungs, 
                         blow it all out...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes.

                                     JUSTIN
                         Oh god --

               He wheezes out all his air...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller squats on the girder, ready to push off. He focuses 
               on the 5 meters of space between him and the airlock...

               The outer doors OPEN...

               The rush of escaping atmosphere carries Justin's body out...

               Miller pushes off... catches Justin's body... sending them 
               both back towards the open Airlock...

               Ice forms on Justin's body. His veins bulge. Blood fountains 
               from his noise and mouth, forming a red icicle over his face.

               Miller pulls him into the Airlock. Five seconds have passed 
               since the airlock door opened.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- AIRLOCK NO. 3

               Miller closes the Airlock behind them. Air HISSES into the 
               chamber. Justin's body hits the deck as "normal" gravity 
               exerts itself.

               Miller opens the Inner Door. Peters and DJ rush in.

                                     PETERS
                         Oh God... Justin...

               DJ puts a tube in the Justin's mouth immediately, feeding 
               him oxygen.

                                     PETERS
                         I've got a pulse, he's alive...

                                     DJ
                         Pressure?

                                     PETERS
                         90 over 50 and falling... .

                                     DJ
                         He's crashing...

               Blood bubbles from Justin's mouth and eyes. He GASPS, then 
               SCREAMS, spraying blood from his mouth.

                                     DJ
                         He can breathe. That's good. Let's 
                         get him to Medical, go, go!

               Starck helps DJ and Peters carry Justin from the Airlock. 
               Miller sits there, exhausted. Reaches up and pulls his helmet 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         One thing at a time, let's keep him 
                         breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's 
                         fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding 
                         out...

               One of the tanks has been activated. Swaddled in bandages, 
               Justin floats within, suspended in green gel. The others -- 
               DJ, Starck, Peters, Miller, Weir -- look exhausted.

                                     DJ
                         He'll live... if we ever make it 
                         back.

                                     MILLER
                         We'll make it.

                         CO2 levels will reach toxic levels 
                         in four hours.

               Peters stands, looking at Justin's ravaged form floating in 
               the tank.

                                     MILLER
                              (gently)
                         Peters. We need to know what happened 
                         to the crew. Before it happens to 
                         us.

                                     PETERS
                              (weakly)
                         I'll get back to the log. But on the 
                         bridge, I won't go back, back in 
                         there...

                                     MILLER
                         Thanks.

               Peters exits.

                         Justin said something about, "The 
                         dark inside me..." What did he mean?

                                     WEIR
                         It means nothing.

                                     MILLER
                         Is that your "expert opinion?" The 
                         only answer we've had out of you is 
                         "I don't know."

                                     WEIR
                         Justin just tried to kill himself. 
                         The man is clearly insane.

                                     DJ
                         How would you explain your own 
                         behavior?

                                     WEIR
                         What?

                         On the bridge. You said "it" wanted 
                         you.

               Weir glances at Justin...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY -- POV OF CLAIRE

               But it's not Justin in the tank. It's his wife CLAIRE, naked, 
               wet, dead. Weir stares at her.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GRAVITY COUCH BAY

                                     WEIR
                         I said that?

                                     DJ
                         Yes. You did.

               Weir blinks. Justin floats in the grav couch. Weir turns 
               back to the others.

                                     WEIR
                         I don't remember saying that.
                              (covers with a joke)
                         Maybe I'm insane, too.

               Weir exits.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON -- GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller follows Weir out of the Gravity Couch Bay.

                         I want to know what caused that noise. 
                         I want to know why one of my crew 
                         tried to throw himself out of the 
                         airlock.

                         Thermal changes in the hull could 
                         have caused the metal to expand and 
                         contract very suddenly, causing 
                         reverberations --

                              (exploding)
                         That's bullshit and you know it! You 
                         built this fucking ship and all I've 
                         heard from you is bullshit!

                                     WEIR
                         What do you want me to say?

                                     MILLER
                         You said this ship creates a 
                         gateway...

                                     WEIR
                         Yes...

                                     MILLER
                         To what? Where did this ship go? 
                         Where did you send it?

                                     WEIR

                         Where has it been for the past seven 
                         years?

                         I DON'T KNOW!
                              (beat, calm again)
                         I don't know. There's a lot of things 
                         going on here that I don't understand. 
                         Truth takes time.

                                     MILLER
                         That's exactly what we don't have, 
                         Doctor.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller moves through the maze of the ship, heading for the 
               Bridge.

               As he reaches a junction, he hears...

               ...A DISTANT CRY...

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me...!

               Miller wheels like a cat, staring wildly down the branching 
               corridors.

               Nothing. He is alone. Miller leans against the wall, sinks 
               to the floor, rests his head in his hands.

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL

               The grotesque ship continues it's orbit as the moon Triton 
               eclipses the sun. Darkness swallows all.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               DJ enters, checks Justin's display.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                         Any change?

               DJ turns, surprised. Miller sits, barely visible in the dark.

                                     DJ
                         No. No change.
                              (beat)
                         I've analyzed Justin's blood samples. 
                         There's no evidence of excessive 
                         levels of carbon dioxide. Or anything 
                         else out of ordinary.

               A grim LAUGH from Miller.

                                     MILLER
                         Of course not. Justin just climbed 
                         into the airlock because he felt 
                         like it. Just one of those things.
                              (beat)
                         I swore I'd never lose another man. 
                         I came close today. Real close.

                                     DJ
                         "Another man?" Who?

               Miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his 
               jumpsuit.

                                     MILLER
                         It was on the Goliath. There was 
                         this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a 
                         lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, 
                         from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught 
                         when the pressure doors sealed, one 
                         closed on his arm. Severed it at the 
                         wrist. The pain of that must have 
                         been... He passed out and...

               Miller trails off. DJ waits patiently. Finally:

                                     MILLER
                         I, I tried to go back for him, to 
                         save him, but I couldn't get to him 
                         in time. The fire... Have you ever 
                         seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like 
                         a liquid, it slides over everything. 
                         It was like a wave breaking over 
                         him, a wave of fire. And then he was 
                         gone.
                              (beat)
                         I never told anyone until now. But 
                         this ship knew, DJ. It knows about 
                         the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. 
                         It knows our secrets. It knows what 
                         we're afraid of.
                              (beat, wan smile)
                         And now you're going to tell me it's 
                         carbon dioxide.

                                     DJ
                         No.

               Miller sees something in DJ's expression.

                                     MILLER
                         What is it?

                                     DJ
                         I've been listening to the 
                         transmission. And I think Houston 
                         made a mistake in the translation.

                                     MILLER
                         Go on.

               DJ plays the recording again. Stops it abruptly.

                                     DJ
                         They thought it said, "Liberatis 
                         me," "Save me," but it's not "me." 
                         It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."

                                     MILLER
                         It's not a distress call. It's a 
                         warning.

                                     DJ
                         It gets worse.

               Miller stares at him.

                                     DJ
                         It's very hard to make out, but listen 
                         to this final part.

               He plays the recording again.

                                     DJ
                         Do you hear it? Right there.

                                     MILLER
                         Hear what?

                                     DJ
                         It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," 
                         from; "infera," the ablative case of 
                         "inferi." "Hell."

                                     MILLER
                         "Save yourself. From Hell."
                              (beat)
                         What are you saying, are you saying 
                         that this ship is possessed?

                                     DJ
                         No. I don't believe in that sort of 
                         thing.
                              (beat)
                         But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship 
                         has passed beyond the boundaries of 
                         our universe, of reality. Who knows 
                         where this ship has been... What 
                         it's seen...
                              (beat)
                         And what it's brought back with it.

               DJ looks at Miller. He does not have an answer. The intercom 
               CRACKLES:

                                     COOPER (O.S.)

                         repressurize the Clark.

                                     MILLER
                              (into intercom)
                         On my way.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               Miller stands in his EVA suit in the darkened bridge. He 
               twists a manual valve.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright, Cooper.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - HULL SECTION

               Cooper looks at Smith.

                                     COOPER
                         Cross your fingers.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

               A moment later, mist flows from the vents into the bridge, 
               filling it with atmosphere. Miller watches the pressure rise 
               on his suit gauge.

                                     SMITH (O.S.)

                         gimme twenty minutes to plug the

                         You got it, Coop.

               Miller removes his helmet. Breathes deep.

                                     MILLER
                         Back in business.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Peters sits in front of the screen. The log is still 
               distorted.

               Frustrated, she types in a series of instructions. Get to 
               her feet.

                                     PETERS
                         You got any coffee?

                                     STARCK
                         It's cold.

                                     PETERS
                         I don't care.

               Behind Peters, the process refines, accelerates... pieces 
               coming together like a jigsaw...

               Peters turns around. Sees the screen. The coffee slips from 
               her hand to the floor.

                                     PETERS
                              (tiny voice)
                         Starck...

               Starck turns, sees the screen.

                         Sweet Jesus. Miller... MILLER!

               Miller, Starck, DJ watch the video. Peters turns away, 
               miserable. Unable to watch...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE THE VIDEO SCREEN

               still distorted by static and roll, but finally lucid: FOUR 
               ORIGINAL CREW of the Event Horizon. On the Bridge.

               ONE MAN dislocates his shoulder with a WET POPPING sound as 
               he shoves his arm down his own throat. Blood bubbles from 
               his nose. With a SHUCKING sound, he pulls his stomach out 
               his mouth...

               Behind him, a MAN and WOMAN fuck, covered with blood. She 
               bites through his neck. His head lolls to the other side. 
               She buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her 
               again and again...

               Presiding over them, KILPACK. His eyes are bloody holes. His 
               hands reach out in offering. In the palms of his hands, his 
               eyes.

               Kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an INHUMAN VOICE.

                                     KILPACK
                         Liberatis tutemet ex infera...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller switches off the video. No one says anything.

                                     MILLER
                         We're leaving.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't, your orders are specific...

                                     MILLER
                         "...to rescue the crew and salvage 
                         the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. 
                         Weir. This ship killed them. And now 
                         it's killing us.

                                     WEIR
                         You're insane. You've lost your mind.

                                     MILLER
                         Maybe you're right. But it's still 
                         my command, and I have leeway to 
                         abort when I feel there is an 
                         unacceptable threat to my crew. And 
                         I think there is.

                         back onto the Clark.

                         It's done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Peters enters, carrying heavy CO2 scrubbers. Smith stops 
               her.

                         pulled the plug on the mission.

               Smith smiles.

               Weir follows Miller down the Corridor.

                                     WEIR
                         What about my ship?

                                     MILLER
                         We will take the Lewis and Clark to 
                         a safe distance and then launch tac 
                         missiles at the Event Horizon until 
                         I am satisfied that she has been 
                         destroyed.

                                     MILLER
                         Watch me.

               Miller turns to walk away. Weir grabs Miller, wheeling him 
               around, almost frenzied.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't kill her, I won't let you! 
                         I lost her once, I will not lose her 
                         again...!

               Miller shoves Weir back into the wall. The two stare at each 
               other. Adversaries...

               The lights cut to emergency lighting.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               Miller and Weir are barely visible in the darkness.

                                     MILLER
                         Goddammit! Starck, get those files 
                         and vacate. I want off this ship.

               He releases the intercom.

               Weir's voice is a WHISPER as he backs into the shadows.

                                     WEIR
                         You can't leave. She won't let you.

                                     MILLER
                         Just get your gear back onto the 
                         Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll 
                         find yourself looking for a ride 
                         home.

               Weir is swallowed by the darkness.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                         I am home.

               REGULAR LIGHTING snaps on...

               Miller looks around. Dr. Weir has vanished.

                                     MILLER
                         Weir? WEIR!

               He slams the intercom:

                                     MILLER
                         All hands. Dr. Weir is missing. I 
                         want him found and restrained.

               Starck gathers all the files and disks. Shuts down the

               Peters follows Smith down the First Containment towards the 
               Main Access Corridor, carrying the last case of scrubbers. 
               She begins to lag behind.

               A GIGGLE echoes down the First Containment.

                                     PETERS
                              (whisper)
                         Denny?

               She turns back to the Second Containment...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT POV PETERS

               A SMALL FIGURE dashes through the darkness in the Second 
               Containment. Denny...?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

                                     PETERS
                         Smith.

               Peters turns, but Smith is already out of sight. She 
               hesitates. Moves back towards Second Containment.

               Again, Peters hears the GIGGLE of a child. The SCRAPE of 
               metal on metal. She slowly moves forward...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               ...into the darkness of the Second Containment. Peters sees 
               an open access panel. She looks inside.

               PETERS' POV - ACCESS DUCT

               A narrow tube, vanishing into darkness. A YOUNG CHILD'S VOICE 
               echoes from far away:

                                     DENNY (O.S.)
                         Mommy...

               PETERS

               ducks her head and enters the access duct.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny...?

               Miller sits at Justin's engineering position. Flips a series 
               of switches...

               Cooper works on the patch as the ship's running lights come 
               on in sequence...

               The bridge lights flicker, illuminate...

                         Now what?

                         She was right behind me, I turn 
                         around, she's gone. She could be 
                         anywhere.

                                     MILLER
                         Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. 
                         I'll find her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT

               Peters moves through the duct. Reaches a junction. Anything 
               could be with her, there in the dark.

               A child's WHISPER, too faint for words. Peters turns...

               Behind her, FOREGROUND, a YOUNG CHILD dashes across the 
               corridor.

               Peters turns back. Too late to see. Again, the child's WHISPER 
               draws her onward.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny? Denny, come to Mommy...

               FAINT LAUGHTER is her only answer. She follows the sound, 
               now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and 
               higher...

                                     PETERS
                         Hold on, Denny, Mommy's coming...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - DENNY'S DUCT - CATWALK

               Peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk 
               that snakes between huge oily machinery, just in time to 
               see...

               A SMALL CHILD running, disappearing into the gloom ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny?

               She runs forward into a junction. The lights flicker red.

                                     PETERS
                         Denny...?

                                     DENNY
                         Mommy...

               Her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead.

                                     PETERS
                         You can walk... Denny, you can walk... 
                         oh, my baby...

                                     DENNY
                         Wanna show you, Mommy, wanna show 
                         you something...

               He reaches his arms out to her...

               Peters steps forward, reaching for her son...

               ...falling into an open access hatch, hidden in the dark...

               INT. DENNY'S DUCT - (VERTICAL TUBE)

               ...a twenty meter drop...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Peters hits hard, lies before the Core, an offering of flesh 
               and blood. Her legs twist beneath her, shattered; blood pools 
               around her head. Her chest heaves: still alive.

                                     PETERS

               Denny peers down from the top of the shaft and GIGGLES. CLAPS 
               his hands in childlike glee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Weir wanders into First Containment, brooding.

                                     WEIR
                              (to himself)
                         I won't. I won't leave. This is my 
                         ship.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Weir enters the Second Containment. Freezes as he sees...

               Peters body lying twisted and broken before the Core.

                                     WEIR
                         Oh no. Peters...?

               He rushes to Peters. Reaches out to touch her but pulls his 
               hand back. Her eyes are black, eight-ball hemorrhage darkening 
               the irises. She is dead.

                                     WEIR
                         Why did you do that? You didn't have 
                         to do that...

                                     CLAIRE (O.S.)
                         Billy.

               Weir looks up from Peters' corpse.

               CLAIRE stands before the Core. She is naked. Her skin is 
               pale and beautiful and cold and wet. Her hair hangs in her 
               face, covering her milk-white eyes...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               Claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror. Behind her, 
               the tub steams...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT - (SEX AND SUICIDE 
               INTERCUT)

               Weir stares at Claire in shock. She walks to him. Slowly.

               She stops in front of him. Her arms hang at her sides. He 
               must reach for her.

               He does, putting his hands on her hips. He slides from his 
               chair to the floor to his knees. He presses his face to her 
               pale belly and cries. SOBS wrack his body...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...and in the bathroom, she clutches Weir's straight-razor...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               She reaches down. Slowly, her arms cradle his head. She slides 
               down on him. Straddles him.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...Claire slips into the steaming water...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               He raises his head to her breasts. His eyes, closed. She 
               remains unnaturally still, only her hips rocking back and 
               forth.

               Weir's mouth opens, GASPS as he enters her...

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...and the razor bites her skin...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               She caresses his face. Lifts his face to hers. Her mouth is 
               slack. Her hair hangs in front of her eyes.

               INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

               ...Claire floats dead in the red water, eyes open, hair 
               billowing around her head like a halo...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Weir gazes up at her, transfixed. He takes her hand and raises 
               it to his face. She caresses his cheek. And reaches for his 
               eyes...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               A MUFFLED SCREAM rips through the Second Containment Seal. 
               It begins as a human sound and ends as something else, an 
               alien CRY of rage.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

               The CRY echoes down the Main Corridor.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               DJ packs up blood samples. He raises his head at the sound 
               of the CRY.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Starck GASPS as the CRY resounds through the bridge.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller turns in the direction of the CRY. He begins to move 
               down the Corridor, towards the source.

                                     SMITH
                         Roger that.

               Smith carries another load of supplies. Movement out of the 
               corner of his eye...

               He turns in time to see Weir disappear around a corner inside 
               the Event Horizon.

                                     SMITH

               Miller jogs down the Main Corridor. An INTERCOM gets his

                         What is it, Smith?

                                     SMITH (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         I just saw Weir, I think he was 
                         messing around on the Clark.

               Something SPARKS and SIZZLES in the dim light, catching 
               Miller's eye. He looks up...

               One of the EXPLOSIVE CHARGES has been removed from the its 
               mounting in the Corridor.

                                     MILLER
                         Smith, get out of there...

                         One of the explosives is missing 
                         from the corridor. I think Weir may 
                         have put it on the Clark.

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK

               Smith's eyes open wide.

                              (intercom)
                         Get off the Clark now and wait for 
                         me at the airlock.

                                     SMITH
                         No, no, we just got her back 
                         together...

               Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards 
               his ship...

               INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS

               A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the 
               sound to a storage compartment. Rifles through it.

                                     SMITH
                         I gotcha... I gotcha...

               The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together.

               Smith grabs a duffel.

                                     SMITH
                         I gotcha.

               Opens it. He sees the EXPLOSIVE CHARGE from the Event Horizon 
               even as the BEEPS become a steady TONE. He closes his eyes 
               and SIGHS...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks 
               him back.

                                     MILLER
                         NOOO!

               Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing 
               loss of pressure.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL

               The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two 
               pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event 
               Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between 
               them.

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

               Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event 
               Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED 
               BREATHING is the only sound.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the 
               wreckage of his ship, spiralling away. He hits the intercom 
               with his forearm.

                                     MILLER
                         DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper 
                         are dead.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

                                     DJ
                         What happened?

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Weir. He used one of the explosives 
                         from the Corridor.

               The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns...

               Face to face with Weir...

               Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes. 
               Only clotted, empty sockets.

               DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat, 
               cutting him off.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

                                     MILLER
                         DJ, you read me?

               DJ does not answer. The CRASH of glass and steel resonates 
               over the intercom.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless 
               steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue...

               ...then something WET... and the struggle stops.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         DJ? DJ, come in...

               Finally, Weir emerges from the gloom. He searches among the 
               surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a 
               needle... and thread...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED 
               UMBILICUS)

               Miller, at the intercom. He tries another channel.

                                     MILLER
                         Peters...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               Peters body lies before the Core. The intercom CRACKLES.

                                     MILLER (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         Peters, are you there?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS)

                                     MILLER
                              (growing panic)
                         Starck, do you read me? Starck...?

               But it is Weir who answers. His voice sounds thick, choked 
               with dirt.

                                     WEIR (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         I told you... She won't let you 
                         leave...

                                     MILLER
                         Son of a bitch!

               Miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero-G tool. Lifts 
               a nailgun. Chambers a round.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION

               Cooper watches the Event Horizon fall farther and farther 
               away.

               He checks his oxygen gauge. One tank full, one tank at half.

               Cooper twists his backpack around, giving him access to the 
               oxygen tanks. He seals off his primary hose and disconnects 
               the full tank. His gauge immediately goes to "Yellow - 
               Reserve."

               Cooper points the full tank away from the Event Horizon and 
               OPENS IT...

               The blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship, 
               leaving the wreckage of the Lewis and Clark behind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Miller races through the corridors to Medical...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE

               ...and finds DJ, suspended above the table, neatly dissected. 
               His organs have been laid out carefully before him on the 
               steel table.

                                     MILLER
                         Oh my God.

               DJ raises his head.

                                     DJ
                              (whisper)
                         Please...

                                     MILLER
                         Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do 
                         I...

                                     DJ
                         Please... kill...

                                     MILLER
                         Oh God...

               Miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands. FIRES.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Miller approaches the door to the Bridge. It is open...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller stands in the doorway. A figure sits at the helm. 
               Miller aims the nailgun.

                                     MILLER
                         Weir.

               The figure doesn't move. Miller slowly circles around the 
               helm...

               It's Starck. Bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose, 
               unconscious.

                                     MILLER
                         Hold on... Get you outta these...

               Miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens 
               the cords. She BREATHES in ragged gasps, opens his eyes...

               Then stops. She stares over Miller's shoulder like a deer 
               caught in the headlights.

               Miller looks behind him...

               WEIR STANDS THERE, STARING WITH EYES SEWN SHUT.

               Miller reaches for the gun...

               Weir hits him, sending Miller across the bridge into a 
               bulkhead. Weir picks up the nailgun, examines it.

               Miller slowly gets to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         Your eyes...

                                     WEIR
                         I don't need them anymore. Where 
                         we're going, we won't need eyes to 
                         see.

                                     MILLER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     WEIR
                         Do you know what a singularity is, 
                         Miller? Does your mind truly fathom 
                         what a black hole is?
                              (beat)
                         It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal 
                         NOTHING. And if God is Everything, 
                         then I have seen the Devil.
                              (a dead man's grin)
                         It's a liberating experience.

               With his free hand, Weir reaches for the navigation console. 
               Flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE (ENLARGED CONSOLE)

               The display lights up.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Gravity drive primed. Do you wish to 
                         engage?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

                                     MILLER
                         What are you doing?

               Weir grins as he flips the final switch.

                                     COMPUTER
                         Gravity drive engaged. Activation in 
                         T-minus ten minutes.

               Miller lunges for the nailgun. Weir raises the nailgun to 
               point at Miller's face. Miller slowly backs away.

                                     MILLER
                         If you miss me, you'll blow out the 
                         hull. You'll die too.

                                     WEIR
                         What makes you think I'll miss?

               Miller sees something out of the corner of his eye...

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Cooper. Outside, braced in the viewport bracket.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Weir spins and FIRES at Cooper. The nail lodges in the thick 
               quartz glass. A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, 
               the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.

               Weir takes a step towards the window, raises the gun to fire 
               again.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               Miller dives for the door. Before Weir can fire,

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE WINDOW (HANGING SECTION)

               the window EXPLODES outward.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - BRIDGE

               The ship HOWLS as air rushes out, ripping Weir off his feet. 
               Weir catches himself in the broken window, trying to pull 
               himself back in...

               A monitor tears free, SMASHES into him. HE IS SUCKED OUT.

               Miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut. 
               He is safe...

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me!

               Miller turns. Starck clings to a console, barely able to 
               resist the winds that try to suck her into the void.

                                     STARCK
                              (gasping for air)
                         Please... help, help me...

               Miller hesitates, looking from Starck back into the safety 
               of the ship. The door continues to shut. In seconds, he will 
               be safe. And she will be dead.

               Miller YELLS and rips a compressor from its mount, wedges it 
               in the door to keep it open. He keeps one hand on the door, 
               reaches the other hand to Starck.

                                     MILLER
                         Give me your hand! Your hand!

               She does. Frost forms on their bodies as the air cools. Their 
               veins begin to bulge, blood pulses from their noses. He YELLS 
               with exertion...

               ...drags her to the door... through the door...

               ...as the compressor tears free, sucked into space...

               ...and the door SNAPS shut, missing them by a fraction.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE

               Starck and Miller collapse against the door. A moment passes 
               between them. Just happy to be breathing...

               ...and then the AIRLOCK KLAXON goes off.

                                     MILLER
                         The forward airlock.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GENERIC CORRIDOR

               Starck and Miller race towards the Forward Airlock Bay.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FORWARD AIRLOCK BAY NO. 4

               They enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light 
               of the airlock.

                                     STARCK
                         Weir can't be alive.

                                     MILLER
                         Whatever was on that bridge wasn't 
                         Weir.

               Miller looks around for a weapon. Pulls a zero-G bolt cutter 
               from the wall. Wields it like a bat.

                                     MILLER
                         Stay behind me.

               The inner airlock door releases with a HISS. Swings open...

               Cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.

                                     STARCK
                         Cooper!

               Starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off.

               He SUCKS air in, COUGHS it out.

                                     COOPER
                         Let me breathe, let me breathe...

                                     STARCK
                         You're okay now, it's over...

                                     MILLER
                              (sees something)
                         It's not over. It's just starting.

               Starck follows Miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing 
               display: GRAVITY DRIVE ENGAGED. ACTIVATION 00:06:43:01...

                                     MILLER
                         Weir activated the drive. He's sending 
                         us to the Other Place.

                                     STARCK
                         We've got to shut it down, we've got 
                         to...

                                     COOPER
                         How? The Bridge is gone.

                         There must be a way! What about 
                         Engineering?

                                     COOPER
                         Can you shut it down?

                                     STARCK
                         I don't know the process, Dr. Weir 
                         was the expert...

                                     COOPER
                         I don't want to go where the last 
                         crew went. I'd rather be dead.

                                     MILLER
                         BLOW THE FUCKER UP.

                                     STARCK
                         Blow it up?

                                     MILLER
                         We blow the Corridor. Use the 
                         foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it 
                         from the rest of the ship. We stay 
                         put...

                                     COOPER
                         ...and the gravity drive goes where 
                         no man has gone before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

                                     MILLER
                         You prep the gravity couches. I'm 
                         going to manually arm those 
                         explosives.

                                     COOPER
                         Will it work?

                                     MILLER
                         It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.

               Cooper nods, heads for the gravity couch bay. Starck follows 
               Miller to the steel pressure door.

                                     STARCK
                         I'll do it --

                                     MILLER
                         No. I'll be right back.

               Miller opens the door.

                                     MILLER
                         Close it behind me. Just in case.

               Beat. Starck stares at Miller as if memorizing his face.

                                     STARCK
                         Don't be long.

               Miller smiles wanly. The door slides shut with a dull THUNK.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Miller runs down the corridor. Stops at a bulkhead coupling. 
               Kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge, 
               switch it to MANUAL detonation.

               Miller runs to the next coupling. Repeats the process...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck and Cooper check the gravity couches. One by one, 
               they slide open...

                                     COOPER
                         I'm gonna activate the emergency 
                         beacon.

                                     STARCK
                         Hurry.

               Cooper exits down a ladder. Starck turns to the console, 
               activates three gravity couches. Behind her, two begin to 
               fill with blue gel...

               ...and one begins to fill with blood... the hint of dark 
               shapes moving within...

               Starck doesn't see it, concentrates on the console.

               THUMP. THUMP. Starck turns. Sees the bloody tank. Sees 
               something moving inside it.

               She slowly crosses to the tank. Peers at it...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY (TANK)

               THUMP. A FACE PRESSES AGAINST THE GLASS, STARING BACK AT 
               HER. WEIR. Bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasn't 
               finished forming.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               Starck SCREAMS and backs away.

                                     STARCK
                         Cooper...!

               The glass BURSTS in an EXPLOSION OF BLOOD...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR BELOW GRAVITY COUCH BAY

               A corridor beneath the Gravity Couch Bay. Cooper searches 
               through circuit panels until he finds the EMERGENCY BEACON 
               breaker. He runs a by-pass, activating it manually. The lights 
               begins to STROBE...

               DRIP. DRIP. A bloodstain spreads over his shoulder. He follows 
               the drip to the ceiling...

                                     COOPER
                         Starck?

               No response. He slowly moves to peer up the ladder...

               ...as Starck CRASHES down, bloody but alive.

                                     COOPER
                         What...?

                                     STARCK
                         Run!

               She shoves him away...

               Weir appears at the top of the ladder, crawling down headfirst 
               like a spider...

               Starck gets to her feet, staggers away...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST 
               CONTAINTMENT

               Miller kneels, removing the cover from the last explosive. 
               Flips a switch.

               A small cover pops open. Miller reaches in, removes a RADIO 
               DETONATOR.

               He arms the explosives. Watches the red lights on the 
               explosives wink on in the darkness.

               He reaches for an intercom.

                                     MILLER
                         We're armed. This fucker's ready to 
                         blow...

                         Miller, he's back, he was in the 
                         tank...

                         Slow down, Starck, I can't understand 
                         you, who was in the tank?

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               A figure seems to coalesce from the shadows behind Miller.

                                     STARCK (O.S.)
                              (intercom)
                         You have to get back here now, he's 
                         out there now, if he finds you...

               The figure moves forward into the light... Arcane runes etch 
               Weir's face; his eyes, now restored, blaze with unholy zeal.

                         He's dead...

               Miller glances over his shoulder. His jaw drops in surprise 
               as he sees...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Weir grinning at him... then SMASHES the intercom with his 
               fist, cutting off Starck's VOICE.

               Miller backs away.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               Weir stands between Miller and safety.

                                     WEIR
                         Weir is dead.

                                     MILLER
                         Then who the fuck are you?

                                     WEIR
                         Your fear. Do you remember the

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               FLAMES SPREAD OVER WEIR'S BODY, TRANSFORMING HIM INTO THE 
               BURNING MAN.

                                     BURNING MAN
                         Do you remember me?

                                     MILLER
                         That's not true...

                                     BURNING MAN
                         I begged you. I begged you to save 
                         me and you did nothing. You stood 
                         there and watched me burn...

                         SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

               The Burning Man YELLS and raises his arm in accusation...

               ...and FIRE RACES OUT FROM BEHIND HIM, flowing over the walls, 
               the ceiling, the floor, racing for Miller like a rising 
               tide...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - BY FIRST 
               CONTAINMENT

               Miller runs. Dead ahead, the First Containment...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - FIRST CONTAINMENT

               Miller runs fast. The fire is faster, flooding in behind 
               him.

               Miller dashes for the Second Seal as IT BEGINS TO CLOSE. The 
               fire gains on him, surrounding him.

               Miller dives through the Second Seal...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               ...barely makes it...

               ...SLAMS into the engineering console. Miller looks back at 
               the Second Seal. It's still open by a fraction when the fire 
               hits it...

               ...SENDING A LANCE OF FLAME stabbing out towards Miller. He 
               rolls aside as the fire hits the console. The console 
               EXPLODES.

               The Second Seal shuts tight, cutting the fire off. The paint 
               on the Second Seal begins to bubble and scorch... and then 
               cools as the fire subsides.

               Miller gets to his feet. Almost allows himself to relax. 
               Then he sees his shadow before him, dancing in the growing 
               red light. He turns...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

               The Second Containment is a holocaust. Fire swarms over the 
               walls. Burning jelly drips from Control Spikes. The Core 
               itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows 
               red-hot.

               Miller stares at the blazing Core.

                                     BURNING MAN (O.S.)
                         Don't leave me!

               Miller turns. The Burning Man stands RIGHT BESIDE HIM.

               He SMASHES Miller with a backhand that ignites Miller's 
               clothes and sends him flying. The detonator falls from 
               Miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. Miller 
               comes up CHOKING and SPLUTTERING.

               The Burning Man stalks towards Miller. The coolant STEAMS 
               and SIZZLES at his feet.

               Miller stares at the Burning Man as he approaches. Slowly 
               rises to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         You're not Edmund Corrick.

               The Burning Man's flames wane, revealing Weir's misshapen 
               form.

               Miller throws a wicked right. Weir catches Miller's fist. 
               SQUEEZES until blood wells up between his fingers. Then slings 
               Miller against a cooling tank with BONE CRACKING force. Miller 
               collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to 
               breathe.

               Weir slowly approaches.

                                     MILLER
                         What are you?

                                     WEIR
                         You know.

                                     MILLER
                         You want me to believe you're the 
                         Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not the Devil.

                                     MILLER
                         Then what, what are you? Tell me...

                                     WEIR
                         Better if I just show you.

               Weir's hands reach down and he grabs Miller by the skull. 
               Miller GASPS as he sees...

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT (VISIONS FROM HELL)

               Justin, Starck and Cooper, crucified upside-down upon the 
               Third Seal...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - SECOND CONTAINMENT

                                     MILLER
                         NO!

               His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weir's 
               head. Weir reels back, stunned.

               Miller gets to his feet.

                                     MILLER
                         You can't have them!

               He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull, 
               filling the runes on his face.

               Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again...

               This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears 
               it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a 
               single blow. Miller GROANS.

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much 
                         older. I watched the Beginning and I 
                         will see the End. I am the dark behind 
                         the stars. I am the dark inside you 
                         all.

               Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.

                                     MILLER
                         ...not the Devil...

               Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant, 
               comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise, 
               collapses back into the sludge.

               Weir slowly stalks towards him.

                                     WEIR
                         There is no Devil. There is no God. 
                         There is only... NOTHING.

                                     MILLER
                         You're lying...!

                                     WEIR
                         I'm not asking you to believe me. 
                         You'll see for yourself... and so 
                         will your crew. You're all coming 
                         with me.

                                     MILLER
                         Starck... Cooper...

               Weir's grotesque face is inches from his. He reaches down 
               and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze...

                                     WEIR
                         They are mine. And so are you...

               ...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his 
               fist.

               Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face...

               ...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.

                                     MILLER
                              (a grim smile of 
                              triumph)
                         You can't have them. Go to hell.

                                     WEIR
                         NOOO!

               MILLER DEPRESSES THE DETONATOR.

               EXT. EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

               A small, silent EXPLOSION blossoms in the aft section of the 
               ship...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

               ...followed frames later by a sequence of DETONATIONS that 
               rip the Main Access Corridor apart and propel the foredecks 
               away from the containment section.

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

               The EXPLOSION knocks Starck and Cooper down. They hold on 
               tightly as...

               Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizon's

               A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as 
               the gateway opens... A BLACK HOLE...

               The black hole begins to shrink, imploding. As it collapses, 
               it sucks Neptune's blue clouds with it, creating a TITANIC 
               WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center...

               The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the 
               whirlpool, towards the black hole...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

               Cooper and Starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at 
               a terrific angle...

               The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion...

               The black hole collapses utterly, vanishing to a point. An 
               enormous SHOCKWAVE rips out from the point of implosion.

               The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out 
               of Neptune's atmosphere to safety...

               INT. EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR WINDOW

               The VIBRATIONS subside. Cooper and Starck stagger to their 
               feet. Look out the window...

               EXT. NEPTUNE - MODEL COOPER/STARCK POV

               Neptune recedes, the ugly hole of the implosion already being

               Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her.

Scene #12, Interior, Day, Dining Room










1    ED - W


     Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
     tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of
     view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view
     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small
     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by
     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.



2    ED - CAR


     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of
     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be
     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving
     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a
     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.



3    ID - CAR


     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY
     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.
     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts,
     and are students along with the others at that univer-
     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen
     to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the
     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
     were a drum.


                             SHELLY

               (Singing with the music)... Together,
               forever...


                             SCOTT

               Ash, where are we?


                             ASHLY

               I'll tell ya in a second. Now we're
               still on seventy-five just past the
               county border...



4    ED - W


     Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the
     dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
     to peer downward. Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
     mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.



5    ID - CAR


     ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Which would put us...which would
               put us...


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ, just tell us already
               will ya?


     ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


     SCOTT is growing impatient.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


                             SCOTT

               Yes?


                             ASHLY

               Here!


     Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks
     from SCOTT's hand.



6    ED - CAR


     The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane.
     A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming
     races toward the car on a collision coarse.



7    ID - CAR


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, watch out!



8    ED - CAR


     The truck races closer.



9    ID - CAR


     Their steering wheel is locked.


                             ASHLY

               Turn!



10   ED - CAR


     At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can
     be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its
     own lane.



11   ED - CAR


     The truck speeds harmlessly past them.



12   ID - CAR


                             ASHLY

               Damn it Scott, what the hell was that?
               You trying to kill us?


                             SCOTT

               Don't yell at me, it's your lousy
               steering wheel. The damn thing jerked
               right out of my hand.


                             ASHLY

               I can't understand it. I just had
               this thing in for a tune-up.


                             SHELLY

               Radio's dead too, ace.


                             ASHLY

               And I just had 'em tune up the whole
               thing yesterday.


                             SCOTT

               Well, then take it back 'cause the
               damn thing don't work. Only thing
               that works on the whole car is the
               lousy horn.


     SCOTT honks the horn.



13   ED - CAR


     Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to
     the horn by waving.



14   ID - CAR


     SCOTT yells out the window at them.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, go to hell, I'm not waving at ya!


     He looks in the rear view mirror. The MEN are still wav-
     ing in the distance. SCOTT turns back to drive.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     SHELLY turns around in the front seat and holds up a
     pint of Scotch.


                             SHELLY

               Well, I'd like to make a toast. To
               Scott who almost killed us.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, eat shit and die will ya?


     SHELLY and the others laugh.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end
               in a wonderful cabin with good friends,
               (She glances at SCOTT) provided we
               live that long.


     SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
     back to ASHLY and LINDA. ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.


                         ASHLY and LINDA

               ...With good friends.


     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY
     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes
     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite "No,
     thank you," then back up front to SCOTT.


                             LINDA

               Hey Scotty, what's this place like
               anyway?


                             SCOTT

               Well, the guy that's renting it says
               it's an old place, little run down,
               but it's right up in the mountains-
               totally secluded. (He takes a drink
               from the bottle) Best part is, we
               get it so cheap.


                             LINDA

               Why are we getting it so cheap?


                             SCOTT

               I don't know, might be in real bad
               shape.


                             CHERYL

               You mean nobody's seen this place
               yet?


                             SCOTT

               Not yet.


                             ASHLY

               Might not be too bad.


                             LINDA

               No...


                             ASHLY

               Actually, it might be very nice.


                             LINDA

               Yeah...


                             SHELLY

               It's probably a real pit.


                             CHERYL

               I can't believe that we're renting
               a place for a week-end that nobody's
               seen.


                             SCOTT

               (Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ,
               not this again...


                             CHERYL

               (Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and
               dad would never let us go up to a place
               like this if they knew-


                             ASHLY

               -Which is exactly why they don't know.
               I'll tell you who I am gonna call.
               The guys that fixed up this car.



15   ED - CAR


     The car approaches an exit along the highway.



16   ID - CAR


     ASHLY glances at the map again.


                             ASHLY

               Hey, I think this is where we get
               off.



17   ED - CAR


     The car turns off the main highway and follows several
     back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that
     winds upward along a twin set of mountains.



18   ID - CAR


     SCOTT glances up to the peaks.


                             SCOTT

               These mountains seem familiar.


                             LINDA

               What do they remind you of? Some-
               thing majestic? Adventure?


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, more like adventure.


                             LINDA

               Any adventure in particular?


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's sweater.


     ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly,
     and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself.


                             SHELLY

               (Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it
               Scotty, when you least expect it,
               you're gonna get it good.



19   ED - B


     Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending
     over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses.



20   ED - CAB


     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-
     ues to sputter and backfire.



21   ID - CAR


     ASHLY reacts to his car.


                             ASHLY

               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.
               but I'm just not paying for it.


                             LINDA

               This place is perfect.


                             CHERYL

               The woods come awfully close to the
               house don't they?


                             SCOTT

               So what's wrong with the woods, they
               can't bite ya.


                             CHERYL

               It's just a little claustrophobic
               that's all.


                             LINDA

               Well, I think it's beautiful.


                             SHELLY

               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-
               end.



22   ED - CAB


     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.


                             SCOTT

               It's supposed to be one of these on
               here.


     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.



23   ID - M.R.


     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT
     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.
     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings
     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,
     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently
     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door
     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap
     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, this place has a dungeon.


     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over
     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing
     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
     to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Put these back will you?


     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the
     hatch but cannot.


                             SCOTT

               They nailed it shut.


                             CHERYL

               Good, I don't like cellars. Probably
               just some garbage down there anyways.


                             SCOTT

               Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in
               cellars. I mean it's not going to
               try and get out or anything.


                             CHERYL

               Well, what's down there?


                             SCOTT

               Well, could be any number of things.
               Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead
               bodies-


                             LINDA

               Hey, look at this!


     LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
     father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it
     begins to tick.


                             LINDA

               Ta daaaaaa!


     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.



24   ET - CAB


     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.



25   IT - M.R.


     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She
     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the
     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil
     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-
     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-
     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can
     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-
     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the
     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale
     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.
     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some
     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch
     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open
     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale
     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks
     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some
     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.
     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping
     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns
     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-
     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.
     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from
     the cellar.



26   IT - K/M.R.


     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-
     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between
     her and the trap door.


                             ASHLY

               What're you drawing Cheryl?


     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his
     shoulder to glance at it.


                             CHERYL

               I...I don't know.


                             ASHLY

               Is it a bible?


                             CHERYL

               No, no it's no bible. (She glances
               again at the cellar, knowing some-
               thing is down there) I don't know
               what it is.


                             LINDA

               Well, this one of the clock's not
               bad.


     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to
     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She
     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL
     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
     of her to speak secretly.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) I got it right here.


     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking
     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's
     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.
     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, this is really good. I like
               how you did the numbers in that wood-
               ish style.


     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on
     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She
     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although
     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with
     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.


                             ASHLY

               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd
               like it.


     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his
     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
     on CHERYL's small drawing table.


                             LINDA

               It's really good Cheryl. Very close
               to the origional.


                             CHERYL

               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very
               close.


                             LINDA

               I'm gonna check dinner.


     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.


                             ASHLY

               You better get washed up. I'll see
               ya in there.


     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL
     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of
     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-
     ing...waiting.



27   IT - K


     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.
     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.



28   IT - D.R.


     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA
     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the
               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...


                             CHERYL

               Will you stop it?


                             LINDA

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.


                             SCOTT

               Will you relax, I'm just kidding
               around. She can take a joke-


     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He
     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in
     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,
     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.


     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.


                             SCOTT

               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.


     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.


                             ASHLY

               I'd like to make a toast for all
               here this evening. As a greek friend
               of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert-
               dis-ruben-tu-tar-im."


                             LINDA

               Which means?


                             SCOTT

               Party down!


     The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of
     wood heard from the main room.


                             SCOTT

               What the hell...


     All stand from the table and hurry to the main room.



29   IN - M.R.


     The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
     out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open.
     They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to
     what could have done this. CHERYL is slighly more nervous
     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.


                             ASHLY

               (Slowly) What is this?


                             SCOTT

               Whatever it is, it's still down there.


                             CHERYL

               I don't like cellars, let's close it
               up. (She does not want to deal with
               it) It's probably just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
               that's the stupidest thing I ever
               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.


     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He
     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.


                             LINDA

               Maybe it is just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, probably right. It's probably
               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why
               don't you make sure.


     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
     back.


                             CHERYL

               Scotty, I'm not going down there!


                             SCOTT

               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.


                             LINDA

               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you
               go down there. Why don't you wait
               until morning.


                             SCOTT

               Look, I'll be all right.


                             SHELLY

               What melodrama! What courage! A kiss
               my brave hero.


     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends
     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.


                             SHELLY

               I, your virgin queen eagerly await
               the precious moment when you will
               ascend.


                             SCOTT

               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and
     ASHLY wait above.


                             ASHLY

               (Calling down) Hey Scott, see any-
               thing?


     There is no answer.


                             ASHLY

               Hey Scott!...Scott!


                             SHELLY

               He's just kidding around.


     There is silence.


                             SHELLY

               Isn't he?


     No sounds come from the cellar.


                             ASHLY

               Linda, get me a flashlight.


                             LINDA
               That's the only one we brought up.


     ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.


                             ASHLY

               Then get that lantern.


     LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,
     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.



30   IN - C


     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In
     front of him stands an old door which leads to another
     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.
     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with
     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the
     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his
     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.


                             ASHLY

               Scott?


     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into
     a pair of arms which grab him.


                             ASHLY

               Ahhhhhhh!


     It is only SCOTT behind him.


                             ASHLY

               What the hell are you doing down
               here, jerkin' off? How come you
               didn't answer me?


                             SCOTT

               When?


                             ASHLY

               Just now, I mean upstairs.


                             SCOTT

               I didn't hear you.


                             ASHLY

               Oh well, did you find anything?


                             SCOTT

               Uh-uh.


                             ASHLY

               What's this?


     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,
     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the
     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover
     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and
     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.



31   EN - CAB


     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.



32   IN - M.R.


     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed
     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once
     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man
     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.


                             ASHLY

               Shhh, listen to this.


                             VOICE

               My name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro-
               fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology
               in Dextin university's ancient history
               department...


                             ASHLY

               This is the tape I found downstairs.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...I am recording this
               entry from a small cabin in the south-
               ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am
               staying with my wife for a few weeks
               so that I may continue my research un-
               disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-
               iate professors and myself have been
               excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I
               believe I have made an important find
               in that area, and thus the reason for
               this log. With it, I can keep an ac-
               curate record of translations from
               my latest find; the first of six, the
               others still lost, volumes of ancient
               Sumarian burial practices and rites.
               Basically, it is a book of do's and
               don'ts dealing with the deceased en-
               titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans-
               lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound
               in human flesh, and inked with blood
               of the deceased...


                             SCOTT

               Jeez, I'd hate to find out what they
               used for pens.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...This particular volume
               deals with demons and demon resurrect-
               ion. These are of the Katardi family,
               meaning those forces believed to inhab-
               it the jungles and woods of man's do-
               main. The first few pages that I have
               translated warn that these demons are
               dangerous, everpresent, and exist
               primarily through this book. As legend
               has it, only the sacred high priests
               of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess
               these books, for they alone could
               properly control the resurrected de-
               mons. It is only through the act of
               reciting the resurrection passage
               that these demons would be able to
               posess the living. For many years, it
               was thought that this legend-


     CHERYL turns off the machine at this point.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, what'd you do that for? It was
               just getting good.


                             CHERYL

               I just don't want to hear any more
               that's all.


                             SCOTT

               (Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's
               scared.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for
     a bit then stops.


                             SCOTT

               She's acting like a baby- it's no
               big deal.


     He turns the machine on. The passage continues.

     A section of ground deep within the woods begins to crack,

               (Louder now) Shut it off.


     ASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the
     window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear.

               Kanda!

     A bolt of lightning strikes very near and its thunder

     CHERYL can no longer control herself. She screams and
     covers her ears.


                             CHERYL

               Shut it offffff!


     The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree
     tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and
     turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room.
     ASHLY turns to SCOTT.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, you knew not to play it, I
               mean...I mean you knew it was upset-
               ting her. You just don't know when
               you're carrying something too far.


                             SCOTT

               (To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY)
               Big deal, it's just a joke, shit.


     SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles
     to himself along the way.


                             SCOTT

               You'd think she's three years old or
               something.


     SCOTT slams the door behind him. ASHLY sighs. He moves
     to the broken window and reaches through it to close
     the outside shutters.


                             LINDA

               He's really been bothering you hasn't
               he?


     ASHLY walks to a chair near the other window.


                             ASHLY

               No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay.
               It's just that ever since we came
               up here, things have been a little
               too tense. (He sits) All these crazy
               things going on. And look at that
               window- we're gonna have to pay for
               that window now.


                             LINDA

               It'll be better tomorrow. Things'll
               smooth out, you'll see.


                             ASHLY

               I hope so.


     He looks at LINDA lovingly for a long moment.


                             ASHLY

               What'ya say we stay up for a while
               and listen to the storm.


                             LINDA

               Deal. Lemme check on Cheryl. I'll be
               right back.


     From across the room, she is seen opening CHERYL's door
     a crack. LINDA asks if she is all right, and gets a
     muffled reply. In the foreground, ASHLY removes the
     small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in
     his hand. He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's
     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the
     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens
     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are
     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA
     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again
     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,
     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping
     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box
     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again
     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.


                             LINDA

               Ah ha!


                             ASHLY

               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind
               eh? It's for you.


     LINDA begins to open the box.


                             LINDA

               It better be good.


     The gold necklace is revealed inside.


                             LINDA

               Oh Ash, it's beautiful.


     LINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box
     and holds it around her neck.


                             ASHLY

               (Fastening it around her neck) I was
               going to give it to you before we
               left, but things got so hectic, this
               is the first chance I've had. Do you
               like it?


     LINDA moves to a mirror.


                             LINDA

               It's beautiful. I really love it.
               (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take
               it off.

     Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the
     small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and
     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them
     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette
     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force
     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,
     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a
     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.
     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks
     at it, then out to the dark woods.



44   IN - C.B.


     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the
     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A
     noise almost like that of something breathing.



45   EN - CAB


     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL
     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be
     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind
     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering
     about.


                             CHERYL

               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody
               out there?


     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage
     toward the woods.



46   EN - W


     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.
     CHERYL stops.


                             CHERYL

               I know someone's out there...I
               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.


     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms
     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.
     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind
     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest
     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can
     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows
     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of
     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth
     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin
     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty
     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.
     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She
     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,
     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,
     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry
     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap
     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches
     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now
     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to
     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges
     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is
     still following.



47   EN - CAB


     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She
     begins pounding upon the door.


                             CHERYL

               Help, help, let me in. Open the door!


     The evil entity now emerges from the woods.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly! Linda! Open up!


     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where
     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-
     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but
     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer
     with each key.


                             CHERYL

               Please, someone please! Help me, help
               meeeee!


     The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are
     so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends
     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is
     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She
     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.



48   IN - M.R.


                             SCOTT

                             CHERYL

               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill
               me. I, I heard a noise and...and I
               ran and the trees...the trees!


                             SCOTT

               What are you-


     He is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl what's wrong with you? Did
               something in the woods do this to
               you?


                             CHERYL

               No, no, no...the woods themselves-
               The trees- they're alive...


     She hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs.


                             CHERYL

               They're alive...


                             LINDA

               Ash, why don't I take her into the
               bedroom so she can lie down a little-


                             CHERYL

               (Cutting her off) -I'm not lying
               down! I'm not staying here. We're
               leaving this place, we're leaving
               this place right now!


                             SCOTT

               Wait a minute, I'm sure as hell not
               going anywhere.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl-


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
               Trees do not attack people.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly, will you drive me into town
               or not?


                             ASHLY

               (Looking at his watch) Right Now?
               (He realizes how desperate she is)
               Sure, sure I'll drive you into town.
               But if you'll just listen to what
               you're saying, you-


                             CHERYL

               I don't care how it sounds. I want
               to leave this minute. You can bring
               back my things when you go.


                             ASHLY

               Okay- if you don't want to stay, I
               can't make you.


     LINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to
     the door.

     ASHLY and CHERYL move to the car. ASHLY helps CHERYL in

               I'll stay some place in town tonight.


     ASHLY tries to start the car. There is no response.
     CHERYL becomes somewhat worried. ASHLY tries again.
     The car will not turn over. A look of dread comes
     across CHERYL's face.



51   EN - CAB


     SCOTT and the others join the two outside.



52   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               It's not gonna start.


     ASHLY again tries the engine.


                             CHERYL

               I know it's not gonna start. It's
               not gonna let us leave.


     ASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time, start-
     ing up with a roar. ASHLY, worried by CHERYL's condition
     glances over to her. Confused and upset, CHERYL turns
     away from ASHLY and looks out her window. They drive off
     into the night through the wooded mountains toward town.
     ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest in-
     tensely for any sign of movement. The concern for his
     sister is made obvious by the expression on his face.
     Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows
     down.


                             CHERYL

               Why are you slowing down?


     ASHLY brings the car to a halt.


                             CHERYL

               What is this?


     ASHLY's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens
     slowly. He flips on the high beams which stab through the
     evening mist.

     The bridge over the chasm has been torn away. CHERYL is
     silent as ASHLY walks to the ravine's edge to examine
     any remains.

               no...it's not going to let us leave,
               it's not going to let us go...it's

     An axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash-
     ing upon a log, splitting it in two. SCOTT is chopping
     wood outside the cabin. Behind him, through a window,
     CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him.
     SCOTT sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves
     away. CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods
     beyond. The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past
     her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards
     on the floor. ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with
     the tape recorder in front of him. He plugs an earphone
     in so only he can hear it. SCOTT enters the cabin and
     passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side
     of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back
     outside.

     From inside, LINDA speaks.

               Cheryl, wanna play some cards?


                             CHERYL

               (Turning with a smile) Uh-uh.


     CHERYL turns to face the window again.


                             LINDA

               Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find
               some way around that cliff into town
               okay?


                             CHERYL

               Okay.


     Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights
     fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with
     the ear plug.


                             VOICE

               March 12th. Suzanne came after me
               and almost murdered me. My own wife.
               At first I thought it was a mental
               or physical disorder because of what
               had happened to her eyes, but I was
               only fooling myself. I knew what it
               was.


     Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather
     wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds
     up one in particular.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, guess this card.


                             LINDA

               How am I going to know what card
               that is?


                             SHELLY

               Guess, I'm going to see if you're
               psychic.


     The card is a two of clubs.


                             LINDA

               Okaaaay...is it a queen?


                             SHELLY

               Right!


                             LINDA

               Really?


                             SHELLY

               Yeah.


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, I guessed the card right.


                             ASHLY

               (indifferently) Truly amazing Linda.


     He is listening intently to the log as it continues.


                             VOICE

               Three days have passed since that
               thing has been down there. I was hop-
               ing to weaken it without food or
               water. Nothing worked. Finally, in
               desperation I dragged her out to the
               shed and dismembered her so that what-
               ever it was could not get up again.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl, did you see that?


     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the
     window.


                             SHELLY

               Try this one.


     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.


                             LINDA

               Okay, lemme think, uh...


     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-
     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.


                             LINDA

               ...Um, it's a seven.


                             SHELLY

               Oh my God, what suit?


                             LINDA

               Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts!


                             SHELLY

               That's right- seven of hearts!


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed
               two cards in a row.


                             ASHLY

               (Still not paying attention) How do
               you do it Linda?


     He is concentrating on the tape.


                             VOICE

               This is when I saw the dark figures
               moving about in the woods. I should
               have never tampered with the "Book
               Of The Dead." I now know that what-
               ever it is I have resurrected through
               this book, is coming for me.


                             LINDA

               You know, I always thought I had
               some sort of extra sense. You know,
               like e.s.p or something.


                             SHELLY

               What's this one?


     She holds up the queen of spades.


                             LINDA

               Another seven!


                             SHELLY

               I don't believe it!


                             CHERYL

               (Still looking outside) Queen of
               spades.


     SHELLY looks at her card then back to CHERYL. She holds
     up another card.


                             CHERYL

               Four of hearts.


     The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in
     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen
     in silence.


                             CHERYL

               Eight of spades.


     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.


                             CHERYL

               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-
               jack of clubs-


     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY
     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward
     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of
     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.
     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about
     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-
     like her own.


                             CHERYL

               Why have you disturbed our sleep,
               awakened us from our ancient slum-
               ber? You will die. Like the others
               before you. We will take you one by
               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the
     floor.


                             ASHLY

               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!


     SHELLY does not respond.


                             ASHLY

               Hurry!


     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL
     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but
     behind her, she reaches for a pen.


                             LINDA

               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.
               What's wrong with her?


     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.


                             SCOTT

               What happened to her?


     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.


                             LINDA

               Look at her eyes.


     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,
     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,
     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.
     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied
     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping
     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining
     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin
     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting
     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-
     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.
     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward
     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull
     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when
     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses
     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to
     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above
     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the
     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA
     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She
     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut
     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push
     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top
     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the
     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented
     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand
     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the
     chain across the hatch.



57   IN - LB


     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.
     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks
     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.



58   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in
     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and
     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's
     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her
     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.


                             SCOTT

               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a
               bad bump.


                             ASHLY

               (Quietly) Yeah.


     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below
     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.


                             ASHLY

               We've still got a few hours before
               morning.


                             SHELLY

               I don't know if I can wait that
               long.


                             SCOTT

               You have to. We all have to. Then,
               once it's light out, we'll try to
               find a way to get around that chasm.


                             SHELLY

               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep
               making those horrible noises?


                             ASHLY

               I don't know.


                             SHELLY

               And what about her eyes?


     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.


                             SHELLY

               What about her eyes? (Desperately)
               For God's sake what happened to
               her eyes?!


     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a
     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the
     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches
     and listens to what is said above. From her point of
     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be all right.


     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow
     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.



59   EN - CAB


     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves
     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs
     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil
     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin
     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves
     behind a bush.



60   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, I...I think there's some-
               thing out there.


     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.



61   EN - CAB


     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,
     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-
     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.



62   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.


                             SCOTT

               ...Is to get some rest. Ash and I
               can stay up with Cheryl.


                             SHELLY

               Okay.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be okay. Come
               morning- you'll see.


     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the
     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with
     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY
     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.
     It stands silent.



63   EN - CAB


     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees
     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.
     She begins to undress near the window. The force now
     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous
     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.
     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream
     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.



64   IN - M.R.


     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the
     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places
     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly, are you okay?


     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns
     to ASHLY.


                             SCOTT

               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.



65   IN - S.B.


     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing
     amidst the shadows.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows
     upon the curtains.



66   IN - S. BATH


     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the
     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT
     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the
     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.
     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's
     face and clothes with her nails.



67   IN - S.B.


     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY
     still upon him biting at his throat.



68   IN - M.R.


     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to
     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She
     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot
     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her
     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are
     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns
     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.


                             SHELLY

               Thank you. I don't know what I would
               have done if I had remained on the hot
               coals burning my pretty flesh. You
               have pretty skin- give it to us!


     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-
     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries
     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with
     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-
     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from
     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up
     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat
     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.
     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT
     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings
     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices
     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.
     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits
     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's
     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches
     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and
     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor
     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now
     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the
     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming
     the blade into her spine.

     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the
     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her
     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours
     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY
     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.
     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes
     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-
     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to
     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.


                             SCOTT

               Ahhhhhhh!


     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is
     dead.


                             ASHLY

               No...no...no...


                             SCOTT

               Hit her!


     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,
     and laughing madly.


                             SCOTT

               Hit it!


     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands
     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY
     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT
     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams
     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and
     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe
     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the
     final chop, there is silence.

     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-
     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and
     something must be done.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...Scott.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah.


                             ASHLY

               What is uh...what are we gonna do?


                             SCOTT

               Bury her.


                             ASHLY

               You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend
               of ours isn't she?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, she's dead.


     ASHLY moves away from SCOTT.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury
               her now.


     ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly.



69   EN - CAB


     Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near
     the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the
     task look very stark and barren.



70   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's
     room to check in on her.



71   IN - L.B.


     He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully.



72   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load-
     ing new batteries into a flashlight.


                             SCOTT

               I saw an old hiking trail when we
               were driving up here. Now I don't
               know if it goes all the way around
               that gorge-


                             ASHLY

               -Or if it's even still in tact.


                             SCOTT

               Or if it's even still in tact. But
               uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good
               care of Linda.


                             ASHLY

               I will. Do you have everything?


                             SCOTT

               (Putting on a small back pack) Yeah-
               all set.


                             ASHLY

               Listen...Scotty...I'm sorry about
               falling apart like that when-


                             SCOTT

               Don't bother, really.


     He steps out the door.


                             SCOTT

               If I find a way out of here, I'll
               mark it and then come back. Then if
               I'm not back here in a few hours...
               if for some reason...well, if I don't
               come back, grab Linda, leg and all,
               and just get her the hell out of here.


     They shake hands.


                             ASHLY

               You're a good man.


                             SCOTT

               Good, I'm the best.



73   EN - CAB


     ASHLY smiles a good-bye to SCOTT and watches him move
     off into the night. He lingers for a moment by SHELLY's
     grave, then slowly disappears into the woods.



74   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY closes the door and turns back to the main room.
     He sees CHERYL's eyes through the crack in the cellar.
     She has been watching all of this through a space be-
     tween the trap door and floor. ASHLY walks past her to
     LINDA's room.



75   IN - L.B.


     He opens the door and a crack of light falls across her.
     LINDA wakes up.


                             LINDA

               Who's there? Ash?


                             ASHLY

               It's me Linda.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I had a bad dream about Linda.


                             ASHLY

               You did baby?


                             LINDA

               Yeah. She's all right isn't she?


                             ASHLY

               Yeah. Fine.


                             LINDA

               Is Shelly okay too Ash?


     ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks
     in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's
               all.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I love you. (She turns over)


                             ASHLY

               Get some rest.


     ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few
     hours ago engulfs him once more.



76   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his
     tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks.


                             CHERYL

               You lied to her. You lied to Linda.
               Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead.
               Don't you know the difference? You
               killed her. You and Scott cut her up
               with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha-
               ha-ha-


     ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap
     door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then
     the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain
     securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again.


                             CHERYL

               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY takes the axe and steps outside.



77   EN - CAB


     He begins to chop wood, taking out his emotions upon
     the logs with each blow. SHELLY's blood can still be
     seen on the blade of the axe.



78   IN - M.R.


     From her dungeon, CHERYL watches ASHLY chop wood in the
     window. The shadow of his axe rising then striking is
     seen over her white eyes.



79   EN - CAB


     Exhausted, ASHLY puts down the axe. He looks off into
     the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT. He returns to
     the cabin.



80   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL begins her taunting again.


                             CHERYL

               Soon all of you will be like me and
               then who will lock you in the cellar?
               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap
     door. ASHLY walks by her to LINDA's room.



81   IN - L.B.


     She is still asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake her, ASHLY
     pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. He re-
     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does
     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-
     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still
     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with
     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets
     out a low growl.



82   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through
     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back
     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to
     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something
     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated
     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY
     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He
     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching
     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the
     couch so he can sit. SCOTT is in agony and can barely
     speak.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I
               can't feel my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay.
               You're gonna be just fine- you'll see.


     He throws another log on the fire.


                             ASHLY

               You'll see.


     He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone.
     She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where
     ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor-
     rible rasping sounds.

                             SCOTT

               It's, it's not gonna let us leave...
               Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're
               all gonna die here...


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die!


                             SCOTT

               ...All gonna die. All of us.


     ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently.


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die! We're not gonna
               die! We're getting out of here! Now
               listen to me- is there a way around
               the chasm.


     SCOTT passes out.


                             ASHLY

               Scotty. Scott!


     ASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Ash. I don't want to die. So...
               so lonely to die like this. You're not
               gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash?


                             CHERYL

               (Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to
               die. So lonely to die like this. You're
               not gonna leave me are you? Are you
               Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


                             ASHLY

               Scott, is there some way around the
               chasm?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I'm scared- I...I can't feel
               my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, listen to me please, for
               God's sake. Is there a way around
               the chasm?


                             SCOTT

               There is...one way, the trail...but
               the trees, they know...don't you see-
               they're alive!! They're ali-ahhhhhhh!


     His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain.
     Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over
     grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks
     to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.


                             ASHLY

               Shut up!


     She continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in
     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but
     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on
     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety
     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.


                             ASHLY

               God forgive me Linda.


     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It
     is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle.


                             LINDA

               Ash, oh Ash, help Me! Please.


     She hugs him tightly.


                             LINDA

               Don't let them take me away again,
               please, please, please.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and holding her tightly) I
               won't, I won't- I promise.


     CHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly? Ashly, help me. Let me out
               of here. I'm all right now.


     ASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar.
     LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace.


                             CHERYL

               I'm all right now, Ashly. I'm all
               right. Come unlock this chain and
               let me out.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     There is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through
     the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the
     chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something
     wrong, he stops.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-
     est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards
     and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand
     reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly
     it withdraws beneath the floor.


                             CHERYL

               (A little too sweet) Ash, what are you
               doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't
               you recognize me?


     Her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from
     the celler.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and yelling to the cellar)
               You bastards! Why are you doing this?
               Why?


     There is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him
     begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more,
     and she laughs at ASHLY.


                             ASHLY

               Oh...Linda.


     With newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by
     the legs and drags her outside.



83   EN - CAB


                             LINDA

               It's useless, useless, useless. In
               time we'll come for him, then you
               ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin,
     closing the door behind him.



84   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT is coughing again.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, Ash, please...I don't want to
               die- but...but I can't stand this
               pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something.
               Gimme something to put me out.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, I can't. I- I know it's bad.
               But I can't be alone now, I can't.
               I'd lose my mind.


                             SCOTT

               Please Ash, please.


                             ASHLY

               You'll get better- you'll see.


     LINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves
     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no
     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-
     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be
               better and we'll both get out of
               here tomorrow.


                             SCOTT

               There is no tomorrow! You- you've
               got to kill her and cut- cut her
               up- your sister too.


                             ASHLY

               No, that was only with Shelly. You
               had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves
               me. You're delirious- I...I'll get
               you some water.


     ASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips.


                             ASHLY

               Now, now the sun will be up in an
               hour or so and we'll get out of here
               ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly-
               n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go
               home together. Wouldn't you like to
               be going home? You'd like that I'd
               bet, wouldn't ya?


     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of
     his mouth.


                             ASHLY

               ...Scott.


     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY
     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There
     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the
     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting
     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs
     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.
     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs
     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against
     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled
     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and
     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm
     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY
     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-
     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The
     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.
     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in
     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.

     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of
     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,
     through the back door and out to the work shed.



85   IN - W.S.


     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body
     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails
     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the
     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves
     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a
     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks
     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He
     turns off the saw.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) Linda...


     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's
     body.



86   EN - CAB


     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the
     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.
     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.
     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create
     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's
     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of
     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel
     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.



87   IN - M.R.


     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists
     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants
     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to
     loosen.



88   EN - CAB


     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to
     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.



89   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the
     trap door in tact.



90   EN - CAB


     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on
     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up
     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied
     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she
     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out
     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's
     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large
     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs
     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him
     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY
     hits the ground with considerable force and for the
     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's
     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on
     the ground.


                             ASHLY

               Stay back.


     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA
     advances toward him, laughing.


                             ASHLY

               Linda please, if you can still hear
               me. Keep away.


     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,
     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the
     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into
     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-
     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from
     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.
     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace
     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
     staggers back to the cabin.



91   IN - M.R.


     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.


                             ASHLY

               Oh.....


     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open
     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.
     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the
     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.



92   IN - S.B.


     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs
     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward
     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only
     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of
     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.
     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL
     backs away and spots the open front door.


                             ASHLY

               The door...


     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.



93   IN - M.R.


     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.



94   EN - CAB


     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.



95   IN - MR


     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started
     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams
     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard
     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam
     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-
     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to
     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is
     his last shell.


                             ASHLY

               (To himself) More shells. Where did
               I see that box of shells?



96   IN - C


     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY
     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his
     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks
     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds
     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.
     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.



97   IN - M.R.


     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks
     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,
     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows
     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he
     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind
     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for
     something to happen. He is tense and more determined
     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.


                             ASHLY

               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why
               are you torturing me like this?

     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something
     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's
     necklace.


                             ASHLY

               ...Linda. (He whispers)


     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest
     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through
     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to
     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.
     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole
     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and
     fires at her head.



98   EN - CAB


     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL
     is jolted from the door.



99   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in
     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens
     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He
     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.
     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into
     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several
     steps, then continues after ASHLY.



100  EN - CAB


     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.



101  IN - M.R.


     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of
     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at
     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.
     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges
     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY
     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The
     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY
     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL
     breaks through the front door and begins to push the
     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-
     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and
     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and
     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its
     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and
     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from
     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto
     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives
     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent
     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with
     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-
     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the
     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-
     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her
     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.
     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's
     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp
     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls
     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a
     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the
     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as
     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls
     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and
     tosses it upon the blaze.

     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in
     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL
     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.
     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks
     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The
     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward
     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering
     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing
     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies
     once were.

     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly
     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-
     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force
     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the
     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural
     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as
     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam
     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally
     come.

Scene #12, Interior, Day, Dining Room










1    ED - W


     Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
     tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of
     view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view
     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small
     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by
     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.



2    ED - CAR


     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of
     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be
     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving
     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a
     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.



3    ID - CAR


     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY
     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.
     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts,
     and are students along with the others at that univer-
     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen
     to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the
     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
     were a drum.


                             SHELLY

               (Singing with the music)... Together,
               forever...


                             SCOTT

               Ash, where are we?


                             ASHLY

               I'll tell ya in a second. Now we're
               still on seventy-five just past the
               county border...



4    ED - W


     Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the
     dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
     to peer downward. Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
     mobile speeding along the narrow highway below.



5    ID - CAR


     ASHLY traces a route on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Which would put us...which would
               put us...


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ, just tell us already
               will ya?


     ASHLY zeroes in on the map with his finger.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


     SCOTT is growing impatient.


                             ASHLY

               ...Right...


                             SCOTT

               Yes?


                             ASHLY

               Here!


     Suddenly, the radio stops, and the steering wheel jerks
     from SCOTT's hand.



6    ED - CAR


     The car screetches out of control into the opposite lane.
     A large oncoming tanker truck with its horn screaming
     races toward the car on a collision coarse.



7    ID - CAR


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, watch out!



8    ED - CAR


     The truck races closer.



9    ID - CAR


     Their steering wheel is locked.


                             ASHLY

               Turn!



10   ED - CAR


     At the last possible instant, SCOTT's wheel again can
     be controlled, and the car swerves sharply back into its
     own lane.



11   ED - CAR


     The truck speeds harmlessly past them.



12   ID - CAR


                             ASHLY

               Damn it Scott, what the hell was that?
               You trying to kill us?


                             SCOTT

               Don't yell at me, it's your lousy
               steering wheel. The damn thing jerked
               right out of my hand.


                             ASHLY

               I can't understand it. I just had
               this thing in for a tune-up.


                             SHELLY

               Radio's dead too, ace.


                             ASHLY

               And I just had 'em tune up the whole
               thing yesterday.


                             SCOTT

               Well, then take it back 'cause the
               damn thing don't work. Only thing
               that works on the whole car is the
               lousy horn.


     SCOTT honks the horn.



13   ED - CAR


     Several local MEN walking down the highway respond to
     the horn by waving.



14   ID - CAR


     SCOTT yells out the window at them.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, go to hell, I'm not waving at ya!


     He looks in the rear view mirror. The MEN are still wav-
     ing in the distance. SCOTT turns back to drive.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     SHELLY turns around in the front seat and holds up a
     pint of Scotch.


                             SHELLY

               Well, I'd like to make a toast. To
               Scott who almost killed us.


                             SCOTT

               Aw, eat shit and die will ya?


     SHELLY and the others laugh.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end
               in a wonderful cabin with good friends,
               (She glances at SCOTT) provided we
               live that long.


     SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
     back to ASHLY and LINDA. ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.


                         ASHLY and LINDA

               ...With good friends.


     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY
     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes
     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite "No,
     thank you," then back up front to SCOTT.


                             LINDA

               Hey Scotty, what's this place like
               anyway?


                             SCOTT

               Well, the guy that's renting it says
               it's an old place, little run down,
               but it's right up in the mountains-
               totally secluded. (He takes a drink
               from the bottle) Best part is, we
               get it so cheap.


                             LINDA

               Why are we getting it so cheap?


                             SCOTT

               I don't know, might be in real bad
               shape.


                             CHERYL

               You mean nobody's seen this place
               yet?


                             SCOTT

               Not yet.


                             ASHLY

               Might not be too bad.


                             LINDA

               No...


                             ASHLY

               Actually, it might be very nice.


                             LINDA

               Yeah...


                             SHELLY

               It's probably a real pit.


                             CHERYL

               I can't believe that we're renting
               a place for a week-end that nobody's
               seen.


                             SCOTT

               (Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ,
               not this again...


                             CHERYL

               (Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and
               dad would never let us go up to a place
               like this if they knew-


                             ASHLY

               -Which is exactly why they don't know.
               I'll tell you who I am gonna call.
               The guys that fixed up this car.



15   ED - CAR


     The car approaches an exit along the highway.



16   ID - CAR


     ASHLY glances at the map again.


                             ASHLY

               Hey, I think this is where we get
               off.



17   ED - CAR


     The car turns off the main highway and follows several
     back roads until it approaches a narrow dirt lane that
     winds upward along a twin set of mountains.



18   ID - CAR


     SCOTT glances up to the peaks.


                             SCOTT

               These mountains seem familiar.


                             LINDA

               What do they remind you of? Some-
               thing majestic? Adventure?


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, more like adventure.


                             LINDA

               Any adventure in particular?


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's sweater.


     ASHLY and SCOTT laugh out loud. LINDA laughs quietly,
     and CHERYL lets out an embarassed giggle to herself.


                             SHELLY

               (Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it
               Scotty, when you least expect it,
               you're gonna get it good.



19   ED - B


     Finally, the car arrives at a wooden bridge extending
     over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses.



20   ED - CAB


     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-
     ues to sputter and backfire.



21   ID - CAR


     ASHLY reacts to his car.


                             ASHLY

               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.
               but I'm just not paying for it.


                             LINDA

               This place is perfect.


                             CHERYL

               The woods come awfully close to the
               house don't they?


                             SCOTT

               So what's wrong with the woods, they
               can't bite ya.


                             CHERYL

               It's just a little claustrophobic
               that's all.


                             LINDA

               Well, I think it's beautiful.


                             SHELLY

               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-
               end.



22   ED - CAB


     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.


                             SCOTT

               It's supposed to be one of these on
               here.


     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.



23   ID - M.R.


     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT
     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.
     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings
     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,
     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently
     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door
     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap
     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.


                             SCOTT

               Hey, this place has a dungeon.


     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over
     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing
     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
     to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Put these back will you?


     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the
     hatch but cannot.


                             SCOTT

               They nailed it shut.


                             CHERYL

               Good, I don't like cellars. Probably
               just some garbage down there anyways.


                             SCOTT

               Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in
               cellars. I mean it's not going to
               try and get out or anything.


                             CHERYL

               Well, what's down there?


                             SCOTT

               Well, could be any number of things.
               Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead
               bodies-


                             LINDA

               Hey, look at this!


     LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
     father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it
     begins to tick.


                             LINDA

               Ta daaaaaa!


     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.



24   ET - CAB


     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.



25   IT - M.R.


     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She
     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the
     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil
     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-
     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-
     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can
     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-
     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the
     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale
     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.
     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some
     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch
     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open
     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale
     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks
     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some
     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.
     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping
     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns
     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-
     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.
     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from
     the cellar.



26   IT - K/M.R.


     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-
     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between
     her and the trap door.


                             ASHLY

               What're you drawing Cheryl?


     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his
     shoulder to glance at it.


                             CHERYL

               I...I don't know.


                             ASHLY

               Is it a bible?


                             CHERYL

               No, no it's no bible. (She glances
               again at the cellar, knowing some-
               thing is down there) I don't know
               what it is.


                             LINDA

               Well, this one of the clock's not
               bad.


     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to
     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She
     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL
     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
     of her to speak secretly.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) I got it right here.


     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking
     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's
     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.
     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, this is really good. I like
               how you did the numbers in that wood-
               ish style.


     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on
     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She
     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although
     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with
     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.


                             ASHLY

               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd
               like it.


     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his
     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
     on CHERYL's small drawing table.


                             LINDA

               It's really good Cheryl. Very close
               to the origional.


                             CHERYL

               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very
               close.


                             LINDA

               I'm gonna check dinner.


     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.


                             ASHLY

               You better get washed up. I'll see
               ya in there.


     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL
     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of
     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-
     ing...waiting.



27   IT - K


     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.
     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.



28   IT - D.R.


     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA
     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the
               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...


                             CHERYL

               Will you stop it?


                             LINDA

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.


                             SCOTT

               Will you relax, I'm just kidding
               around. She can take a joke-


     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He
     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in
     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,
     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.


                             SCOTT

               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.


     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.


                             SCOTT

               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.


     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.


                             ASHLY

               I'd like to make a toast for all
               here this evening. As a greek friend
               of mine once said, "Nis-hat-nis-fert-
               dis-ruben-tu-tar-im."


                             LINDA

               Which means?


                             SCOTT

               Party down!


     The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of
     wood heard from the main room.


                             SCOTT

               What the hell...


     All stand from the table and hurry to the main room.



29   IN - M.R.


     The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
     out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open.
     They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to
     what could have done this. CHERYL is slighly more nervous
     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.


                             ASHLY

               (Slowly) What is this?


                             SCOTT

               Whatever it is, it's still down there.


                             CHERYL

               I don't like cellars, let's close it
               up. (She does not want to deal with
               it) It's probably just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
               that's the stupidest thing I ever
               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.


     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He
     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.


                             LINDA

               Maybe it is just some animal.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah, probably right. It's probably
               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why
               don't you make sure.


     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
     back.


                             CHERYL

               Scotty, I'm not going down there!


                             SCOTT

               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.


                             LINDA

               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you
               go down there. Why don't you wait
               until morning.


                             SCOTT

               Look, I'll be all right.


                             SHELLY

               What melodrama! What courage! A kiss
               my brave hero.


     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends
     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.


                             SHELLY

               I, your virgin queen eagerly await
               the precious moment when you will
               ascend.


                             SCOTT

               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and
     ASHLY wait above.


                             ASHLY

               (Calling down) Hey Scott, see any-
               thing?


     There is no answer.


                             ASHLY

               Hey Scott!...Scott!


                             SHELLY

               He's just kidding around.


     There is silence.


                             SHELLY

               Isn't he?


     No sounds come from the cellar.


                             ASHLY

               Linda, get me a flashlight.


                             LINDA
               That's the only one we brought up.


     ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.


                             ASHLY

               Then get that lantern.


     LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,
     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.



30   IN - C


     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In
     front of him stands an old door which leads to another
     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.
     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with
     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the
     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his
     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.


                             ASHLY

               Scott?


     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into
     a pair of arms which grab him.


                             ASHLY

               Ahhhhhhh!


     It is only SCOTT behind him.


                             ASHLY

               What the hell are you doing down
               here, jerkin' off? How come you
               didn't answer me?


                             SCOTT

               When?


                             ASHLY

               Just now, I mean upstairs.


                             SCOTT

               I didn't hear you.


                             ASHLY

               Oh well, did you find anything?


                             SCOTT

               Uh-uh.


                             ASHLY

               What's this?


     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,
     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the
     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover
     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and
     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.



31   EN - CAB


     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.



32   IN - M.R.


     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed
     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once
     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man
     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.


                             ASHLY

               Shhh, listen to this.


                             VOICE

               My name is Julian Knowby. I am a pro-
               fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology
               in Dextin university's ancient history
               department...


                             ASHLY

               This is the tape I found downstairs.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...I am recording this
               entry from a small cabin in the south-
               ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am
               staying with my wife for a few weeks
               so that I may continue my research un-
               disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-
               iate professors and myself have been
               excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I
               believe I have made an important find
               in that area, and thus the reason for
               this log. With it, I can keep an ac-
               curate record of translations from
               my latest find; the first of six, the
               others still lost, volumes of ancient
               Sumarian burial practices and rites.
               Basically, it is a book of do's and
               don'ts dealing with the deceased en-
               titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans-
               lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound
               in human flesh, and inked with blood
               of the deceased...


                             SCOTT

               Jeez, I'd hate to find out what they
               used for pens.


                             VOICE

               (Continuing)...This particular volume
               deals with demons and demon resurrect-
               ion. These are of the Katardi family,

               main. The first few pages that I have
               translated warn that these demons are
               dangerous, everpresent, and exist
               primarily through this book. As legend
               has it, only the sacred high priests
               of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess
               these books, for they alone could
               properly control the resurrected de-

               reciting the resurrection passage
               that these demons would be able to

                             SCOTT

               Hey, what'd you do that for? It was
               just getting good.


                             CHERYL

               I just don't want to hear any more
               that's all.


                             SCOTT

               (Singing) Cheryl's scared, Cheryl's
               scared.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, leave her alone will ya?


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Christ.


     He moves to the tape recorder and fast forewards it for
     a bit then stops.


                             SCOTT

               She's acting like a baby- it's no
               big deal.


     He turns the machine on. The passage continues.

               (Louder now) Shut it off.


     ASHLY, hearing her for the first time, turns from the
     window to CHERYL. She is overwhealmed with fear.

     CHERYL can no longer control herself. She screams and
     covers her ears.


                             CHERYL

               Shut it offffff!


     The window shatters when a branch from a nearby tree
     tears through it. ASHLY runs to the tape recorder and
     turns it off. CHERYL is crying now, and runs to her room.
     ASHLY turns to SCOTT.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, you knew not to play it, I
               mean...I mean you knew it was upset-
               ting her. You just don't know when
               you're carrying something too far.


                             SCOTT

               (To SHELLY) C'mon. (Back to ASHLY)
               Big deal, it's just a joke, shit.


     SCOTT and SHELLY head for their bedroom. SCOTT mumbles
     to himself along the way.


                             SCOTT

               You'd think she's three years old or
               something.


     SCOTT slams the door behind him. ASHLY sighs. He moves
     to the broken window and reaches through it to close
     the outside shutters.


                             LINDA

               He's really been bothering you hasn't
               he?


     ASHLY walks to a chair near the other window.


                             ASHLY

               No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay.
               It's just that ever since we came
               up here, things have been a little
               too tense. (He sits) All these crazy
               things going on. And look at that
               window- we're gonna have to pay for
               that window now.


                             LINDA

               It'll be better tomorrow. Things'll
               smooth out, you'll see.


                             ASHLY

               I hope so.


     He looks at LINDA lovingly for a long moment.


                             ASHLY

               What'ya say we stay up for a while
               and listen to the storm.


                             LINDA

               Deal. Lemme check on Cheryl. I'll be
               right back.


     From across the room, she is seen opening CHERYL's door
     a crack. LINDA asks if she is all right, and gets a
     muffled reply. In the foreground, ASHLY removes the
     small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in
     his hand. He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's
     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the
     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens
     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are
     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA
     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again
     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,
     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping
     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box
     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again
     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.


                             LINDA

               Ah ha!


                             ASHLY

               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind
               eh? It's for you.


     LINDA begins to open the box.


                             LINDA

               It better be good.


     The gold necklace is revealed inside.


                             LINDA

               Oh Ash, it's beautiful.


     LINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box
     and holds it around her neck.


                             ASHLY

               (Fastening it around her neck) I was
               going to give it to you before we
               left, but things got so hectic, this
               is the first chance I've had. Do you
               like it?


     LINDA moves to a mirror.


                             LINDA

               It's beautiful. I really love it.
               (She turns to ASHLY) I'll never take
               it off.

     Lightning strikes as something in the woods examines the
     small cottage. Through the outside window, ASHLY and
     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them
     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette
     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force
     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,
     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a
     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.
     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks
     at it, then out to the dark woods.



44   IN - C.B.


     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the
     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A
     noise almost like that of something breathing.



45   EN - CAB


     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL
     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be
     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind
     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering
     about.


                             CHERYL

               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody
               out there?


     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage
     toward the woods.



46   EN - W


     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.
     CHERYL stops.


                             CHERYL

               I know someone's out there...I
               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.


     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms
     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.
     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind
     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest
     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can
     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows
     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of
     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth
     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin
     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty
     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.
     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She
     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,
     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,
     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry
     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap
     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches
     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now
     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to
     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges
     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is
     still following.



47   EN - CAB


     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She
     begins pounding upon the door.


                             CHERYL

               Help, help, let me in. Open the door!


     The evil entity now emerges from the woods.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly! Linda! Open up!


     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where
     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-
     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but
     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer
     with each key.


                             CHERYL

               Please, someone please! Help me, help
               meeeee!


     The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are
     so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends
     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is
     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She
     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.

               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill
               me. I, I heard a noise and...and I
               ran and the trees...the trees!

               What are you-


     He is cut off by ASHLY approaching with the others.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl what's wrong with you? Did
               something in the woods do this to
               you?


                             CHERYL

               No, no, no...the woods themselves-
               The trees- they're alive...


     She hugs ASHLY tightly and cries in hysterical sobs.


                             CHERYL

               They're alive...


                             LINDA

               Ash, why don't I take her into the
               bedroom so she can lie down a little-


                             CHERYL

               (Cutting her off) -I'm not lying
               down! I'm not staying here. We're
               leaving this place, we're leaving
               this place right now!


                             SCOTT

               Wait a minute, I'm sure as hell not
               going anywhere.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl-


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
               Trees do not attack people.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly, will you drive me into town
               or not?


                             ASHLY

               (Looking at his watch) Right Now?
               (He realizes how desperate she is)
               Sure, sure I'll drive you into town.
               But if you'll just listen to what
               you're saying, you-


                             CHERYL

               I don't care how it sounds. I want
               to leave this minute. You can bring
               back my things when you go.


                             ASHLY

               Okay- if you don't want to stay, I
               can't make you.


     LINDA puts a coat around CHERYL as ASHLY helps her to
     the door.

     ASHLY and CHERYL move to the car. ASHLY helps CHERYL in

               I'll stay some place in town tonight.


     ASHLY tries to start the car. There is no response.
     CHERYL becomes somewhat worried. ASHLY tries again.
     The car will not turn over. A look of dread comes
     across CHERYL's face.



51   EN - CAB


     SCOTT and the others join the two outside.



52   IN - CAR


                             CHERYL

               It's not gonna start.


     ASHLY again tries the engine.


                             CHERYL

               I know it's not gonna start. It's
               not gonna let us leave.


     ASHLY keys the engine and it turns over this time, start-
     ing up with a roar. ASHLY, worried by CHERYL's condition
     glances over to her. Confused and upset, CHERYL turns
     away from ASHLY and looks out her window. They drive off
     into the night through the wooded mountains toward town.
     ASHLY glances at CHERYL who is studying the forest in-
     tensely for any sign of movement. The concern for his
     sister is made obvious by the expression on his face.
     Their car approaches the narrow bridge area and slows
     down.


                             CHERYL

               Why are you slowing down?


     ASHLY brings the car to a halt.


                             CHERYL

               What is this?


     ASHLY's gaze is fixed directly ahead, and his mouth opens
     slowly. He flips on the high beams which stab through the
     evening mist.

     The bridge over the chasm has been torn away. CHERYL is
     silent as ASHLY walks to the ravine's edge to examine
     any remains.

               no...it's not going to let us leave,
               it's not going to let us go...it's

     An axe is raised into the air, then brought down smash-
     ing upon a log, splitting it in two. SCOTT is chopping
     wood outside the cabin. Behind him, through a window,
     CHERYL sits with a cup of tea in her hand watching him.
     SCOTT sets his axe down, gathers the wood and moves
     away. CHERYL shifts her gaze from SCOTT to the woods
     beyond. The camera moves in toward CHERYL then past
     her to SHELLY and LINDA who can be seen playing cards
     on the floor. ASHLY is seated near the fireplace with
     the tape recorder in front of him. He plugs an earphone
     in so only he can hear it. SCOTT enters the cabin and
     passes in front of ASHLY to drop his wood to one side
     of the fireplace. He throws a log in, and heads back
     outside.



56   IN - M.R.


     From inside, LINDA speaks.


                             LINDA

               Cheryl, wanna play some cards?


                             CHERYL

               (Turning with a smile) Uh-uh.


     CHERYL turns to face the window again.


                             LINDA

               Hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find
               some way around that cliff into town
               okay?


                             CHERYL

               Okay.


     Outside the window, SCOTT chops more wood for the nights
     fire. ASHLY turns on the tape recorder to listen with
     the ear plug.

               March 12th. Suzanne came after me
               and almost murdered me. My own wife.
               At first I thought it was a mental
               or physical disorder because of what
               had happened to her eyes, but I was
               only fooling myself. I knew what it
               was.


     Outside the window, SCOTT continues to chop and gather
     wood. SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds
     up one in particular.


                             SHELLY

               Okay, guess this card.


                             LINDA

               How am I going to know what card
               that is?


                             SHELLY

               Guess, I'm going to see if you're
               psychic.


     The card is a two of clubs.


                             LINDA

               Okaaaay...is it a queen?


                             SHELLY

               Right!


                             LINDA

               Really?


                             SHELLY

               Yeah.


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, I guessed the card right.


                             ASHLY

               (indifferently) Truly amazing Linda.


     He is listening intently to the log as it continues.


                             VOICE

               Three days have passed since that
               thing has been down there. I was hop-
               ing to weaken it without food or
               water. Nothing worked. Finally, in
               desperation I dragged her out to the
               shed and dismembered her so that what-
               ever it was could not get up again.


                             SHELLY

               Cheryl, did you see that?


     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the
     window.


                             SHELLY

               Try this one.


     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.


                             LINDA

               Okay, lemme think, uh...


     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-
     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.


                             LINDA

               ...Um, it's a seven.


                             SHELLY

               Oh my God, what suit?


                             LINDA

               Diamonds, no wait! I mean hearts!


                             SHELLY

               That's right- seven of hearts!


                             LINDA

               Hey Ash, did you see that? I guessed
               two cards in a row.


                             ASHLY

               (Still not paying attention) How do
               you do it Linda?


     He is concentrating on the tape.


                             VOICE

               This is when I saw the dark figures
               moving about in the woods. I should
               have never tampered with the "Book
               Of The Dead." I now know that what-
               ever it is I have resurrected through
               this book, is coming for me.


                             LINDA

               You know, I always thought I had
               some sort of extra sense. You know,
               like e.s.p or something.


                             SHELLY

               What's this one?


     She holds up the queen of spades.


                             LINDA

               Another seven!


                             SHELLY

               I don't believe it!


                             CHERYL

               (Still looking outside) Queen of
               spades.


     SHELLY looks at her card then back to CHERYL. She holds
     up another card.


                             CHERYL

               Four of hearts.


     The card is a four of hearts. SHELLY bites her lip in
     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen
     in silence.


                             CHERYL

               Eight of spades.


     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.


                             CHERYL

               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-
               jack of clubs-


     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY
     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward
     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of
     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.
     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about
     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-
     like her own.


                             CHERYL

               Why have you disturbed our sleep,
               awakened us from our ancient slum-
               ber? You will die. Like the others
               before you. We will take you one by
               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the
     floor.


                             ASHLY

               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!


     SHELLY does not respond.


                             ASHLY

               Hurry!


     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL
     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but
     behind her, she reaches for a pen.


                             LINDA

               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.
               What's wrong with her?


     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.


                             SCOTT

               What happened to her?


     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.


                             LINDA

               Look at her eyes.


     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,
     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,
     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.
     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied
     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping
     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining
     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin
     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting
     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-
     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.
     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward
     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull
     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when
     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses
     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to
     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above
     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the
     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA
     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She
     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut
     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push
     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top
     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the
     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented
     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand
     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the
     chain across the hatch.



57   IN - LB


     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.
     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks
     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.



58   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in
     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and
     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's
     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her
     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.


                             SCOTT

               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a
               bad bump.


                             ASHLY

               (Quietly) Yeah.


     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below
     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.


                             ASHLY

               We've still got a few hours before
               morning.


                             SHELLY

               I don't know if I can wait that
               long.


                             SCOTT

               You have to. We all have to. Then,
               once it's light out, we'll try to
               find a way to get around that chasm.


                             SHELLY

               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep
               making those horrible noises?


                             ASHLY

               I don't know.


                             SHELLY

               And what about her eyes?


     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.


                             SHELLY

               What about her eyes? (Desperately)
               For God's sake what happened to
               her eyes?!


     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a
     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the
     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches
     and listens to what is said above. From her point of
     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be all right.


     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow
     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.



59   EN - CAB


     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves
     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs
     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil
     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin
     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves
     behind a bush.



60   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.


                             SHELLY

               Scotty, I...I think there's some-
               thing out there.


     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.



61   EN - CAB


     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,
     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-
     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.



62   IN - M.R.


     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.


                             SCOTT

               ...Is to get some rest. Ash and I
               can stay up with Cheryl.


                             SHELLY

               Okay.


                             SCOTT

               Everything's gonna be okay. Come
               morning- you'll see.


     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the
     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with
     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY
     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.
     It stands silent.



63   EN - CAB


     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees
     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.
     She begins to undress near the window. The force now
     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous
     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.
     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream
     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.



64   IN - M.R.


     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the
     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places
     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly, are you okay?


     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns
     to ASHLY.


                             SCOTT

               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.



65   IN - S.B.


     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing
     amidst the shadows.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows
     upon the curtains.



66   IN - S. BATH


     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the
     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly?


     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT
     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the
     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.
     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's
     face and clothes with her nails.



67   IN - S.B.


     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY
     still upon him biting at his throat.



68   IN - M.R.


     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to
     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She
     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot
     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her
     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are
     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns
     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.


                             SHELLY

               Thank you. I don't know what I would
               have done if I had remained on the hot
               coals burning my pretty flesh. You
               have pretty skin- give it to us!


     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-
     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries
     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with
     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-
     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from
     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up
     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat
     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.
     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT
     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings
     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices
     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.
     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits
     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's
     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches
     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and
     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor
     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now
     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the
     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming
     the blade into her spine.

     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the
     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her
     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours
     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY
     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.
     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes
     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-
     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to
     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.


                             SCOTT

               Ahhhhhhh!


     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is
     dead.


                             ASHLY

               No...no...no...


                             SCOTT

               Hit her!


     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,
     and laughing madly.


                             SCOTT

               Hit it!


     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands
     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY
     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT
     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams
     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and
     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe
     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the
     final chop, there is silence.

     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-
     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and
     something must be done.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...Scott.


                             SCOTT

               Yeah.


                             ASHLY

               What is uh...what are we gonna do?


                             SCOTT

               Bury her.


                             ASHLY

               You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend
               of ours isn't she?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, she's dead.


     ASHLY moves away from SCOTT.


                             SCOTT

               Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury
               her now.


     ASHLY bites his lip and looks about blankly.



69   EN - CAB


     Finally, the body is dragged outside and buried near
     the work shed. Harsh floodlights from the house make the
     task look very stark and barren.



70   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's
     room to check in on her.



71   IN - L.B.


     He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully.



72   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY quietly returns to the main room. SCOTT is load-
     ing new batteries into a flashlight.


                             SCOTT

               I saw an old hiking trail when we
               were driving up here. Now I don't
               know if it goes all the way around
               that gorge-


                             ASHLY

               -Or if it's even still in tact.


                             SCOTT

               Or if it's even still in tact. But
               uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good
               care of Linda.


                             ASHLY

               I will. Do you have everything?


                             SCOTT

               (Putting on a small back pack) Yeah-
               all set.


                             ASHLY

               Listen...Scotty...I'm sorry about
               falling apart like that when-


                             SCOTT

               Don't bother, really.


     He steps out the door.


                             SCOTT

               If I find a way out of here, I'll
               mark it and then come back. Then if
               I'm not back here in a few hours...
               if for some reason...well, if I don't
               come back, grab Linda, leg and all,
               and just get her the hell out of here.


     They shake hands.


                             ASHLY

               You're a good man.


                             SCOTT

               Good, I'm the best.



73   EN - CAB


     ASHLY smiles a good-bye to SCOTT and watches him move
     off into the night. He lingers for a moment by SHELLY's
     grave, then slowly disappears into the woods.



74   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY closes the door and turns back to the main room.
     He sees CHERYL's eyes through the crack in the cellar.
     She has been watching all of this through a space be-
     tween the trap door and floor. ASHLY walks past her to
     LINDA's room.



75   IN - L.B.


     He opens the door and a crack of light falls across her.
     LINDA wakes up.


                             LINDA

               Who's there? Ash?


                             ASHLY

               It's me Linda.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I had a bad dream about Linda.


                             ASHLY

               You did baby?


                             LINDA

               Yeah. She's all right isn't she?


                             ASHLY

               Yeah. Fine.


                             LINDA

               Is Shelly okay too Ash?


     ASHLY can no longer hide his fear and anxiety. He speaks
     in a whisper so as not to let his voice quiver.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's
               all.


                             LINDA

               Ash, I love you. (She turns over)


                             ASHLY

               Get some rest.


     ASHLY closes the door behind him and the fear from a few
     hours ago engulfs him once more.



76   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY moves into the main room and stops dead in his
     tracks when a voice in the cellar speaks.


                             CHERYL

               You lied to her. You lied to Linda.
               Shelly's not sleeping. She's dead.
               Don't you know the difference? You
               killed her. You and Scott cut her up
               with the axe. She's dead ha-ha-ha-ha-
               ha-ha-


     ASHLY picks up the axe and slams it down upon the trap
     door. CHERYL is silent from below for a moment, then
     the hatch opens an inch or so. (The length of the chain
     securing it) CHEYL's white eyes can be seen again.


                             CHERYL

               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY takes the axe and steps outside.



77   EN - CAB


     He begins to chop wood, taking out his emotions upon
     the logs with each blow. SHELLY's blood can still be
     seen on the blade of the axe.



78   IN - M.R.


     From her dungeon, CHERYL watches ASHLY chop wood in the
     window. The shadow of his axe rising then striking is
     seen over her white eyes.



79   EN - CAB


     Exhausted, ASHLY puts down the axe. He looks off into
     the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT. He returns to
     the cabin.



80   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL begins her taunting again.


                             CHERYL

               Soon all of you will be like me and
               then who will lock you in the cellar?
               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap
     door. ASHLY walks by her to LINDA's room.



81   IN - L.B.


     She is still asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake her, ASHLY
     pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. He re-
     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does
     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-
     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still
     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with
     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets
     out a low growl.



82   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through
     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back
     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to
     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something
     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated
     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY
     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He
     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching
     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the
     couch so he can sit. SCOTT is in agony and can barely
     speak.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I
               can't feel my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay.
               You're gonna be just fine- you'll see.


     He throws another log on the fire.


                             ASHLY

               You'll see.


     He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone.
     She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where
     ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor-
     rible rasping sounds.

                             SCOTT

               It's, it's not gonna let us leave...
               Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're
               all gonna die here...


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die!


                             SCOTT

               ...All gonna die. All of us.


     ASHLY grabs SCOTT and shakes him violently.


                             ASHLY

               We're not gonna die! We're not gonna
               die! We're getting out of here! Now
               listen to me- is there a way around
               the chasm.


     SCOTT passes out.


                             ASHLY

               Scotty. Scott!


     ASHLY slaps SCOTT. He stirs awake and mumbles.


                             SCOTT

               Jesus Ash. I don't want to die. So...
               so lonely to die like this. You're not
               gonna leave me are you? Are you Ash?


                             CHERYL

               (Imitating SCOTT) I don't want to
               die. So lonely to die like this. You're
               not gonna leave me are you? Are you
               Ash? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


                             ASHLY

               Scott, is there some way around the
               chasm?


                             SCOTT

               Ash, I'm scared- I...I can't feel
               my legs.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, listen to me please, for
               God's sake. Is there a way around
               the chasm?


                             SCOTT

               There is...one way, the trail...but
               the trees, they know...don't you see-
               they're alive!! They're ali-ahhhhhhh!


     His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain.
     Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over
     grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks
     to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.


                             ASHLY

               Shut up!


     She continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in
     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but
     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on
     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety
     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.


                             ASHLY

               God forgive me Linda.


     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It
     is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle.


                             LINDA

               Ash, oh Ash, help Me! Please.


     She hugs him tightly.


                             LINDA

               Don't let them take me away again,
               please, please, please.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and holding her tightly) I
               won't, I won't- I promise.


     CHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.


                             CHERYL

               Ashly? Ashly, help me. Let me out
               of here. I'm all right now.


     ASHLY releases LINDA and moves cautiously to the cellar.
     LINDA remains behind nervously fumbling with her necklace.


                             CHERYL

               I'm all right now, Ashly. I'm all
               right. Come unlock this chain and
               let me out.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     There is no reply from the cellar. ASHLY looks through
     the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the
     chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something
     wrong, he stops.


                             ASHLY

               Cheryl?


     He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-
     est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards
     and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand
     reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly
     it withdraws beneath the floor.


                             CHERYL

               (A little too sweet) Ash, what are you
               doing? This is your sister Cheryl. Don't
               you recognize me?


     Her voice drifts off, and the evil leughter resumes from
     the celler.


                             ASHLY

               (Crying and yelling to the cellar)
               You bastards! Why are you doing this?
               Why?


     There is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him
     begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more,
     and she laughs at ASHLY.


                             ASHLY

               Oh...Linda.


     With newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by
     the legs and drags her outside.



83   EN - CAB


                             LINDA

               It's useless, useless, useless. In
               time we'll come for him, then you
               ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-


     ASHLY leaves her in the woods and runs back to the cabin,
     closing the door behind him.



84   IN - M.R.


     SCOTT is coughing again.


                             SCOTT

               Ash, Ash, please...I don't want to
               die- but...but I can't stand this
               pain. It hurts Ash. Gimme something.
               Gimme something to put me out.


                             ASHLY

               Scott, I can't. I- I know it's bad.
               But I can't be alone now, I can't.
               I'd lose my mind.


                             SCOTT

               Please Ash, please.


                             ASHLY

               You'll get better- you'll see.


     LINDA's laughter is faintly heard outside. ASHLY moves
     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no
     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-
     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.


                             ASHLY

               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be
               better and we'll both get out of
               here tomorrow.


                             SCOTT

               There is no tomorrow! You- you've
               got to kill her and cut- cut her
               up- your sister too.


                             ASHLY

               No, that was only with Shelly. You
               had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves
               me. You're delirious- I...I'll get
               you some water.


     ASHLY places a glass to Scott's lips.


                             ASHLY

               Now, now the sun will be up in an
               hour or so and we'll get out of here
               ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly-
               n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go
               home together. Wouldn't you like to
               be going home? You'd like that I'd
               bet, wouldn't ya?


     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of
     his mouth.


                             ASHLY

               ...Scott.


     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY
     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There
     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the
     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting
     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs
     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.
     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs
     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against
     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled
     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and
     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm
     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY
     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-
     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The
     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.
     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in
     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.

     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of
     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,
     through the back door and out to the work shed.



85   IN - W.S.


     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body
     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails
     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the
     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves
     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a
     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks
     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He
     turns off the saw.


                             ASHLY

               (In a whisper) Linda...


     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's
     body.



86   EN - CAB


     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the
     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.
     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.
     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create
     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's
     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of
     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel
     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.



87   IN - M.R.


     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists
     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants
     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to
     loosen.



88   EN - CAB


     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to
     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.



89   IN - M.R.


     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the
     trap door in tact.



90   EN - CAB


     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on
     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up
     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied
     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she
     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out
     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's
     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large
     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs
     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him
     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY
     hits the ground with considerable force and for the
     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's
     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on
     the ground.


                             ASHLY

               Stay back.


     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA
     advances toward him, laughing.


                             ASHLY

               Linda please, if you can still hear
               me. Keep away.


     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,
     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the
     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into
     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-
     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from
     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.
     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace
     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
     staggers back to the cabin.



91   IN - M.R.


     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.


                             ASHLY

               Oh.....


     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open
     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.
     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the
     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.



92   IN - S.B.


     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs
     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward
     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only
     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of
     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.
     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL
     backs away and spots the open front door.


                             ASHLY

               The door...


     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.



93   IN - M.R.


     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.



94   EN - CAB


     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.



95   IN - MR


     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started
     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams
     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard
     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam
     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-
     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to
     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is
     his last shell.


                             ASHLY

               (To himself) More shells. Where did
               I see that box of shells?



96   IN - C


     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY
     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his
     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks
     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds
     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.
     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.



97   IN - M.R.


     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks
     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,
     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows
     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he
     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind
     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for
     something to happen. He is tense and more determined
     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.


                             ASHLY

               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why
               are you torturing me like this?

     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something
     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's
     necklace.


                             ASHLY

               ...Linda. (He whispers)


     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest
     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through
     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to
     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.
     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole
     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and
     fires at her head.



98   EN - CAB


     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL
     is jolted from the door.



99   IN - M.R.


     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in
     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens
     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He
     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.
     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into
     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several
     steps, then continues after ASHLY.



100  EN - CAB


     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.



101  IN - M.R.


     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of
     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at
     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.
     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges
     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY
     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The
     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY
     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL
     breaks through the front door and begins to push the
     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-
     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and
     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and
     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its
     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and
     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from
     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto
     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives
     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent
     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with
     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-
     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the
     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-
     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her
     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.
     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's
     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp
     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls
     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a
     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the
     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as
     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls
     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and
     tosses it upon the blaze.

     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in
     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL
     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.
     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks
     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The
     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward
     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering
     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing
     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies
     once were.

     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly
     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-
     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force
     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the
     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural
     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as
     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam
     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally
     come.

      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               To trace the origin of the Book, we
               must go back...back...to a day when
               spirits ruled the earth.

      An ox grazes nearby.  4 Warriors on horseback in the BG.

               It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same
      castle which we saw earlier, but now, in a ruined state.
      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               ...Waiting.

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.

      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it
               undisturbed.

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.

      The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded
      down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

      A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten

      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.

               It has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this

               It was one week later that a group
               of college students came to the cabin.


14A   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT                    14A

      The Delta 88 Oldsmobile parked out front.  Fog roars
      past the place.  We faintly hear waltz music from
      within.  The silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear
      bedroom window.


14B   INT. CABIN - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                     14B
      ASH AND LINDA

      LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in
      the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan
      State University" sweatshirt.  She hums melodically to
      the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a
      delicate silver necklace.


14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14C

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA
               Ash, what's that you're playing?

                              ASH
               Our song.

      Ash begins to play faster.


14D   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14D

      As she picks up the tempo, spinning and laughing,
      until finally Ash moves to her, halting her in mid
      spin.


14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    14E

      Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she
      stares deeply into Ash's eyes.  Her lips, parted,
      in a sensual manner.


14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      14F

      He returns her stare, lost in her beauty.  He pulls
      her close.

                              LINDA
               Ow!


14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY                               14G

      And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she
      wears about her neck.

14I   MEDIUM SHOT - LINDA AND ASH - TULIP CRANE             14I

      She looks from the necklace to Ash.

                              LINDA
               I really love it.  I'll never take
               it off.

      They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the
      haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

               It was in the cabin's cellar that they
               found the Professor's tape recorder,
               and the Book of the Dead.

      CAMERA tracks in toward the trap door.  It opens by
      itself as we move down the steps into the blackness.


15    MEDIUM SHOT - INT. CABIN CELLAR - NIGHT               15

      The CAMERA pans down from the blackness to Ash who
      finds a shotgun, Raymond Knowby's tape recorder,
      tapes, the Kandarian dagger and...


16    CLOSE SHOT                                            16

      The group of students sit about the fire as they listen
      to the tape recorder. Coming from the speaker is the voice
      of Raymond Knowby reciting the demon resurrection passage.

      Linda takes Ash's hand.  She's frightened.  Ash smiles
      to comfort her.  She nervously fingers the silver locket
      she wears about her neck.

      The cabin is in the distance.  In the foreground the
      earth begins to swell, then rips apart as a red glow
      emanates from beneath.  Something evil is being
      unleashed.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One by one, they fell to the possession
               of the dark spirits.

      ASH AND LINDA

      Possessed Linda is coming after Ash.  Ash back peddles,
      stumbles and falls.

      As the Shadow of approaching Linda envelops Ash,

      Ash buries Linda's headless body.  He jams a crude
      wooden burial cross into the earth of the grave.  A bolt
      of lightning strikes.

      Ash enters the cabin.  He sees The Book of the Dead
      and tosses it onto the flames.

      FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

      We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of
      an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through
      a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the
      cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door
      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of
      the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering
      away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly
      towards CAMERA and screams.

      The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an
      extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip.
      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,
      clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into
      a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked
      unconscious.

      He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us.
      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,
      his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of
      morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his
      beastly face skyward.

      unconscious.

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      vast area of empty woods around Ash.

      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to

      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      our vision of the "Road" ahead.  Our view suddenly
      clears, revealing a large tree that looms directly
      ahead.

      As he runs toward the cabin.  (Actually he is running
      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      We race into the cabin, splintering the hall door
      which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the
      rear hallway, and swings the hallway door shut.  We race
      right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces
      as we glide forward.

      Camera moves through the main room and up to the

      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin

      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of
      the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is
      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that
      slight space between the trap door and the floor we
      see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes
      a sigh of relief.

      The airplane rolls to a halt.  A man wearing a

      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

                              ANNIE
               Terrific.  I found the additional pages

                              ANNIE
               Tonight.  Is everything all set with my
               father?

                              ED
               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.

      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      He screams as...

      CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S CORPSE (OVERCRANKED)

      Linda's head rolls off of her neck and tumbles through
      space.


176   INT. BLACK STUDIO - NIGHT                             176
      LINDA'S HEAD - ON WIRE

      As it tumbles through a void of blackness, falling.


177   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          177
      CLOSE SHOT - ASH

      As he screams himself awake.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
      him sitting in the rocking chair.  Ash halts his scream,
      getting control of himself.  He looks to the window that
      had blown open.


178   ASH'S POV - THE BOARDED WINDOW                        178

      Still boarded as though it had never been opened.


179   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      179

      Reassuring himself.

                              ASH
               That's all.  Just a crummy dr-

      Linda's decapitated head falls into frame and lands in
      Ash's hands.


180   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             180

      It opens its eyes and looks to Ash.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Hello lover, I came from the other
               side of your dream to dance with you.


181   CLOSER SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD (BACKWARD MOTION)          181

      A four foot long blackened tongue emerges from her mouth
      like a lashing serpent.


182   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - (BACKWARD MOTION)                 182

      The tongue enters Ash's frame and forces itself into
      Ash's mouth.  Screaming as he clutches at the head of his
      former love.  The tongue instantly retracts inside her
      head.


183   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             183

186   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - ASH AND DUMMY HEAD - LONG SHOT   186

      As Ash staggers painfully around the side of the
      cabin and towards the work shed; Linda's head still
      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.


187A  MEDIUM SHOT - INT. WORK SHED - ASH                    187A

      As he places Linda's head within the vice and
      tightens it around her, then withdraws his hand.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Even now we have your darling Linda's
               soul!  She suffers in torment!


187B  CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               187B

      As it rips away an old tarp revealing the chalk
      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the
      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts
      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.


187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D

      Ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it
      toward the approaching blade.


187E  CLOSE SHOT                                            187E

      The crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a
      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.


187G  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187G

      Linda's head.


187J  WIDE SHOT - ASH AND LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE              187J

      From the chainsaw, fumes of blue amoke.  Ash turns
      to the head and falters.


187K  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD IN VICE                     187K

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.


187L  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187L

      Trying to fight his feelings, he knows what he must
      do.  He pumps the throttle on the saw.


187M  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    187M

      Pleading with him.

                              LINDA
               You promised me we'd always be
               together.  You swore to me!


187N  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187N

      Agonized.

                              ASH
               NO!


187O  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             187O

      Once again fully possessed, and speaking in the voice
      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO
               LINDA! YOUR LOVE WAS A LIE!  AND
               NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL!


187P  EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S DUMMY HEAD               187P

187Q  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187Q

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.


187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.


188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188

      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the
      work shed and towards the cabin.  Again clutching
      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.


189B  INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          189B

      Ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the
      sound.


189C  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV - THE ROCKING CHAIR     189C

      It rocks back and forth with a definitive motion,
      halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward
      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

      He slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless.


189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      His reflection is as it should be.


195   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      195

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S RIGHT HAND - DUMMY HAND
      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.


197   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          197
      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      The hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over
      Ash's head.  Then a bottle.


209   MEDIUM SHOT                                           209

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.

214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      CRANE

      The CAMERA cranes down as Annie's car approaches from
      the distance. It pulls to a halt. Ed and Annie step
      from the car.


218   ANNIE'S POV                                           218

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE
               Excuse me.  This the road to the
               Knowby's cabin?

                              JAKE
               Thas' right.  But you ain't goin' there.

                              ANNIE
               And why not?


219   CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     219

      As he reaches in his truck to pull on the headlights.

221   MEDIUM SHOT - JAKE, ANNIE, AND ED                     221

      All stand in the bright glare of the lights as the fog
      swirls about them.  Annie and Ed gape in frightened
      wonder at what they see.


222   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT - (SIDE II) - (STUDIO MINIATURE)  222
      THEIR POV - TABLE TOP MODEL GIRDERS

      The piercing beams of light illuminate twisted remnants of
      the destroyed bridge that leads to the cabin.  A road sign,
      similar to the one on the other side of the bridge
      reads: "Dangerous Bridge - Two Ton Weight Limit".

      Frightened as they view the wreckage.

                              ANNIE
               What happened?

                              JAKE
               Lady, I ain't never seen nothin' like
               it.

                              ED
               Terrific.  Now what?

                              ANNIE
               There must be another way in.
               Another road or something.


224   JAKE, BOBBY JOE, ANNIE AND ED - TWO CAMERAS           224

                              BOBBY JOE
               Sure ain't no, road.

      CAMERA pans over to reveal a brassy southern spitfire
      of a woman, Bobby Joe.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Hell you wanna go there for, anyway?

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.


224X  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE AND ED                            224X

      Annie steps forward.  She eyes Bobby Joe.

                              ANNIE
               None of your business.


224Y  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224Y

      He feigns surprise and pleasantness.

                              JAKE
               Hey!  I just remembered... Yeah,
               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

                              ED
               That sounds all right.

                              JAKE
               But, it'll cost ya.

                              ANNIE
               How much?

                              JAKE
               Forty Fi...


224A  ANGLE                                                 224A

      Jake looks up suddenly at Bobby Joe who gives
      a sharp shake of her head.

                              JAKE
               Hundred bucks.


224B  CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    224B

               you got a deal.


224C  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224C

      He glances through the window of Annie's car.


224D  JAKE'S POV                                            224D

      The tiny case containing the missing pages of the Book
      of the Dead, and a small handbag.


224E  CLOSE SHOT - JAKE                                     224E

      Looking back to Annie, a big smile on his near
      toothless face.

                              JAKE
               Sure!


225   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                    225

      A hiking trail winds through the woods.  Bobby Joe
      leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets
      some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who
      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

                              JAKE
               Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she
               was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn
               little pieces!

      A large moon hangs in the night sky.


228   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          228
      CLOSE SHOT - EVIL HAND

      No longer attached to Ash's arm, it still writhes about
      beneath Ash's foot which pins it to the floor.


229   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - HAND'S POV - EYEMO W/ MOUNT       229

      As he grabs the steel wastebasket, dumps out the trash
      lowers it quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand
      within.


230   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     230

      With a note of finality, Ash slams down a pile of books
      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".


231   FIREPLACE                                             231

      Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been
      resting upon the coals.  He grits his teeth.


232   ANGLE                                                 232

      Just out of frame, Ash thrusts the glowing shovel against
      the stump to cauterize the wound.  Red steam hisses up
      into frame as Ash screams.


233   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     233

      He tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering
      stump into a vase of fresh flowers.


234   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      234

      Unspooling a roll of duct tape.


235   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     235

      He tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage
      about his wrist.  Behind him, the wastebasket
      silently slides across the floor.


236   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     236

      "CLANG"! He turns to see.

      Upon its side.  The Evil Hand is gone.

      in the wall.

      He raises the shotgun and FIRES.  BLAM!  The floor
      next to the hand explodes.


249   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN THE WALL - SQUIB - EFX. HAND     249

      The hand leaps into the hole as a section of wall next
      to it EXPLODES.  Blam!


250   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      250

      Ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun.
      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      with a creak revealing the empty night.

               What the hell did you do to them?

               We'll throw him in there.

               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

      earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half-rotten human
      head juts up!  Just the eyes are above the surface of the
      dirt.  They dart about wildly and halt upon Ash.  Worms
      crawl from the rotted forehead.

      She turns her twisted body to face Ash.  Moths fly
      about her in a flurry.

      of keys.

                              ANNIE

      With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a
      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth
      lengthening, her mouth opening impossibly wide
      as though she were going to swallow his head, and all as
      she lunges forward.  She changes to "Pee Wee" head.

      Ash leaps down upon the trapdoor, slamming it to pin

      eyeball popping from her head, like a cork from a
      champagne bottle.

      her back down into the cellar. The trap door shuts.
      Ash leaps atop it. The sound of Henrietta falling down

      ravings.  Ash quickly threads the chains through the
      eyeloops.

                         (Voice on tape)
               I fear that whatever I have
               resurrected from this book, is sure
               to come calling for me.

      (SHAKI-CAM)

      The CAMERA takes the POV of the Evil Force as it
      glides through the woods. Over a stump, around the
      Oak trees, through a patch of fog, as the cabin comes
      into view.

               There's something out there.  That...
               witch in the cellar is only part of it.
               It lives out in those woods.  In the Dark.
               Something that's come back from the dead.

                              ASH
               Nobody goes out that door.  Not till
               daylight.


347A  THE GROUP                                             347A

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.


347B  CLOSE SHOT - HENRIETTA                                347B

                              HENRIETTA
               Let me out, dear.  It's so cold and dark
               in here.

                              ANNIE
               Mother?

                              HENRIETTA

      Annie starts to follow the instructions, but Ash halts
      her gently.  He shakes his head.  Annie snaps out of
      it.  She shakes her head and looks to the cellar.

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you
               are but you're not my mother.

      Annie begins to cry.

      Henrietta is crying also.

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               How can you say that to me Annie?

                              ANNIE
               No!

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

      Confused and tearful, she screams to the others in the
      room.

                              ANNIE
               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      wall behind her.  We watch as the shadow of Ash with the

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

               That trail we came in here on...
               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      Annie follows with the flickering oil lantern.

      The wind in the room suddenly stops.  He blows out his
      breath and watches it vaporize.  The screaming face of
      Raymond Knowby emerges from the wall.  A life like
      spirit made of swirling smoke and mist.

                              RAYMOND

      The ghost of Raymond points to Annie's glass case.

      Bobby Joe raises her hand into frame, to reveal Ash's
      Evil Hand clutched in hers.  Bobby Joe goes nuts,
      screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand
      from her.  She slams into the lantern, knocking it out.
      We lose them in the darkness.

      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its

      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

446   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    446

      As she quickly gives the pages a cursory glance.

                              ANNIE
               Here it is.  Two passages.

      For the first time, she smiles at Ash.

                              ANNIE
               We've got it!

447A  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                           447A

      Annie reads through the pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

               find her, we're gettin' the hell
               outta here.

                              ASH
               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

                              JAKE
               You two comin' with me.  I ain't goin'
               out there alone.

                              ASH
               NO, YOU IDIOT.  You'll kill us all.
               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

                              JAKE
               'Sides.  Now you ain't got no, choice.

      Jake pushes at Ash with the barrel of the shotgun.

                              JAKE
               Now move!

      Ash hesitates.

                              JAKE
               Move you son of a bitch!

      Jake, and then Possessed Ash is there, emerging from
      the darkness suddenly.  He raises his finger and
      points to Annie.  He speaks in the low garbled voice
      of a demon:

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.

               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      His face begins to change.  His skin loses its white
      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

      enters frame, charging him with axe, screaming.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.

               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.

      his head.

               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH

               we need those pages.

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the

      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

                              HENRIETTA
               Free!  Free at last!

      As the pee wee Head transformation continues, Henrietta's
      neck grows, like a jack in the box.  It extends
      a solid five feet upward, so that her head is now
      looking down upon Ash baring its teeth.

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.


605   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    605

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      As rotten apple head is sucked out the doorway of the
      cabin.  The door slams shut behind it.  Its scream
      echoes off into the distance.

      The cabin becomes much more quiet.  The sounds of the
      trees are gone.  Ash looks to Annie.  She is dead.  Ash
      moves to her, strokes her hair and begins to cry.

                              ASH
                You did it.  By God you did it.

      He lowers his head and begins to heave in sharp
      convulsive breaths of despair.

      BLAST.  The door is sucked down into the rift.  All
      of the objects in the room are sucked through the open

      of the Book of the Dead.

      to be swept outside by the force of the vacuum of the

      We are now within the vortex.  A swirling mass of colors
      and clouds.  And nightmarish sound effects.

      Objects come AT US from the distance and roar past, an
      uprooted tree, the grandfather clock with its hands
      winding backwards at an incredible rate, Ash spinning
      AT US, hand over foot, screaming.  The chainsaw still
      mounted to his wrist.

      As it seals shut, leaving only the blue sky and the
      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his
      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS
      stand directly over him.

      and poises it above Ash's head.

      A "WINGED DEADITE," a female harpy like creature with

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END
EVIL DEAD II

      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      TRACKING SHOT - ASH

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same
      castle which we saw earlier, but now, in a ruined state.
      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.

      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.

      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

      A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten

      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.

					RAYMOND
               It has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this

      LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in
      the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan

      the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a
      delicate silver necklace.

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA

      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the

      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,

      Rising over a mountain ridge.  Sunlight streaming
      through a gaping hole in the parting clouds, in
      bright shafts.  It pours through the trees.

      The bright edge of morning sunlight spreading across
      his face, he lets loose a demonic death shriek.

      The white in Ash's eyes swirls about, and his pupils
      change back to their original brown color.


41A   EXT. WOODS - DAWN                                     41A

      Ash, no longer possessed, collapses into the mud puddle,
      unconscious.


41B   EXT. WOODS - DAY - REVERSE ACTION - FOG - 3 ANGLES    41B

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      As he lies unconscious.  Time passes.


43    CLOSE SHOT - ASH - CRANE - UNDERCRANKED               43

      His eyes open.  They stare blankly up at the sky.  Then
      fear registers and we CRANE BACK QUICKLY, revealing a
      vast area of empty woods around Ash.


44    MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     44

      He sits up slowly into frame, looking fearfully about.

      All is peaceful.  The sound of birds tweeting.

                              ASH (V.O.)
               It's gone.

      He looks up to the sky.

               Sun's driven it away...

      the CAMERA.

      A perfectly normal log cabin with one exception;
      superimposed over the front of the place is...

      MITCHELL CAMERA

      A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare
      out at us with evil malice.  The eyes stare out from
      the two dark windows.  The dark nose area is the open
      doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the
      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.
      Then it fades, leaving only the cabin.

      He shudders uncontrollably as he picks himself up from
      the mud.

      Ash MOVES INTO A CLOSE UP.  His eyes shift back and forth
      like a trapped animal as he looks about for a means of
      escape.  He spots something.


54    EXT. CABIN - DAY - ASH'S POV                          54

      He shifts his glance from the car to the road.


56    EXT. ROAD - DRIVEWAY TO CABIN - DAY                   56

      A narrow dirt road cutting through the woods. Then,
      the Delta 88 roars down it, and past the CAMERA.  It
      kicks up dust and gravel.


57    INT. DELTA 88 - DAY                                   57
      (CAR MOUNT)

      Ash is driving.  He wipes the mud and blood from his
      face with a rag.  As he pulls the rag away, his face
      forms a sudden look of horror as he sees:


58    EXT. BRIDGE - DAY (STUDIO MINIATURE W/BACKDROP)       58
      CAR'S POV - TRACKING SHOT - STOP MOTION ANIMATION

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted
      remains of the steel and wood bridge that crossed
      a great mountain chasm.  A LOUD SCREECH of brakes
      is heard on the soundtrack on this cut.

      He looks at the bridge.


60    EXT. BRIDGE - DAY (STUDIO MINIATURE W/BACKDROP)       60
      ASH'S POV - BRIDGE

      A sign hangs from the twisted girders.  It reads:
      "DANGEROUS BRIDGE - 2 TON WEIGHT LIMIT - CROSS AT OWN
      RISK."  Beyond this we see the twisted remnants of the
      former bridge and the rock cliffs far away on the other
      side.

      He looks from the bridge to the West.

      The sun is now resting on the horizon.  Lower than it was
      before.  It is BLOOD RED, and sets in the course of seven
      seconds.

      To reveal Ash as he looks from the sunset, to the ruined
      bridge, to the road behind him.  He moves in halting
      steps, not knowing which way to turn.

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as
      he begins to scream, we CUT TO:

      3 CAMERAS - BREAKAWAY TREES

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      within the car throughout the chase to follow.

      Looking through the windshield, as branches beat and
      smash themselves against the windshield, obscuring
      our vision of the "Road" ahead.  Our view suddenly
      clears, revealing a large tree that looms directly
      ahead.

76A   ANGLE - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                           76A

      As he runs toward the cabin.  (Actually he is running
      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      It approaches the rear of the Delta, rips through the

      still blasting, and bursts out the remains of the front
      windshield.  We move through the steam of the radiator
      and approach Ash as he runs for the cabin.


78    CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      78

      We race into the cabin, splintering the hall door
      which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the
      rear hallway, and swings the hallway door shut.  We race
      right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces
      as we glide forward.

      Camera moves through the main room and up to the

      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      A static shot of a closet with it's door half open.

      a rack of clothes inside.  We hold on this for a
      moment.


85B   ANGLE - CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT       85B

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin
      to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze
      that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down
      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of
      the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is
      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that
      slight space between the trap door and the floor we
      see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes
      a sigh of relief.

      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CHEVROLET CAR TRUNK

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.


152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          152

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      As he stands and moves cautiously towards the rear
      bedroom.


154   ASH'S POV - MIDDLE ROOM AND REAR BEDROOM              154

      As he approaches the rear bedroom, the music grows louder.
      As he enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden
      piano.


155   INT. CABIN/REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                       155
      MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody.
      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.


157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR                       157

      As steam spouts from the radiator pipes.  As the piano
      keys depress and release themselves.  The melody grows
      louder.


158   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      158

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      As they rip open, splintering Ash's reinforcements.
      Wind sweeps in through the place as the curtains flutter
      wildly.  Through the window is a sweeping fog.


162   INT. CABIN MIDDLE ROOM - NIGHT                        162

      Ash runs through this room and into the main room.  He
      moves to the window and looks out.  Wind blowing on his
      face from outside.

      The tiny figure of Ash can be seen looking off toward
      this hill.  In the foreground is a crude burial cross
      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its
      feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the
      night air.

      (MINIATURE/STOP MOTION/REAR SCREEN) - 3 ANGLES

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates
      itself atop Linda's neck, she begins to spin, yet her
      head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash.
      With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the
      evening mists.

      Linda swings sharply into frame, completing the spin
      of her dance immediately in front of Ash as the music
      abruptly halts.

                              LINDA
               DANCE WITH ME!

      Linda extends her dead arms towards Ash.

      As he screams himself awake.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
      him sitting in the rocking chair.  Ash halts his scream,
      getting control of himself.  He looks to the window that
      had blown open.

               That's all.  Just a crummy dr-

      Linda's decapitated head falls into frame and lands in
      Ash's hands.


180   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             180

               Hello lover, I came from the other
               side of your dream to dance with you.


181   CLOSER SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD (BACKWARD MOTION)          181

      A four foot long blackened tongue emerges from her mouth
      like a lashing serpent.

      The tongue enters Ash's frame and forces itself into

      former love.  The tongue instantly retracts inside her
      head.

      cabin and towards the work shed; Linda's head still
      clamped to his hand.


187   INT. WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash
      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.  It is a room
      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.


187A  MEDIUM SHOT - INT. WORK SHED - ASH                    187A

      As he places Linda's head within the vice and
      tightens it around her, then withdraws his hand.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               Even now we have your darling Linda's
               soul!  She suffers in torment!


187B  CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               187B

      As it rips away an old tarp revealing the chalk
      outline of where a chainsaw once was.


187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the
      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts
      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.


187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D

      Ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it

      The crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a
      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.


187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.


187G  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187G

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.

      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.

      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.

      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      Wind and fog swirl about the place.  Ash's ECHOING
      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      The hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over
      Ash's head.  Then a bottle.


209   MEDIUM SHOT                                           209

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.


212   CLOSE-SHOT - HAND                                     212

      It digs its nails deep into the floorboards and begins to
      pull...


213   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     213

      ... as he is pulled along the kitchen floor.


214   CLOSE SHOT - HAND - GELETIN HAND                      214

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE
               Excuse me.  This the road to the
               Knowby's cabin?

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.

               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".

250   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      250

      Ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun.
      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

254   ASH'S POV - WALL - SQUIB                              254

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.


261A  INSERT ASH'S FINGER PULLS THE FIRST, THEN             261A
      SECOND TRIGGER


261B  INSERT FLAME BELCHES FROM THE GUN TWICE               261B


262   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      262

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      Ash opens the front door.  It slowly swings inward
      with a creak revealing the empty night.


283   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND JAKE                            283

      Ash approaches the front porch as Jake enters sharply
      into his frame.  Jake tackles Ash.

      Ed enters and holds Ash down as Jake slugs him twice.
      Ash's fist comes up into frame catching Jake on the
      jaw.  Jake pulls back his fist and rockets a piledriver
      blow to Ash's face, knocking him senseless.

      Joe's coat.  Bobby Joe is wounded from the shotgun blast.
      She holds her shoulder where the shell has grazed her.

                              JAKE
               You gonna be alright, honey?

                              BOBBY JOE

                              JAKE
               You know this son of a bitch?

                              ED

      Annie steps forward.

                              ANNIE
               Oh my God.  Where are my parents?

      Annie sets down the glass case containing the pages
      of the Book of the Dead.

                              ANNIE
               What the hell did you do to them?

      Nursing his sore knuckles, he points with his elbow
      to the trap door that leads to the cellar.

               We'll throw him in there.

      with Jake.

               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

                              PROFESSOR KNOWBY
                         (Voice on Tape)

      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               in here.

                              ANNIE
               Mother?

               No.  No.  I don't know what you

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      Ash exits the frame and we are left with Annie and the
      stark shadow of possessed Ed which is cast upon the
      wall behind her.  We watch as the shadow of Ash with the
      axe, slices through the top portion of possessed Ed's
      head.  Annie screams as she is splattered with green
      bile.

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      Jake slowly stands into the empty frame. He is in shock
      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into
      frame - shaking her head in a silent "No." Ash slowly
      rises into frame, terrified. They are looking down at
      the out-of-frame remains of possessed Ed.

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

               That's funny.

                              BOBBY JOE

               That trail we came in here on...
               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      She runs deep into the woods, still looking behind her
      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its
      gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized
      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

                              TREE FACE
               BAHHHH!

               her!

                              ASH
               If she went out in those woods,
               she's not coming back.

      Jake turns back to the window.  Ash turns to Annie.
      He glances down at the pages that Annie is looking over.

               What is it?

                              ASH
               Felt like someone just walked over my
               grave.  It's that picture.

      Annie looks to it.

               In 1300 AD.  This was the "Hero from
               the Sky," who was prophesized to destroy
               this Evil.

                              ASH
               He didn't do a very good job.
               What about the passages?

               Here it is.  Two passages.

      For the first time, she smiles at Ash.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

               find her, we're gettin' the hell

                              ASH
               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

                              JAKE
               You two comin' with me.  I ain't goin'
               out there alone.

               NO, YOU IDIOT.  You'll kill us all.
               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

                              JAKE
               'Sides.  Now you ain't got no, choice.

      Jake pushes at Ash with the barrel of the shotgun.

      the monster that is Ash emerges.  He heads toward the
      cabin and disappears in a bank of fog.

      Annie enters the room.  She shudders from the
      cold.  CAMERA PANS with her glance to broken glass
      upon the floor, and over to reveal the bashed out
      window and the curtains fluttering in the wind.


509F  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE                                   509F

      With her back toward us she doesn't notice Ash's hand
      appear suddenly in the foreground atop the writing desk.

514   ASH'S POV - STAR FILTER - MIRROR NECKLACE             514

      The NECKLACE of Linda.


517   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            517

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

      As he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace.
      He raises it to his face;

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      Ash raises his head and lets out a low, lamenting, and
      pitiful wail.  A man trapped in the shell of a beast,
      crying for the one he has lost.


520   MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH - 50% POSSESSED     520

      BLADDER EFX - 50 - 20% POSSESSED

      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The
      swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal.

      again human.  Ash looks up suddenly with a start.


524   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                   524
      EXPLODING FLOOR

      As he rolls out of the way a moment before the head of
      the axe buries itself in the wooden floor.  Splinters
      fly.


525   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                   525
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Rolls to his feet and stands.  He ducks as Annie
      enters frame, charging him with axe, screaming.

                              ASH
               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.


526   CLOSER - ASH AND ANNIE                                526

      Ash grabs her tightly with his remaining hand.

                              ASH
               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.


527   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - WOODEN AXE HEAD                    527
      EXPLODING WALL EFX

      Catching his wind for a moment.  Then rolls to the
      side as the axe again comes at him!  SLAM!  The head
      of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from
      his head.


528   MED. SHOT - ASH AND ANNIE                             528

      backwards.

                              ASH
               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH
               You'll be the first to know.
               I'm fine.


529   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE AND ASH                            529

               Yeah, but for how long?
               If we're going to beat this thing,
               we need those pages.

      As he turns to the trap door.

               Then let's head down into that cellar...


529B  CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR                                529B

      It lies silently against the floor.  A rasping
      breath can be heard from below.


529C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      529C

      He turns from the trap door to Annie.

               ...And carve ourselves a witch.

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

      Looking down into the cellar.  No sign of Henrietta.
      The bottom of the steps disappear into blackness.

                              ASH
               Those pages are down there
               somewhere.

      Ash arrives at the bottom of the steps.
      He looks about the dark corners of the cellar trying
      to find some sign of Henrietta or the pages.

      Panning the cobwebs and dark stone walls of the cellar.
      Half hidden in the shadows we see two of the missing
      pages.

      spots another page somewhat deeper into the cellar.


575B  ASH'S POV                                             575B

      A fourth and fifth page lay upon the earthen floor, at
      the base of the cellar's rear door.


575C  ASH - CLOSE SHOT                                      575C

      Ash moves to pages and gathers them.

      Annie's voice calls down.

                              ANNIE (O.S.)
               Did you find her?


576   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      576

                              ASH
               She's playing hard to get...

      He pumps the throttle on the buzzing saw.

                              ASH
               ... rid of.

      Behind Ash, unseen by him, a shadow darts by.


577   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      577

577B  ANGLE - ASH                                           577B

      He reaches for the door and opens it.  Revealing
      darkness beyond.  Ash enters.  Again he hears the slight
      sound, a gentle ticking.


578   INT. CELLAR - REAR ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV           578

      The ticking sound is coming from behind a hanging drape.


579   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     579

      He approaches the drape, reaches out his hand and pulls
      it back sharply.  Revealing an old water heater, ticking
      and steaming.


579A  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     579A

      He breathes a sigh of relief as the half eaten skeleton
      torso of Ed falls atop him!  Ash screams and steps suddenly
      away.


579B  ASH'S POV                                             579B

      wrapped in the bloody sheet.

                              ASH
                         (In a whisper)
               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the
      remaining pages from the Book of the Dead.  Getting
      scared now, he backs into the cellar's front room.


579D  INT. CELLAR - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT - ASH                579D

      climbs the steps.


581   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET                               581

      As they climb. From behind the wooden steps, the
      horrible head of Henrietta appears.  Her two rotting hands
      grab at Ash's ankles.


582   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      582

      He looks down with a scream.

               Come to me.  Come to sweet
               Henrietta!

      Her face pulls back behind the cellar steps.  Her
      hands pull ASH's feet in after her.


584   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - CAMERA RIG                        584

      As Ash falls, he slams his jaw down upon the bottom
      step.

               Nos-feratos-allo-memnon-kanda!

      She puts aside the pages and glances up suddenly at

      moans, and looks towards the steps.


590   ASH'S POV - THE WOODEN STAIRCASE (REVERSE ACTION)     590

      As a cackling Henrietta appears where the bottom section

      As she kneels down at the trapdoor, about to call down
      to Ash when the witchlike figure of Henrietta floats
      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

                              HENRIETTA
               Free!  Free at last!

      is clutching at Annie's hair and laughing with a demonic
      malice, as she spins about the room in mid air.


594   CLOSE SHOT - TRAP DOOR - ANNIE'S FEET                 594

      Ash's bloodied arm slings itself over the edge of the

      As the pee wee Head transformation continues, Henrietta's
      neck grows, like a jack in the box.  It extends
      a solid five feet upward, so that her head is now
      looking down upon Ash baring its teeth.

604   MEDIUM SHOT - HENRIETTA'S HEAD AND ASH                604

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.


605   CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE                                    605

                              ASH
               Swallow this.

      He pulls the trigger.  BLAM!  Flame barks from the gun.

      They pull apart and look into each others eyes.  Annie

      LOUD BOOMING echoes throughout the cabin!  As though the

      balls.  The kitchen wall behind them buckles.

      Dust is falling about them.  The cabin walls are
      starting to break apart.  There is a tremendous "Voyage

      and Annie stagger for footing.

      on the surface of a giant oak is revealed, as it peeks
      in through the window at them.

               No!  I only completed the first of the

      The beast continues to flap its wings and fly about a
      moment before falling to a heap in the dust.

      As he looks to Ash.


691   MED. SHOT - WARRIORS                                  691

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END

                                         5/3/2004

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, 
               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut 
               and naive).

               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them.

                                     CHIEF
                         This is it.

                                     LANKY
                         Why did it have to be these caves...

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Is something wrong?

                                     LANKY
                              (to College Boy)
                         Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

               Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

               The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT." 

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's get that first barrel.

               The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS 
               bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.

               INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

               College Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first 
               barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         What's with the awkward silence?

                                     LANKY
                         You don't know?

               College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.

                                     CHIEF
                         Last winter, a man kidnapped a little 
                         girl and holed up in one of these 
                         caves. The cops had him pinned down 
                         and began to move in. This guy started 
                         shooting... but he wasn't aiming at 
                         the officers...
                              (getting closer)
                         ...he was firing at something inside.

               College Boy is rapt.

                                     CHIEF
                         When the dust cleared, all they found 
                         was the little girl's shoes.
                              (beat)
                         With the feet still in 'em.

               Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Ahh!!!

               Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The 
               two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Assholes.

                                     CHIEF
                         Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself 
                         when my boss pulled that one on me.

                                     LANKY
                         I went well beyond nearly.

               Then, a sound. All eyes turn.

                                     CHIEF
                         What was that?

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Once was plenty, fellas.

                                     CHIEF
                         Shhhh...

               As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

               Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A 
               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, 
               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around 
               her neck. She charges towards Chief.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Stop it right there! You will not 
                         rape Mother Nature one more day!

               Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

               In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.

                                     HIPPIE GROUP
                         Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't 
                         dump in her any-more/Mother Nature 
                         is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-
                         more...

               A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films 
               the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.  

                                     CHIEF
                         Take it easy! We have a permit!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (handing a document)
                         And we have an injunction from the 
                         State to prevent any dumping in these 
                         caverns! This is virgin land! The 
                         aqueducts in these caves bring 
                         drinking water to our families, and 
                         its piping provides drainage for our 
                         farms that enrich this barren land! 
                         And it won't be tainted by waste of 
                         any kind! Not now! Not ever!

               Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Fine, just back off!

               He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's roll... Now-now-now!

               Backing away, looking to Mean Green.

                                     CHIEF
                         How do you guys always know where 
                         we're going?

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (with a smirk)
                         I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

               Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Score one for the green team!!!

               The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a 
               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in 
               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their 
               truck and peel away.

                                     BEARDED CAMERAMAN
                         Hey, man, that was righteous, but I 
                         need a shot with the sign up.

               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves 
               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         We saved you today, ol' gal.

               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach 
               in the rock wall.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh, fuck!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Sister, why do you always swing for 
                         the fences?

                                     FUZZY
                              (eyeing breach)
                         It's okay, but I... I think I see 
                         something in there... something shiny.

               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The 
               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh my, it looks like diamonds!

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. 
               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles 
               forward.

               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Give me the keys!!!

               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing 
               both his arms.

               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She 
               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she 
               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her 
               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. 
               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. 
               The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. 
               As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               RUN from the crash over desolate prairie land...

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music 
               emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.

               A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle 
               on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER 
               TOY HAS TITS."

               A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from 
               the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BOZO

               LIFE EXPECTANCY: DEAD BY DAWN

               The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup 
               trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes 
               through the front entrance --

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well 
               over six foot five with frazzled black hair and olive skin.

               Talking with a thick Greek accent, he pleads into a pay phone.

               CLICK. The pay phone goes dead.

                                     COACH
                         Son of a --
                              (deep breath, soothing)
                         In with anger, out with love.

               Further into the bar, a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter 
               into an old jukebox, but he is instantly pushed away by Bozo.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: PARA

               LIFE EXPECTANCY: THEY WOULDN'T KILL A CRIPPLE... WOULD THEY?

               Bozo's tank-top reads, "ONLY COOL CHICKS CAN DO ME."

                                     PARA
                              (rolling away)
                         Hey...

                                     BOZO
                         Shut up, fag.

               Bozo punches in his selection. EDGY CAT (34, samurai pony 
               tail, don't you dare call him an alcoholic) stands by the 
               bar's POOL TABLE powdering his cue.

                                     EDGY CAT
                              (to Bozo)
                         You're late!

                                     BOZO
                         Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em!

               The CD spins and an 1980s heavy metal classic KICKS IN.

               Bozo, mouthing the lyrics, struts away.

               NOTE: Music plays over all the bar sequences.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We continue to run. Rapid breathing.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Beer Guy (kinda handsome... just kinda) sets a keg of beer 
               behind the bar. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BEER GUY 
               AGE: 32 
               OCCUPATION: BEER GUY/PART-TIME HOST AT RED LOBSTER 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WIMPS AND DORKS ARE THE FIRST TO GO... HE'S 
               BOTH

               He talks with BARTENDER (thinning hair, chiseled face, big 
               earring) who preps a drink.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I mean, we'd been together for so 
                         long and then... bang! She drops me. 
                         Since then, it's been like a damn 
                         country song: she's gone, the car's 
                         repossessed, and a father figure 
                         made a pass at me. I'm not saying I 
                         ever had it. But I have definitely 
                         lost it.
                              (beat)
                         Now I haul this swill from armpit to 
                         armpit. I used to be a model for 
                         Christ's sake.

               Coach has been eavesdropping on Beer Guy and approaches.

                                     COACH
                         For what, may I ask?

                                     BEER GUY
                         JC Penny. Spring wear.

               Beer Guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder 
               and delivering his "model" cheese smile.

                                     COACH
                         You know, Chach, catching you at 
                         this low point is pure serendipity.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Why is that?

                                     COACH
                         Because I take the rubble of man and 
                         build superstars. In my briefcase 
                         here is a doorway to a self-help 
                         sensation. Give me a minute, because 
                         I'd like to buy you a drink and change 
                         your life forever. I have a brochure --

                                     BARTENDER
                         Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets 
                         'round here. We stick to chemistry. 
                         And his drinks are on me.

               Bartender puts a shot in front of Beer Guy. Behind him, a 
               mounted DEER HEAD is prominently displayed. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BARTENDER 
               AGE: 50 
               OCCUPATION: BARTENDER 
               FUN FACT: SHOT 4 TIMES, STABBED 6 TIMES, BIT BY 1 SQUIRREL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: READY TO WEAR

               With Coach stumped, Bartender turns to Beer Guy.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Was that the last keg?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Yup, one keg of Beast for the 
                         basement, then the truck's dry.

                                     BARTENDER
                         If you're stayin', move the truck, 
                         boss gets pissed about you using 
                         primo parking.

               Beer Guy downs his shot and hoists the lone keg into the 
               waiting keg elevator.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Right, 'cause this joint's hopping.

               He hits a button and the keg slowly lowers to the basement.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We jump over a bush and crash in the dusty earth.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               A glass of beer slides down the bar. A hand GRABS it and 
               puts it on a tray. The woman is pretty though haggard, stained 
               apron and dirty blond hair. Freeze on her.

               NAME: TUFFY 
               AGE: 25 
               OCCUPATION: CAREER WAITRESS

               DUMPING OF MANURE... IN EX-HUSBAND'S CAR 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: BADASS-IN-WAITING

               Tuffy carries the tray toward a table. She passes a TV mounted 
               on the wall.

               ON TV: A NEWSCASTER, dressed in a coat and tie, talks.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...the search for the missing 
                         protesters will be further complicated 
                         by the unstable conditions of these 
                         deep tunnels. Thus far, no sign of 
                         life has been detected, yet town 
                         officials are still optimistic.

               Newscaster spins and an ECLIPSE GRAPHIC appears on screen.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         On a brighter note, or should I say 
                         a darker note, tomorrow's solar 
                         eclipse will bring out adults and 
                         children alike for a citywide fair 
                         of this metrological event. Stay 
                         tuned for our man on the street to 
                         take a closer look...

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Beer Guy pulls the keg from the elevator and places it next 
               to other kegs. A faint conversation brews behind a curtain. 
               BOSS MAN (paunchy, sweaty, ugly) and ROADIE (English accent, 
               light hair, leather skin, thin build) talk shop.

                                     BOSS MAN (O.S.)
                         Listen, bud. I got a load ready to 
                         move and your man's not here.

                                     ROADIE (O.S.)
                         He's coming. Relax. And if he doesn't 
                         show --

                                     BOSS MAN (O.S.)
                         We got a problem.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - We are trucking... labored breathing...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy moves to a table where ADULTERER (bushy mustache, 
               sweater vest, dress shirt) sits with TRAMPY (designer glasses, 
               hair pulled back, tight blue business suit, closet tramp). 

               Freeze on Trampy.

               NAME: TRAMPY 
               AGE: 19 
               OCCUPATION: BANK TELLER 
               MOTTO: THE SHORTER THE SKIRT, THE HIGHER THE RAISE 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: BETTER THAN ADULTERER

                                     TRAMPY
                         He said there was no reason I had to 
                         stay a teller and that if I did good 
                         work and didn't mess up, I could 
                         become an assistant manager within 
                         three years.
                              (pause)
                         Can you believe that?

                                     ADULTERER
                         That sounds great.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: ADULTERER 
               AGE: 36

               GENITALS: SHAVED 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WORSE THAN TRAMPY

               Adulterer reaches into his pocket to pay the tab, but he 
               inadvertently pulls out his hidden WEDDING RING.

                                     TRAMPY
                         That sounds like bullshit! I could 
                         be an assistant manager at The Lake 
                         Arrowhead Casino for knowing the 
                         fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty 
                         in three months...

               The damning wedding band falls and bounces. As it rolls, 
               Tuffy, Trampy and Adulterer watch.

               The ring stops, standing still on its side.

               Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver.

               Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Just bring the whole bottle.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to 
               a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, 
               brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise.

               Freeze on her.

               NAME: BELLE 
               AGE: 21 
               OCCUPATION: WAITRESS 
               GOAL: PLAY BELLE IN STAGE VERSION OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"  
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: SAME ODDS AS PLAYING BELLE IN STAGE VERSION 
               OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"

                                     BELLE
                         If I could made that kind of money, 
                         I'd be in Hollywood next week.

               Boss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the 
               rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her 
               teeth and moves to the staircase.

                                     TUFFY
                         'Round here, there are ways.

               Boss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze.

               Freeze on him.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool 
               table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That cash is gonna look much better 
                         in my pocket.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: mounted head)
                         Ya know, that deer only looks scared 
                         when you're in the room.

               Para rolls up behind Edgy.

                                     PARA
                         Excuse me, please.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Jesus!

               Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the 
               WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline.

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which 
               Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's all she wrote...

               SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball 
               ricochets away as intended.

               Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue 
               ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         What?!

                                     BOZO
                         Ohhh, now that's a rough one.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's motherfuckin' impossible!

                                     BOZO
                              (crude Oriental accent)
                         Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go 
                         again?

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Goddamn it! NO!

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, come on. Crape Diem!

               Bozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away 
               cursing to himself and moves to the bar.

               Roadie looks on, sipping a beer.

               Freeze on Roadie.

               Bozo HITS the table of GRANDPA (elderly, white hair, bushy 
               white mustache) and GRANDMA (curly white hair, glasses).

               Freeze on them.

                         Get outta here.

                                     BOZO
                              (mocking)
                         What's that? Wha'cha say? Huh?
                              (to Grandma)
                         How much for the whole night, Grandma?

                                     GRANDMA
                         You should be so lucky.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (re: his fists)
                         This one will stun ya, but this one 
                         will put ya to sleep.

                                     BOZO
                         Whoa!

               Bozo approaches OLD VET (52, long hair with bandanna, dirty 
               beard) HARLEY MOM, (45, bruiser, grizzled, tough as a saddle) 
               and DRUNK GUY at the bar. The sad trio toss peanut shells 
               into three nearby tall, fat peanut barrels.

                                     BOZO
                         You boys wanna try your luck at the 
                         loot?

               Harley mom is offended. Not a word from the others.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on, I'll even throw with my 
                         left hand.

               He turns in disappointment.

                                     BOZO
                         Nothin' but a bunch of butts and 
                         pussies in here!

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar is close -- we leap a ditch.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a tray full of drinks behind the bar.

                                     BELLE
                         Shit! Shit! Shit!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Don't sweat it, just clean it up 
                         before he's done.

               He points up to the second floor.

               INT. BAR -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy's son CODY (7, innocent, cute) sits on the floor 
               watching TV. Freeze on him.

               NAME: CODY

               Tuffy puts headphones over his ears.

                                     TUFFY
                         Keep these on, sweetheart.

                                     CODY
                         Mommy, I want Nemo.

                                     TUFFY
                         Mommy's working on it.

               Tuffy kisses him and then moves to an adjacent room.

               ADJACENT ROOM

               Tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her 
               breasts. She pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's get this over with.

               Boss Man walks up naked, except for red cowboy boots.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I love a woman with enthusiasm.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo walks to the middle of the room.

                                     BOZO
                         I got two hundred bucks says none of 
                         you can beat me!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey! Get quiet or get out.

                                     BOZO
                         C'mon guys --

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and --

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     BOZO
                         Gimme some ACTION --

               BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO 
               (30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass).

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks --

               MUSIC CUTS OUT

               Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue 
               denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK.

               He SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the 
               handles, securing them.

                                     HERO
                         Unless you people want to die you'll 
                         do what I say and you'll do it fast!

               Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You hold it right there, mister.

                                     HERO
                         A storm of hell's coming down on 
                         this place any minute!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Drop the canon!

               Hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender.

                                     HERO
                         I'm not armed now, just hear me out.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll drop you and not even think 
                         about it!

                                     HERO
                         Let me explain!

                                     BARTENDER
                         You got one second to --

               Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD 
               from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see.

                                     HERO
                         Take a good look and listen to me! 
                         There's at least a four of these 
                         things out there!

               Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full 
               of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal 
               head with spiked hair.

                                     HERO
                         I saw one of them tear up five men 
                         like they were corn on the cob!
                              (off silence, shock)
                         I don't know what they are. I don't 
                         know where they came from. All I do 
                         know is that these fuckers are fast, 
                         nasty, and hungry.

               The bar stares at him, slack-jawed.

                                     HERO
                         And they can fly. Not to mention 
                         they got claws like Ginsu knifes and 
                         more teeth than a chainsaw.

               The Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake, 
               Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, "THE JUDGE."

                                     HERO
                         They're like goddamn blood hungry 
                         biker tattoos come to life. They're 
                         clocking us. Right now. And we have 
                         to lock this bar down!
                              (moving around)
                         That means doors, windows, drains, 
                         and basements. We have to do it fast!

               Hero looks out the lone front window.

                                     HERO
                              (looks to Belle)
                         You! Get on that phone. Call the 
                         cops, National Guard, townies, whoever 
                         kicks ass and get 'em out here.

               Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar.

                                     HERO
                         Any questions?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who are you?

                                     HERO
                         I'm the hero --

               CRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS 
               Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling --

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as 
               he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS.

               MAIN BAR

               Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window.

               Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are 
               kicked open, splintering the propped up chair.

               HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly 
               hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks 
               up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides 
               the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, 
               securing them.

               BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside 
               sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

               She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table 
               attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

                                     HEROINE
                         HELP ME! SOMEBODY!

               Old Vet and Harley Mom rush to Heroine's aid. They raise the 
               table to cover the gaping hole. Heroine looks outside.

                                     HEROINE
                         GET DOWN!

               A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

               The table falls, pinning Heroine.

               JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well.

               He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender 
               grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back.

               Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV.

               Yanks out half of Trampy's hair.

               Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         I got you!

               Edgy Cat misses. Junior Beast sends him FLYING into a wall.

               BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting 
               lights instead. An errant shot destroys Edgy Cat's face.

               Para covers as Junior Beast RIPS the back of his wheelchair.

               Roadie WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies 
               across the room, landing in a metal ICE COOLER.

               Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

                                     BOZO
                         Got 'cha!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Shadows of THREE SHRIEKING BEASTS close in on the window...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bartender runs across the bar and SLAMS shut the thick wood 
               shutters. The Beasts HIT, cracking the middle.

               Roadie power lifts the table with Heroine and braces it 
               against the window for reinforcement, but a FURRY ARM busts 
               through and grabs the other half of Hero.

                                     HEROINE
                         Goddamn you!

               Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is 
               being devoured through the smallish hole.

               Heroine works a GOLD RING off of Hero's ring finger. The 
               feeding MOMMA BEAST'S head breaks in through the hole. It 
               grabs Heroine's left forearm.

               Bartender aims The Judge at the Beast...

                                     ROADIE
                         You'll hit her!

               Roadie KNOCKS The Judge up -- BLAM!

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's shotgun blast blows off another toe on Boss Man's 
               RIGHT FOOT. He cries out in agony. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken 
               chair into the ATTACKING MOMMA BEAST'S RIGHT EYE. The Beast 
               SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside.

               Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are 
               heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm.

               Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone.

               The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding 
               spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has 
               momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures the lid with a nearby 
               PADLOCK.

                                     BOZO
                         What the FUCK was that?

               Wild-eyed and with a trembling hand, Heroine pours herself a 
               shot from the bar. She downs it and takes a long breath.

                                     HEROINE
                         The jungle has a new king.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is it clear?!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is there a gun pointing at you?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Nah, I got the gun.

               Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His 
               foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? 
                         Who did it!?

               Belle and Bartender move to his aid.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' 
                         shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (motioning to Heroine)
                         Her fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         My husband...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?

                                     HEROINE
                         He's dead.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?
                              (noticing destruction)
                         What the hell happened down here?!

               Boss Man looks to Bozo.

                                     BOZO
                         I didn't do it! It was fuckin' 
                         monsters, asshole!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Jesus Christ on the cross... someone 
                         make sense.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy. We're surrounded by something 
                         the likes none of you have ever seen 
                         before. Some kind of animals. Real 
                         fast, volatile, predators. One went 
                         through three of your patrons like 
                         nothing.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         So, your dead hubby shot me twice, 
                         three of my customers have been eaten, 
                         and there are angry creatures outside?

                                     HEROINE
                         He only shot you once.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Huh?

                                     HEROINE
                              (re: Bartender)
                         He shot you the other time.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It was an accident. Sorry.

               Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA 
               BEAST'S HEAD on the bar.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Look at it!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fan-fuckin-tastic.

                                     TUFFY
                         My god... what is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         That's one piece of four problems.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Please elaborate.

                                     HEROINE
                         That head over there, that's the 
                         oldest of the bunch, looked like the 
                         Grandpa. We caught the little one, 
                         Junior, in the cooler there. As we've 
                         seen, what he lacks in size he more 
                         than makes up for in speed.

                                     BARTENDER
                         And the rest of 'em?

                                     HEROINE
                         Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are 
                         still outside.

               NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse 
               of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.

                                     HEROINE
                         The next one is taller, but all out 
                         of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves 
               and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.

                                     HEROINE (V.O.)
                         He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly 
                         just the same.

               INT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

               Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

                                     HEROINE
                         I just took the eye out of the mother. 
                         She calculates, guiding the attacks.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than 
               Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL 
               GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her 
               stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine taps her right eye.

                                     HEROINE
                         If you are face to face with her, 
                         dive left.

                                     ROADIE
                         And the last one is the --

                                     HEROINE
                         Father. The biggest, the strongest...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               A blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths agape.

                                     HEROINE
                         No sign of any weaknesses. No sign 
                         at all. He's an eating machine.

                                     COACH
                         Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck 
                         in.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's not it. Four are here, but 
                         there's three others... which I can't 
                         account for.

               Heroine eyes the room.

                                     HEROINE
                         We need to lock this place down. Is 
                         everyone in this room?

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh my god! My son! My SON!

               Tuffy races toward the staircase to the SECOND FLOOR.

                                     HEROINE
                         Wait!

               Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.

                                     TUFFY
                         Cody! Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming!

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop her!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved. 

                                     CODY
                         Mommy --

               Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt 
               to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? 
                         Mommy is never gonna let you go!

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's lock off this room.

                                     TUFFY
                              (moving to exit)
                         Never, ever, never. Never, ever, 
                         never, baby. I love you --

               SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS 
               Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING 
               ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere.

                                     TUFFY
                         NOOOOOOOO!

               Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa 
               Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

               Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast 
               projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender.

               Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the 
               wood shutters closed.

               Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, 
               to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's 
               bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.

                                     HEROINE
                         Damn it.

               MAIN BAR

               Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Oh god...

               He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of 
               the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what 
               happened. The horror hits home.

               Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

                                     COACH
                              (to Tuffy)
                         Are you --

               Heroine puts a hand up to silence Coach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Just let her be... please.
                              (beat)
                         Is that the only phone?

               Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic 
               and wires.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The back phone is wrecked, too.

               Trampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse.

                                     BELLE
                         This is really happening. I can't 
                         believe this is really happening.

               Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What'd you say?

                                     GRANDMA
                         I didn't say anything.

               Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa 
               Beast head at the end of the bar.

               Para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair.

               Belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming 
               from the wheelchair's back rest.

                                     PARA
                         Thank you, but I don't need any help --

                                     BELLE
                         What's this? A power magnet or 
                         something?

                                     PARA
                         No. It's nothing.

               Belle puts together his scam with a smirk.

                                     BELLE
                         I didn't peg you for a con man.

                                     PARA
                         Hey, it pays more than the couch.

                                     BELLE
                         Lots of stuff around here does.

               Trampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Here!

               The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Hey!

                                     ADULTERER
                         Back off!

               Beer Guy walks from behind the bar.

                                     BEER GUY
                         So, what now? Did those things leave?

                                     BOZO
                         Why don't you go check it out?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck no.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (into cell phone)
                         I have a signal! I have -- Diane? 
                         Diane listen to me... get the kids 
                         and get in the basement... do it 
                         right now...

               Trampy stares with grief in her eyes.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'll explain later. Not now! I'm at 
                         a bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT 
                         UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT, 
                         DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Damn 
                         it! I lost the signal!

               Adulterer looks at the phone a bit dazed.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get 
                         outta here! I gotta go! My wife... 
                         See my wife is alone... She could be 
                         in trouble. I GOTTA GO!

               He moves towards the front door. Heroine moves into his path.

                                     HEROINE
                         I wouldn't do that.

               Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to the chin, throat 
               and chest, flipping him to the floor. She pulls a KNIFE from 
               her belt buckle and has it under Adulterer's chin.

                                     HEROINE
                         You can risk your life, but not mine! 
                         My daughter's no more than twenty 
                         miles from here waiting for me. I 
                         have just as much reason to leave 
                         this place as you do. But I also 
                         know that if they're here, then 
                         they're not there yet.

               Adulterer squirms.

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Get the fuck off...

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me!?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes!

                                     HEROINE
                         Now pull that tough boy shit again 
                         and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!

               Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from 
               his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

                                     ADULTERER
                         You can't keep me here. This is 
                         bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is 
                         fucking BULLSHIT!

                                     HEROINE
                         We can't risk letting them in.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (trembling, pissed)
                         Right.

               Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald 
               Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

               At the bar, Bozo puts the TV back into place, he jiggles 
               with some wires in the back, bringing back the picture.

                                     BOZO
                         Anything?

                                     PARA
                         Yeah, you got it.

               The bar takes notice. Trampy, cell phone in hand, paws through 
               a phone book as she watches the broadcast.

                                     BELLE
                         See! This has to be isolated. That's 
                         a local broadcast.

               ON TV: The Newscaster reads the teleprompter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         And now, we head to our man on the 
                         scene with a live look at tomorrow's 
                         event in Red Mountain.

               Heroine eagerly looks on, moving closer to the TV.

                                     HEROINE
                         My daughter's in Red Mountain.

               ON TV: There is an awkward pause from the Newscaster. The 
               broadcast doesn't cut to the reporter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Can you hear us? Apparently we're 
                         having some technical difficulties...

               Heroine sinks in her skin.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Oh, there we go!

               ON TV: A REPORTER, in an even worse suit, stands in a field 
               with several people looking through telescopes.

                                     REPORTER
                         That's right, the crowds are lining 
                         up early to witness tomorrow's 
                         meteorological phenomenon.

               Heroine sighs a gust of relief.

                                     REPORTER
                         But always remember, don't look 
                         straight into the sun because a 
                         special filter is needed to avoid 
                         damaging your cornea.

               The Reporter beams.

                                     REPORTER
                         And we're all looking forward to it 
                         tomorrow. Back to you.

               In the studio, the Newscaster smirks.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Thank you. And in other news...

               Roadie points to the TV.

                                     ROADIE
                         That studio's local, we can call in.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I have a short wave radio upstairs.

               Trampy is already dialing on the cell.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I'm calling them... it's ringing!

                                     ROADIE
                         They'd have a police scanner.

                                     TRAMPY
                              (into cell)
                         Hello? Yes, we're at the United --

               ON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...it has been reported that the 
                         power outage --

               A Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The 
               bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast 
               cuts out, turning to static.

               Trampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh no! Oh fucking no!

               Heroine, tense, quells the rising panic.

                                     HEROINE
                         Keep it together! I came from the 
                         east. That studio is south of here. 
                         For all we know, north and west are 
                         okay.

                                     ROADIE
                         An associate of mine was coming in 
                         from the north, ain't heard a word 
                         from him in hours.

                                     HEROINE
                         So, that leaves the west.

               Tuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat.

                                     TUFFY
                         And Red Mountain. Your daughter.

               Heroine looks over, making eye contact.

                                     HEROINE
                         Right.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This is goddamn depressing.

               At the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the 
               double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I've got some tools and extra planks 
                         in the kitchen, if we're on the same 
                         page here.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's work.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               The last board is hammered into place as the survivors back 
               away from the now re-enforced bar.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We'll it ain't pretty...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         But its got teeth.

               BAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler.

                                     BOZO
                         I think it's hungry again.

                                     HEROINE
                         We have to kill it.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         Can you help?

               Boss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior 
               Beast goes wild, trying to get out.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fire in the hole!

               Bullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots.

               Casings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in.

                                     BOZO
                         I think we got --

               RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler GRABBING 
               Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps.

               Moving quick, Tuffy grabs The Judge from Bartender and shoves 
               the barrel into a hole.

               BLAM! Guts splatter. Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches 
               his breath and looks to Tuffy. She is born again, seething.

                                     TUFFY
                         You're welcome.

               She hands the shotgun back to Bartender.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Jesus, it took all that? All those 
                         bullets? How can we possibly fight 
                         off the others?

                                     HEROINE
                         Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears 
                         and mouth. From what I've seen, it's 
                         their only weakness.

                                     ROADIE
                              (looking at the corpse)
                         Looks like they're soft on the inside 
                         like any other animal. Trick is to 
                         get in there and do the damage.

                                     BELLE
                         Maybe we don't have to fight them.

                                     BOZO
                         Right, let's just call 'em names.

               Coach steps forward, poised to make the sale.

                                     COACH
                         Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have 
                         your attention.

               The bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty Greek man.

                                     COACH
                         We have to think outside the box 
                         here. We don't need to fight them, 
                         we need to scare them. Scare them 
                         right back. This is a species stand-
                         off. We just need to show them we're 
                         not vulnerable. That we're formidable.

                                     ADULTERER
                         How?

                                     COACH
                         I need a stick.

               Bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out 
               Junior Beast with salad tongs. It falls to the floor with a 
               SPLAT. Coach grabs a splintered broomstick.

                                     COACH
                         Stand back.

               He buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the 
               limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall.

                                     COACH
                         Let's get that board down.

               Roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole. 

                                     HEROINE
                         What are you doing?

               Coach shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside.

                                     COACH
                         Showing superiority. The scent of 
                         their dead may drive them away.

               The whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast 
               family will react. They look through SMALL HOLES, barely 
               able to see anything.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I don't see them.

                                     COACH
                         Come on. Come onnnnnn.

                                     BELLE
                         Is there a call, or something?

                                     BOZO
                         See that you monkey fucks! That's 
                         what you get when you mess with us! 
                         Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! 
                         Shit don't make me gay because you'll 
                         be sucking my dick!

               Bozo's insult hangs in the air.

                                     PARA
                         Sweet...

               P.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Coach jerks back. The startled group tries to focus, but 
               it's too dark outside. With the moon as the only light, Father 
               Beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child.

               Silhouettes of the other family members slowly approach 
               Junior. Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing.

                                     BEER GUY
                         It's working. I think it's working.

                                     COACH
                         You see? What I tell you?

               The whole group starts to ease. Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back, 
               covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens.  
               Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and 
               SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Adulterer's eyes widen.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Good christ! They're cannibals!

                                     COACH
                         Oh dear...

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               A steady "thud-thud-thud" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's 
               drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The 
               group maneuvers to get a better look.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh... my... god.

                                     PARA
                         What are they doing now?

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Yes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, they're humpin'!

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts 
               all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and 
               she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum 
               cleaner drops from her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Trampy VOMITS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               The slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring 
               appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS 
               have been born.

               Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The 
               Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine's eyes bulge.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get back!

               SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front.

               Roadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is 
               holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair.

                                     BOZO
                         Any more ideas, Animal Planet?

                                     COACH
                         I-I-I was just being proactive...

                                     BEER GUY
                              (to Bozo)
                         Hey, you weren't helpin'!

                                     BOZO
                         Go douche.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What the hell now?

                                     ADULTERER
                         We're stuck in here. That's what.

               Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair.

               Roadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hey, Miss?

               Heroine turns.

                                     ROADIE
                         If you don't mind me asking, how did 
                         you run into these things?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         More importantly, how did you run 
                         away from these things?

                                     HEROINE
                         Well, it all started about forty 
                         hours ago...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- EVENING

               The orange sun melts into the horizon.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero and his overweight friend TUBBS (35, hard living career 
               farm hand) laugh at a TV show while Heroine paces on the 
               telephone in the background.

                                     HEROINE
                              (into phone)
                         So, how is staying with Grandma 
                         working out? Ya know, if you stare 
                         into her glasses, you can see what 
                         cards she is holding. But I didn't 
                         tell you that.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               There's a home on the horizon with a big barn next to it.

               Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine starts to peek out of the window.

                                     HEROINE
                         Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, 
                         okay baby?

               The phone cuts out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hello? Charlie?

               Heroine and Hero look at each other with concern. Hero looks 
               out the window.

                                     HERO
                         Holy mother of...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine has the group mesmerized.

                                     HEROINE
                         We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. 
                         Then it was just listening. We heard 
                         those things destroy an entire heard 
                         of livestock. They just kept coming. 
                         Closer and closer, consuming anything 
                         in the way. Slashing, feeding and 
                         licking the bones clean. Just when 
                         we said our prayers, the first ray 
                         of sun hit the house...

               EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING

               PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls as Heroine and her companions 
               peek out from the damaged cellar door.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         That first beam of sunlight drove 
                         'em away. Somewhere. We called who 
                         we could and then decided to run for 
                         it. We didn't see a soul the whole 
                         drive out. When the tank went dry, 
                         we came upon a gas station to refill.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- LATE DAY

               The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO 
               pulls into a small gas station

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine goes up to the service window with Tubbs and looks 
               inside. Nobody. There is a slight BUZZING from inside.

               Hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car.

                                     HERO
                         What's goin' on? The pumps are off.

                                     TUBBS
                         There's nobody here --

               She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room. There 
               is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION 
               ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.

                                     HEROINE
                         They've been here!

                                     HERO
                         Turn on the pump!

               Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         We had no time. All we knew was the 
                         sun was dropping and we had to get 
                         enough fuel to make it through the 
                         night at 90 miles per hour...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Hero fills their Camaro.

                                     HERO
                         Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck 
                         it down.

               INT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tubbs hastily grabs food and drinks, ignoring 
               the cash register completely. The sun is setting.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         It happened fast...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop.

                                     HERO
                         Move it!

               Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts.

               Their loot hits the pavement as they run.

                                     HERO
                         Get in the car, baby.

               Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the 
               back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat.

               Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the 
               sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas 
               pool. Something rises in the gas station.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         That's when I saw three others... 
                         just for a second.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET

               Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows.

                                     HERO
                         Roll!

               Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the 
               station becomes a FIREBALL.

               INT. CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS

                                     HEROINE
                         Close the roof!

               Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof 
               as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car...

                                     HERO
                         Shit!

               Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, 
               reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel.

               The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into 
               darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road.

                                     HERO
                         We made it!

               Hero reaches back to give a "five" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't 
               respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering, 
               HEADLESS body in the back seat.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head.

                                     HEROINE
                         It must have smelled the blood or 
                         something. We buried the body and 
                         got back on the main road when...

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro.

               Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly 
               as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

                         Break!

               Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, 
               holding onto the grill.

                                     HERO
                         Go! Go! Go!

               Grandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as 
               sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel.

                                     HERO
                         Look out!

                         And that's how I ended up here.

                         And the head?

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast.

               His head FIRES through the windshield, landing on Heroine's 
               lap. Its snake-like tongue lashes out at Heroine's crotch.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         I don't want to talk about that.

                         So, your husband ditched you?

                                     HEROINE
                         No. It was wild out there. No time 
                         to think. We just moved. He didn't 
                         leave me. He just ran.

               Para wheels over to a COUNTY MAP on the side wall.

               Para stares intently at the map. Adulterer moves over to the 
               window that has shutters over it, peeking through a hole.

                         or something and only come out for a 
                         few days to feed. This could just be 
                         a part of their life cycle.

                         happen out of the blue.

               The room is silent. Bozo looks around, quickly moving towards 
               Grandpa and Grandma.

                         for everyone to take a role.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You gotta have some guns or weapons 
                         around here.

               Boss Man, pale and morphine pumped, sits at a table with his 
               foot raised.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I got my .38 here. That's six shots 
                         and two refills. Downstairs, I have 
                         locker with a sawed-off and some 
                         gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes 
                         of shells.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I got shells, too. Box and a half 
                         tops. Machete behind the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Okay, well that's something.

                                     ROADIE
                         So we've got guns, kitchen knives, 
                         pipes, fire and sticks.

               Beer Guy scans the stocked bar wall.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I might be able to do something with 
                         the bottles.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You're gonna need a whole lot more 
                         than that to get outta here alive.

               The crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, now you have something to say?

               Grandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You young'uns worry about weapons, 
                         I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh? And what's that?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Sit still, look less like a meal.

                                     BOZO
                         That's for bears and sharks, chunky 
                         chew.

               The group looks back to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright, what else do we have? Can 
                         we somehow contact the outside world?

               Trampy pensively stays on her fractured phone.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I can't get anybody. I don't even 
                         know if I have a signal anymore.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I have a CB in my truck, we could 
                         get some help out here.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who the hell would you call?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Anyone.

                                     BOZO
                         Do you drive a short beer bus or 
                         something? You go out there, you get 
                         eaten. You stay in here, you get 
                         eaten. Anyone comes to help, they 
                         get eaten. Don't you see a pattern 
                         here, Spuds Makenzie?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Then I guess we should just give up.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy)
                         Believe me, I'd love to save the day 
                         and get some heroic snatch, but it's 
                         not in the cards, partner.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You said you had a short wave radio.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Where?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Upstairs.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Go for it. It's by the far wall. 
                         Channel 9 is the emergency frequency.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. I'm heading to the basement 
                         for supplies.
                              (to Bozo)
                         And you're going upstairs.

               Bozo blinks. A little taken aback.

                                     BOZO
                         Let's not get carried away...

                                     HEROINE
                         Step up, Chief.

                                     BOZO
                         So that's how it is?
                              (hands out)
                         Fine! Shotgun, please.

               Bartender hands him The Judge.

                                     BOZO
                              (to Bartender)
                         You're coming with, portly. 'Cause 
                         if I'm attacked, I want a fat man 
                         close by.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll wait by the door.

                                     BOZO
                         Now who else is comin'?

               No one budges.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (rising from his seat)
                         I'll go with ya.

                                     BOZO
                         What are you gonna do? Throw your 
                         teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

               Bartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete.

               At the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in 
               very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants.

                                     BOZO
                         You! Zorba! You're coming too!
                              (to Heroine)
                         Now gimme the keys.

               Heroine tosses the keys to Bartender.

                                     HEROINE
                         No. You're locked in.

                                     BOZO
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         Those two will be on the other side 
                         waiting for you. If you become food, 
                         I don't want the only set of keys in 
                         the belly of one of those things.

                                     BOZO
                         Don't get your hopes up.

               Bozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and 
               it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow.

               Heroine turns to the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Any volunteers to head into the 
                         basement with me?

                                     TUFFY
                         I will.

               Tuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes, 
               looking tough and resolute.

                                     BEER GUY
                         That's not a good idea.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         With what happened upstairs --

                                     TUFFY
                         Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have 
                         no idea what is running through me 
                         right now. No idea.
                              (to Heroine)
                         I'm ready.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright.

                                     ROADIE
                         Count me in.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Me too.

               Heroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement. 
               The door creaks open slowly. The group descends.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and 
               pulls himself up the staircase like an old man.

                                     BOZO
                         Alright you two, I don't want to 
                         hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the 
                         key, wrong key, ain't no key here." 
                         When I want out, I want out, ok?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (displaying keys)
                         They're right here.

                                     COACH
                         We've got your back, bro.

               They unlock the door, swinging it open.

                                     BOZO
                         Just keep 'em handy, ladies.

               Bartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks.

                                     BOZO
                         Wish me luck...

               WHAM! Bozo is on the ground.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         I'm okay! I'm okay!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on. Come on. Come on.

               Bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from 
               Cody's attack. The TV illuminates the room.

                                     BOZO
                         Geeezzzus.
                              (moving gingerly)
                         Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. 
                         Easy steps.

               MAIN BAR

               Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         How are you holding up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well...

               He pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her.

                                     BELLE
                         What is this?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Morphine. My magic potion. I need a 
                         few drops.

               She puts a few drops on his out-stretched tongue.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You should try a little, it'll calm 
                         your nerves. Works like a charm.

                                     BELLE
                         No other time than now, right?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, before you do that, help me 
                         move. There's a small room off the 
                         kitchen where I can lay down.

                                     BELLE
                         But --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It's much safer in there. Trust me.

               BASEMENT

               The basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried 
               out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW 
               is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into 
               the dark corners.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay on your toes everybody.

               Tuffy tightly grips her weapon, ready to fire. Heroine kneels 
               next to a hatch door that emits a red glow.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's this?

               Roadie jams a pipe into the little door, bracing it shut.

                                     ROADIE
                         You don't need to know what that is.

               Beer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it.

                                     BEER GUY
                         There's a sawed-off shotgun in here.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach have their ears pressed to the door.

                                     COACH
                         Come on, bro.

               Behind them, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS 
               upward.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo moves turtle slow.

                                     BOZO
                         Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.

               He moves to the Boss Man's private room. He puts his hand 
               out to open it. Trembling, he touches the knob and...

               CREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the 
               room. He moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain. A bat 
               FLIES off the lamp shade SCREECHING. Bozo falls backwards.

                                     BOZO
                         HAAAA!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach jump back.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants.

                                     BOZO
                         Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         If he doesn't shut up...

                                     COACH
                         He is human kabob.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, 
               kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation.

               Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair.

                                     BELLE
                         Doesn't your foot hurt?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I can't feel a thing, Hon.

                                     BELLE
                              (touching his crotch)
                         How 'bout now?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You're a bad girl, aren't you.

               Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes.

                                     BELLE
                         Um-hmmm.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         The girl's got rhythm.

               She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts 
               up her skirt and bends over, giggling.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         There it is.

               BASEMENT

               Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor.

                                     ROADIE
                         This is all junk.

               Beer Guy holds a rusted machete.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This could come in handy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's get everything upstairs.

               Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by 
               the arm and takes her aside.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry, I'm fine. Really.

                                     HEROINE
                         I admire your strength.

                                     TUFFY
                         Trust me, I plan on having a full 
                         breakdown when this is over, but for 
                         now, we all have to be strong, right?

               Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL 
               LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a 
               LITTLE GIRL.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is my daughter, Charlie. She's 
                         all I'm after.

                                     TUFFY
                              (fighting back tears)
                         Oh...

                                     HEROINE
                         And I'm gonna need your strength, 
                         every bit of it.

                                     TUFFY
                         You have it.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. But still do me a favor.

                                     TUFFY
                         Name it.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with a wink)
                         Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.

                                     TUFFY
                              (tiny smile)
                         Deal.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the 
               CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He 
               drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs.

                                     BOZO
                         Hello? Anyone there? We need help 
                         out here at the United Nations Tavern. 
                         Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 
                         10-4. S.O.S.

               All he gets is static. A faint GROWL is heard outside. OUTSIDE 
               THE DOOR Bartender hears the growl, his eyes grow wide.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her 
               tongue at Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         You wanna see, baby?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hell yeah.

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         How much I got, what?

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got to see the show?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You don't understand, sweety. Daddy 
                         doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for 
                         free. But you do get points for being 
                         horny on a night like this.

               She cringes and backs up a little.

                                     BELLE
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You can't expect a man to buy a car 
                         without a test drive first, can you?

                                     BELLE
                         Um, hmm --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Now wiggle that sweet little ass 
                         over here and sit on Daddy's face, I 
                         wanna do some appraising.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo barks into the CB.

                                     BOZO
                         Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling 
                         all cars! Calling all cars! We need 
                         help at the United Nations Tav --

               The CB is JERKED from Bozo's hands and slams into the wall.

                                     BOZO
                         Shit!

               Bozo aims the gun at the wall. Chewing sounds begin.

                                     BOZO
                         Double shit!

               He backs up to the door.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         Okay, I'm ready to come out now!

               Bartender confidently turns the key. CLICK! It breaks off in 
               the lock.

                                     BARTENDER

                         mean?

               Bozo knocks on the door hard.

                                     BOZO
                         HEY! OPEN IT!!!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender looks to Coach.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Wha?

               A thunderous CRASH! Boards fly off the wall.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle, hearing the crash, jerks back from Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         What was that?

               CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 punch through the 
               tiny wall fan and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED 
               against the wall.

               She's slammed against it repeatedly and then -- RIP! Belle's 
               skin is TORN from her head and torso. Boss Man jumps back.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!

               Belle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         NO! NO! NO!

               Boss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall.

               Sister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine and the others, just returning from the basement, 
               hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Coach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock, trying to 
               use his fingernails to turn the metal stump.

                                     COACH

               Bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the 
               Momma and Papa Beast chomping at the wall.

               Boss Man uses the cot to block the Sister Beasts from 
               entering. They hiss and shred the cot fabric.

                                     BOSS MAN

               Boss Man crawls for the door. Sister Beast #1 fires out a

               in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot.

               Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort.

               Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

               Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his 
               shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin.

               The door flies open. Bozo is YANKED to safety just as Papa

                                     BOZO
                         I got Papa in the stones.
                              (beat)
                         He's neutered.

                                     PARA
                         Whoa... good one...

                                     ROADIE
                         That back room is sealed shut.

               Heroine glares at Boss Man.

                                     HEROINE
                         I told you to stay in the main room.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Yeah... I will. I will. Promise.

               Coach eyes the group, this is his time to shine.

                                     COACH
                              (rising, full of brawn)
                         If they can't reproduce anymore -- 
                         we are one step closer! A big step! 
                         Now is the time to band together. We 
                         need to rise up against these monsters 
                         of the night! Those creatures are no 
                         match for the human spirit! We can 
                         do it! We just need to believe in 
                         each other! In all of us! We need to 
                         make a stand! Right here! Right now!

               Long silence. Bozo stares.

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, are you gay?

               Coach sits down, humbled.

                                     HEROINE
                         We know what not to do. We must stay 
                         focused and together. The beasts 
                         will find a breach. We gotta find a 
                         way out before they find a way in.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's run for the cars, cause mass 
                         confusion.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The lot's too damn far, that's 
                         surefire suicide.

               The room is silent. Bartender motions to Boss Man, but he is 
               promptly shushed by Boss Man. Heroine notices.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         You know what.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I don't know shit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Roadie)
                         You. What was that door downstairs?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, wait, wait.

               Heroine glares at Roadie.

                                     HEROINE
                         Don't bullshit me.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It's a tunnel.

               Roadie nods, causing Boss Man to sigh.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It runs about a hundred yards and 
                         spits out on the backside of that 
                         hill down the way.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for?

               They clam up.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for!?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Grass, man. I grow pot down there.

                                     HEROINE
                         Does the tunnel spit out near a car?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It spits out behind the parking lot.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My truck is near, but it ain't nearly 
                         big enough to haul the whole lot.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's a shot. Is it gassed up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fully.

                                     HEROINE
                         Four door?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Two.

                                     HEROINE
                         How many can it hold?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Six.

                                     HEROINE
                         Max?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Seven.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's gonna fit thirteen.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with hand out)
                         Keys.

                                     ROADIE
                         What're you planning?

                                     HEROINE
                         Three of us go. Two to defend, one 
                         to drive. We back up to the bar and 
                         then tear ass out of here.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Sounds sketchy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let me make this clear; if we stay, 
                         we die.

               Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string 
               around his neck.

                                     ROADIE
                         Give 'em to me, I'm going.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You're trusting that con? He'll ditch 
                         us and never look back.

                                     ROADIE
                         Fuck you too.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Get in line!

                                     HEROINE
                         Hey! I'm not trusting him either, 
                         that's why I'm going with.

               Coach stands forward.

                                     COACH
                         "Courage is being scared to death, 
                         but saddling up anyway."
                              (off blank stares)
                         The Duke. I will go.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is it. They have this place 
                         surrounded, but if we go under them 
                         we might just make it.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This is a bottleneck waiting to 
                         happen.

               SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass.

                                     BOZO
                         This one's great under pressure. I 
                         wish you luck.

                                     HEROINE
                         The rest of you prepare the weapons, 
                         whatever you got left. 'Cause when 
                         we crash through those walls, we're 
                         bringin' death with us.

               Heroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach.

                                     COACH
                         No, I don't believe in guns.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This ain't time for a political 
                         stance.

               Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy.

                                     COACH
                         This doesn't run out of ammo.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Got ya.

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey!

               The three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod.

                                     BOZO
                         When you get to that truck... drive 
                         it like you stole it.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               At a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye.

                                     TRAMPY
                         How does it feel?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Lousy.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You still have one left.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes, the silver lining.

                                     TRAMPY
                         It serves you right for cheating.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Spare me.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I figure it's karma. You wronged me 
                         and you wronged your wife, so this 
                         is karma biting you on the ass, or 
                         in your case... in the eye.

               Bozo moves close, surveying the bandage work.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh yeah?

                                     TRAMPY
                         It could be worse, you could be dead. 
                         Then again, the climax is upon us.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy's hair)
                         Ya know, that's not a bad look on 
                         you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd 
                         hook it up.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

                                     BOZO
                         Tease.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Leave her alone.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet 
                         contest... starting now.

               Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy.

                                     BOZO
                         Ya know, in situations of duress, I 
                         have found that women are attracted 
                         to my authority.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach make their way through the 
               basement. Creeks and cracks with every step.

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Heroine)
                         You handle yourself pretty well. You 
                         a cop or a criminal?

                                     HEROINE
                         Neither. Just a farmer.

                                     ROADIE
                         Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?

                                     HEROINE
                         I just think about my husband and 
                         daughter... and the rest is easy.

               The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

               Roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed-off barrel.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy.

               WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook. 
               They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door.

               Heroine scans the room.

                                     ROADIE
                         This place is creepy in the daytime, 
                         too. Ready?

               Coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.

                                     ROADIE
                         Scared?

                                     COACH
                         No. You?

                                     ROADIE
                         Of course not. I fight monsters all 
                         the time.
                              (gripping the door)
                         On three.

               Roadie, Heroine raise their weapons.

                                     COACH
                         One... two... three!!!

               Roadie whips open the door. Nothing.

               BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them... 
               they jump, but nothing is there. A LITTLE MOUSE emerges from 
               the fallen heap.

                                     COACH
                         Well, look at that.

               Coach leans down and puts out his hand. He smiles as Heroine 
               watches over his shoulder.

                                     COACH
                         Hey, little fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's go.

               He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

               SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

               A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. They all 
               drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.

                                     COACH
                         Looks like a brothel for plants.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for 
               movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

               Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

                                     BOZO

               Bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry 
               red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh 
               marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick 
               pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering 
               system. There is about six inches of water on the floor.

                         accents. We both travel a lot. We 
                         both don't really have homes...

                         Quiet.

               Coach bites his lip, dying to say something.

                                     COACH
                         It's just that this seems like the 
                         opportune time for someone to be 
                         horribly... offed.

               Bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles.

                                     BOZO
                         You don't want the rag touching booze, 
                         that way you can hold it and ensure 
                         it explodes when you throw it.

                                     BOZO
                         I'm sure.

               Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer.

                                     BOZO
                         Perfecto. What we should do, though, 
                         is put those peanut barrels to use. 
                         Fill 'em with booze and line up some 
                         planks. If the walls come down... we 
                         hit 'em Donkey Kong style.

               Para and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect

                         You aren't nearly as dumb as you

                         Next time, look within. Stereotyping 
                         can be ugly and hurtful.

               Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder.

                                     BOZO
                         Excuse me for being forward, but I'm 
                         curious about your dimensions.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The 
               tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hold up. You hear something?

               A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above.

                                     ROADIE
                         They're trying to burrow through the 
                         tunnel walls.

                                     HEROINE
                         Move.

               The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end 
               of the tunnel as well.

                                     COACH
                         Like moles these things.

               Then, Sister Beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far 
               end.

               She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her.

                                     ROADIE
                         Duck!

               Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable 
               to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister 
               Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims 
               his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his 
               shot.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay down!

               From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three 
               shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered 
               in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.

                                     HEROINE
                         Go! The bitch is mine!

               Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend 
               with the Beast.

               Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.

               Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding 
               the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth 
               with the gun, knocking her back.

               Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.

               Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others.

                                     HEROINE
                         Look out!

               Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through 
               the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks.

               Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.

                                     ROADIE
                         The shells are wet!

               With the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach 
               looks around, seeing a plan.

                                     COACH
                         Grab onto ceiling and get out of 
                         water!

                                     ROADIE
                         What?

                                     COACH
                         Do it!!!

               Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls 
               himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power 
               cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end.

                                     COACH
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get out of water!!!

               Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came.

               As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the 
               water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait 
               for Heroine to get out of the water.

               The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.

               ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister 
               Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke 
               rises from their cooked bodies.

               Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin 
               shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.

               INT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters 
               the basement.

               GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the 
               floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. 
               Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill.

               Heroine raises her weapon.

                                     HEROINE
                         You fuck with my family. 
                              (aiming shotgun)
                         I fuck right back!

               Click -- out of ammo!

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh shit.

               Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE.

               She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers.

               She swings again but gets whacked to the floor.

               Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives 
               into the KEG ELEVATOR.

               She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure 
               and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit.

                         If there's anybody left.

               The two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above.

               At the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two 
               men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Heroine wedges the door closed. The Beast continues to try 
               to get in. Heroine bangs the top of the small elevator...

               Beer Guy hits the button. The gears grind and start to pull 
               the elevator up to the main floor.

               As Teen Beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg 
               elevator in the shaft, Heroine pounds and tears at the few 
               planks above her in the keg elevator.

               Teen Beast BITES through the floor board of the keg elevator.

               CLANGGG! The elevator stops. Heroine lurches and grabs the

               Tuffy moves for the keg door. Adulterer grabs The Judge from 
               Bartender.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Heroine almost has the primary cable cut. Teen Beast rises 
               up to bite.

               SNAP!! The cable BREAKS. Heroine SOARS up the shaft. Teen 
               Beast is pulled down to the bottom. The keg elevator door 
               bursts open on impact.

               Heroine SLAMS into the ceiling, kicking and yelling.

               Tuffy KNOCKS Adulterer's shotgun up, takes the gun, and rips 
               open the keg door. Heroine swings out.

               P.O.V. - Teen Beast is right behind her with mouth open and 
               ready to feed. Tuffy points her shotgun.

               BLAM! Teen lurches back, dropping back down the shaft.

               Tuffy slams the keg door shut. Heroine pants on the floor.

               Adulterer is down, winded.

                         You okay?

                                     HEROINE
                         I think they made it.

               She turns to Adulterer, rigid.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop trying to get people killed. It 
                         is getting very old.

               Adulterer nods, ashamed. Heroine looks around the bar. She 
               notices the peanut barrels on top of the bar. Two wooden 
               planks serve as track, leading straight for the side wall.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's this?

                         I have two left.

               Bartender expels a shell from The Judge and hands it over.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Make it count.

               Heroine cringes, eyeing the lined up Molotov cocktails.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's prepare ourselves, they ought 
                         to be here with the truck any minute.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Bullshit.

               Boss Man sips a bottle, still hopped-up on morphine. He lazily 
               loads his pistol from a pool of bullets on his belly.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay 
                         right here, wait for sunrise, then 
                         walk on out of here.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's your choice, but this is going 
                         to get a whole lot worse before it 
                         gets any better.

               Boss Man shrugs, content with himself.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         If all of you run for it, they won't 
                         care about lil ol' me. They like the 
                         food that moves...

               CRASH! Teen Beast's arm ERUPTS through the Boss Man's belly.

               His pistol and bullets scatter across the floor.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         OHHH!!!

               SNAPPP!!! His head and legs SLAP together as the arm pulls 
               him through a small hole in the floor.

               The group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed 
               down the tiny hole.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get on the tables!!! On the tables!!!

               Everyone struggles to get on the tables.

               CRASH! Teen Beast's arm reaches up and GRABS Para's 
               wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor.

               Teen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg...

                                     PARA
                         HELP ME!!!

                         Bonsai!

               Bozo jumps from a table and STOMPS on Teen Beast's arm. He 
               picks up Para and TOSSES him onto a table.

                                     BOZO
                         Hot potato!!!

               Bozo leaps back onto a table. POP! The power cuts out. The 
               room goes black.

                                     BEER GUY
                         We're gonna die!

                                     ADULTERER
                         What the hell?!

                                     HEROINE
                         Settle down!

                                     TRAMPY
                         Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

               And with that, the shouting and pounding stops. The group 
               nervously shuffles around the tables.

               There's silence.

               Dead silence.

               Then, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard. 
               It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors 
               maneuver to peek out the front walls.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What's that?

               Tuffy sees what is coming.

                                     TUFFY
                         They didn't make it.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Being held by Papa and Momma Beast, Roadie and Coach are 
               both rushed towards the wall like human battering rams.

                                     ROADIE
                         RUN!!!

               THUD! The first strike causes the men to HOWL.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the 
               walls, they can hear high-pitched SCREAMS.

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood 
               spits through the planks of wood.

                                     BARTENDER
                         That wall's coming down!

                                     BOZO
                         Commence Plan B!

               The entire group goes into motion.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's Plan B?

                                     BOZO
                         Just watch the floor and keep the 
                         others safe!

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood 
               planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses.

                                     BOZO
                         Bomb's away!!!

               From the bar, Beer Guy, Tuffy, and Adulterer release the 
               first peanut barrel. It's ablaze and sails straight for Papa 
               Beast. BLAM! It explodes, bursting open the wall and knocking 
               back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame.

               Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 
               from the floor.

               The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the 
               breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts 
               stay far away.

               Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's 
               table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to 
               the floor.

               Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, 
               moves in to feed.

               Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and 
               flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power 
               magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just 
               as Teen Beast strikes...

               POP! The shot hits Teen Beast in the eye, sending him back 
               down the hole in the floor.

               Heroine and Bartender move in. When Teen Beast sticks his 
               head out of the hole again, they thrust both their shotguns 
               into each ear.

                                     HEROINE
                         Now!

               BLAM-BLAM! The two shots scatter head everywhere.

               The flames in the bar spread, catching the entire wall and 
               roof on fire.

               EXT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the 
               bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her 
               head out.

               Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for 
               the nearby BEER TRUCK.

               INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               Papa and Momma Beast both charge the bar. The third peanut 
               barrel is released. It sails for them, but they dive out of 
               the way.

               KABLOOM! It takes out the rest of the wall. Fire and smoke 
               fills the place.

               Adulterer douses Momma Beast with booze as Beer Guy nails 
               her with a lit Molotov cocktail.

               WHOOSH! Engulfed in flame, she bolts from the bar shrieking.

                                     BOZO
                         One down, one to go!!!

               Papa enters and is instantly cornered. He swings wildly.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bartender)
                         Help me!

               Heroine and Bartender rip the DEER HEAD from the wall and 
               charge Papa, pinning him against the wall with the antlers.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on!

               Bozo and Beer Guy dive into Papa's legs, holding them down.

               Tuffy picks up The Judge.

               WHAM! The shotgun butt knocks out Papa's front teeth. Tuffy 
               raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that 
               killed her child, but Papa Beast gets an arm free to knock 
               away her fatal blow.

               Bartender wrenches Papa Beast's arm with all his might. With 
               her hair stuck in Papa Beast's claw, Tuffy is pulled face to 
               face with the beast. She squirms as he chomps at her, but 
               with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I can't hold him!!!

                                     HEROINE
                         Do something!!!

               Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's 
               mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking 
               for air.

               Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.

               Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.

               His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.

                                     TUFFY
                         CHOKE ON IT!!!

               With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting 
               away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls 
               out her arm from his throat.

                                     BARTENDER
                         God...

                                     BOZO
                         I need to get your number.

               Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa 
               Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug 
               into the wood.

               Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on, I'll help you.

                                     GRANDPA
                         No thank you, we're content.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm not leaving anyone behind.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Maybe next time, dear.

               Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the 
               breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel, 
               waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer 
               of SMOKE blankets the entire area.

               The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from 
               advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.

                                     HEROINE
                         She's still out here.

               Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stay put.

               She creeps out alone.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you... come on...

               Nothing. Just smoke. And silence.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Come on!

               From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.

               At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, 
               leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering 
               the back.

               INSIDE TRUCK

               Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She 
               advances, hissing.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come and get me you blood-chugging 
                         CUNT!

               Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg 
               door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, 
               Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.

               OUTSIDE TRUCK

               Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You got her? You got her!

                                     HEROINE
                         Not for long, we gotta burn it.

               Heroine looks to the others at the breach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Let's blow this thing!

               The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt 
               and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with 
               Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails 
               to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.

                                     BEER GUY
                         When this lights, run like hell.

               About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his 
               silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                              (catching lighter)
                         Here we go...

               Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!

               A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.

               It's Momma Beast. Again and again.

                                     TUFFY
                         What is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's calling for help.

               Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the 
               truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the 
               fire with his foot.

                                     BOZO
                         The fan has officially been buried 
                         in the shit.

               Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of 
               the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. 
               The group gasps. Trampy backs away.

                                     TRAMPY
                         We have to run --

               BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, 
               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box 
               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. 
               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma 
               Beast emerges.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get to your cars!!!

               The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.

               Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast 
               RIPS Para from Bozo's back.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker! Give him back!

               Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still 
               alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh Jesus!

                                     PARA
                         HELLLPPP!

               Bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again, runs.

                                     BOZO
                         I thought we lost you --

               Para is RIPPED into the air again.

                                     BOZO
                         You FUCKER!

               Tuffy and Bartender jump into his PICKUP TRUCK.

                                     TUFFY
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get in!

               Heroine hops in the back.

               Beer Guy and Adulterer run to a car together. Beer Guy lags 
               behind, continually looking over his shoulder.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Run and quit looking back!

               As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit 
               him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his 
               Trans-Am.

                                     BOZO
                         DO IT!

               VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape.

               The "MIAMI VICE" theme song blares from the speakers.

                                     BOZO
                         Get me FUCK BIRDS!

               Bozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path.

                                     BOZO
                         No you don't!

               BAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's 
               disemboweled body sailing through the air.

                                     BOZO
                         VENGEANCE!

               Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are 
               moving everywhere.

                                     PARA
                         Oh Jesussss...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The burning JUKEBOX plays a slow love song. Dancing and 
               holding each other, Grandpa smooches Grandma on the forehead.

                                     GRANDPA
                         We had a good run.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Para crawls along the ground, being ignored by the Beasts.

                                     PARA
                         HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY!

               Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood 
               and guts. He spots Para.

                                     BOZO
                         Hang on!

               Para claws the ground.

                                     PARA
                         Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

               Bartender jerks the wheel of his car.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh shit!

               Para sees Bartender's approaching truck.

                                     PARA
                         NOOO!!!

               Para rolls right, just missing tires. Para yells for his 
               brother.

                                     PARA
                         COME ON! GODDAMN IT!

               Bozo's eyes bulge.

                                     BOZO
                         Brother!!!

               BAM! Para is SMEARED by Adulterer's car.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Shit!

               Bozo floors it.

                                     BOZO
                              (overly endearing)
                         I meant to tell you so much!

               The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters, 
               moving to their table. It moves in for the kill.

               Grandpa kisses his wife gently.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Close your eyes, hon.

               The Beast OPENS its massive jaws and... CRASH! Bozo's car 
               DRIVES through the bar, SMEARING the Beast.

               INT. BOZO'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

                                     BOZO
                         YOU ARE SUCKING MY DICK!!!

               Bozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker!!!

               Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.

               He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE 
               from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

               Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and 
               looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.

                                     BOZO
                         Lord, if I die, bury me upside down 
                         so the world can KISS MY ASS!

               Cousin Beast leaps in.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The remaining TWO CARS race down the road.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               With the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I think we're in the clear --

               BAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and 
               yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers.

               Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma 
               yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out 
               Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel.

               IN THE BACK

               Momma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast 
               nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one 
               claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on 
               tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck.

               Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything.

               Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags 
               Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's 
               face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second.

               Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine.

               Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams!

               And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket 
               and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, 
               taking the locket with her.

               Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for 
               what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy 
               jumps out.

                                     TUFFY
                         Are you okay?!

                                     HEROINE
                         I don't know, I think --

                                     ADULTERER (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               They both jump as Adulterer approaches.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Are you two all right? They left! We 
                         made it! I think we made it!

                                     TUFFY
                         They'll be back.

                                     HEROINE
                         We're safe until dark, but we need 
                         to find other people.

               Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a 
               pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.

                                     HEROINE
                         You know where the IGA grocery store 
                         is over in Red Mountain?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Um, yeah, ten miles west.

                                     HEROINE
                         They have a bomb shelter.

               PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Heroine lights up and 
               passes one to Tuffy.

                                     HEROINE
                         We'll meet in three hours?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't wanna go home alone... I 
                         don't wanna see what might have...

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry about that. Just go.

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the 
               desolate road.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry about your son. I really 
                         am.

               Tuffy nods, affectionately touching his hand.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Where are you two going?

                                     HEROINE
                         We're going to get my little girl.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I wish you luck.

               The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the 
               road. He glances up at the RISING SUN.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               A sign reading "RED MOUNTAIN" swings lazily in the breeze.

               Tuffy and Heroine coast down a town road. There are random 
               POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the dirt. No one in sight.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of 
               life here either.

               EXT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               The car pulls up to the house. The only sound is the wind.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy look at each other and proceed with caution.

               INT. ADULTERER'S CAR -- DAY

               He pulls up in front of his house. The front door is swinging 
               open, BANGING against the door frame.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Heroine enters the ransacked house. Tuffy follows.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He enters his house. It too, is a mess.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They look down the stairs to the basement. Nothing. They 
               move up the stairs to the second floor.

               SECOND FLOOR

               SMACK! They spin to the noise.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He moves up the stairs to the master bedroom. SMACK!

               There's a noise at the end of the hall. SMACK!

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They cautiously move to the last room in the hall. A 
               scratched, closed door without an outside handle.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no...

               Heroine kicks in the door and...

               There's a note on a teddy beer that says, "WE WENT TO THE 
               SHELTER. LOVE GRANDMA AND CHARLIE."

                                     TUFFY
                         They're alive!

               The shudders SMACK against the wall.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.

               He sighs and puts it down.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY

               The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff 
               wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches 
               up the street.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings.  

                                     HEROINE
                         It's right up there, in the back of 
                         the store.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They 
               get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer 
               kneels against his car.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where is everyone?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't know, I just got here. Did 
                         you find your girl?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's supposed to already be here.

                                     TUFFY
                         Your family?

               Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'm sorry.

               Adulterer sheepishly nods.

                                     HEROINE
                         This place is a ghost town.

               The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond 
               the glass doors.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (pointing)
                         Look!

               In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE 
               stands staring at them.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie?

               Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets 
               awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie!

               As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Stop! There's something wrong!

                                     HEROINE
                         Honey!?

               The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her 
               ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, 
               the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh god.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast 
               HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to 
               right, panic stricken.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mommy!

               The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something 
               is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but 
               Adulterer holds her at bay.

                                     ADULTERER
                         It's a trap!

               At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the 
               distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

               Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for 
               Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole 
               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting 
               Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (gurgling blood)
                         Run!!!

               Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store 
               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him 
               towards her main prey. 

               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the 
               survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close. 

                                     HEROINE
                              (a whisper)
                         I love you...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- AN HOUR LATER

               A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking 
               lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps 
               from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.

               A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed 
               alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into 
               action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         What's the damage radius?

               The Man in Tan closes his eyes in thought.

                                     COMPANY MAN (O.S.)
                         Sir, we have movement!

               The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of 
               blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN 
               follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.

               INT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.

               The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting 
               the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the 
               trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.

               It's scratched, bashed and thrashed.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Open it.

               Company Man #2 steps forward and uses a metal-cutting chainsaw 
               to cut through the hinges. The door falls with a THUD.

               As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at 
               the men, huddled together in a defensive stance.

               The Man in Tan creaks his neck.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Gentlemen, help them to safety.

               Heroine, holding Charlie, lurches back.

                                     HEROINE
                         You're not safe, she's still alive, 
                         she'll be back...

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Relax. We know. We're the calvary.

               The Man in Tan steps forward, guiding the group out.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- MOMENTS LATER

               A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody 
               rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         What happened to you?

               The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.

               Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.

                                     BOZO
                         Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn 
                         hero for Christ's sake!

               A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in 
               the back. He settles at the sight of the others.

                                     GRANDMA
                         G'morning.

                                     BOZO
                         Thanks for waitin' for me back there, 
                         really fuckin' appreciate it!

               Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped 
               into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.

                                     TUFFY
                         How'd you survive?

                                     BOZO
                         I found a new weak spot on 'em, but 
                         it damn ain't pretty getting to it.

               Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you taking us?

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         A trauma center. We have doctors 
                         waiting.
                              (off Heroine's pause)
                         You're in good hands now.

               The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan 
               locks eyes with the Driver.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Do it quick and spread the mess.

               The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.

               The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck 
               drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: THE MAN IN TAN 
               AGE: 45 
               OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU 
               PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD

               The Man in Tan exhales a gust of smoke.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
FINAL DESTINATION

 


"FINAL DESTINATION"   

Originally Called "FLIGHT 180"

By James Wong and Glen Morgan



January 15, 1999



Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place.
Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable
inevitability......it will arrive.

The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die."

As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING!
A CRACK OF THUNDER!

                                                CUT TO:

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED

An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40."

"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:

AN OLD TABLE FAN

swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...

THE BED

A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.

THE TABLE FAN

turns, head swiveling away from the bed.

TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror.
As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.

CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.

TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN

There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.

                        BARBARA
            Alex...

CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."

One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;
"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"
Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.

                        BARABRA (Cont'd)
            Tod and George's dad just called,
            he's picking you up at 10 in the 
		morning. Bus leaves the high school 
		for JFK at noon.

Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.


                        KEN
            My suitcase workin' out for ya?

Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.

                       ALEX
            Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave
            that on. It's like... the tag
            made the last flight without
            crashin' or anything, right?
            So, it should stay on, or with,
            the bag for good luck.

                        BARBARA
            Where would you get a nutball
            idea like that?


EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER

is torn away from the suitcase handle.

RETURN

As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.

                        KEN
            I'm still here.

Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad.

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Seventeen and on the loose. Ten 
		days in Paris. In the springtime! 
		Live it up, Alex...

CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son...

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Got your whole life ahead of you.

ALEX

CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - LATER

The storm has ceased. The room is QUIET.

As if itself a presence, CAMERA CREEPS across the dark and motionless room TOWARD Alex, sleeping soundly. CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the level of the bed until Alex is in the f.g. and the room is visible behind him.

On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.

Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...

THE WINDOWS

which... are closed.

ALEX

puzzled, checks...

THE TABLE FAN

which is off.

ALEX

perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however... the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read... 1:80.

CAMERA ADJUSTS FROM the "Arrival-Departure Schedule" to REVEAL forty high school KIDS, four TEACHERS and several PARENTS are gathered inside the International terminal at J.F.K. Several of the students wear Fighting Colonial leterman's jackets or hats and shirts displaying "Mt. Abraham High, New York."

            You are not required to give money

Alex gathers his bags, as does his best friend TOD WAGGNER and his older brother GEORGE WAGGNER, standing before their father, JERRY WAGGNER. For Alex, any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip.

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Alright, you guys got everything?

                        TOD
            Yeah, we're all set Dad.

MR. MURNAU, the French teacher (any further description necessary?) and leader of the class trip waves his arm.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Les estudients, allons en France!

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Does that mean "go?"

Tod shrugs, "I guess" as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye. Mr. Waggner then gives his older son a hug.

                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.

             I'll miss you guys.

Tod and George gives a wave, as does Alex, who is slapped on the back by Mr. Waggner.

                        MR. WAGGNER
             Take care of those two, Alex.

                        ALEX
             I will. Don't worry.

The group begins down the airport toward the check-in counter. In the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, CLEAR RIVERS, 17, reading the TROPIC OF CANCER. The loner in the group, Clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. She appears aloof and more wordly then the other students.

Readying his ticket and documents, Tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.

                        TOD
           I didn't think anything could
           worse than my yearbook picture.

                        GEORGE

Mr. Murnau stops the group. Excited, he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Entendez classe, qu'est ce que
            c'est l'announce?

Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen.

CARTER HORTON

is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband...

                        CARTER
                 (re: MURNAU)
            What the fuck's he want?

Terry, hot now, but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years, smiles obsequiously and mouths "shh."

                        P.A. SYSTEM (O.S., CONT'D)
            cher aeroport n'est responsable
            pour leurs activities.

Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as...

                        CLEAR
            The airport doesn't endorse 
		solicitors.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!

She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the 
procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs...

                        ALEX
            Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with 
		that shit the whole time?

A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose.

                        HARE KRISHANA
            Death is not the end.

CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY.

As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies.

                        MS. LEWTON
            It will be for you if you harass
            my students.

She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group.

Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile...

                 (mouths)
            Fuck off.

As she turns her back and continues down the terminal...

INT. CHECK IN DESK - AIRPORT - DAY

Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport...

                        TICKET CLERK
            I have a few questions to ask you 
		this afternoon.

O.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK.

                        TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
            Did you pack these bags yourself?

The CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward.

ALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

Plastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... "CANCELLED."

ALEX

CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia...

                        TICKET CLERK (CONT'D, O.S.)
            Have your belongings remained in your
            possession the entire time?

Alex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to...

ALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

The plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... "DEPARTED."

TICKET DESK

Alex is still considering the "messages..."

                         TICKET CLERK
            Have you recieved any packages
            from persons unknown to you?

Alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward...

CLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE

a new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag.

RETURN

Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.

                        TICKET CLERK
            Same as your birthday.

Alex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, "pardon me?" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket...

                         TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
            April 25th. Four-twenty-five...
            your birthday is the same as your

CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward...

ALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

INT.  SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR

The ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches.

Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust.

                        BILLY
            I can't believe they let that 
		dickhead on this trip.

                        GEORGE
            His parents bought a ton of those 
		trip certificates we had to sell, 
		just to get him out of their hair

Excited, Tod speaks in a convert tone over Alex's shoulder.

                        TOD
            Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk
            so you're sittin' next to Christa 
		and I'm next to Blake.

Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors...

ALEX'S POV - TWO GIRLS

Attractive and they know it, CHRISTA MARSH and BLAKE DREYER appear clearly out of Alex and Tod's league.

                        TOD (CONT'D)
            That's seven hours and most of it is 
		in the dark.

ALEX AND TOD

The boys dump their change in a plastic bowl.

                        TOD
            Dude, if we don't get someone
            going on this flight, we should
            just call Dr. Kervorkian and put
            ourselves out of our fuckn' misery.

As Alex and Tod pass through the metal detector, their eyes performing reconnaissance on Christa and Blake, the opening drum BLASTS of Boingo's "No One Lives Forever" OVERLAPS...

CAMERA ADJUSTS from the sign indicating GATE 39. The class is squirrely and  excited. Mr. Murnau, Ms. Lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight.

CAMERA MOVES ALONG the awaiting passengers... Carter and Terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting...

Blake and Christa are flipping through Parisian fashion magizines... Billy Hitchcock lays into a Burrito Supreme...

CAMERA MOVES to an empty seat. Clear Rivers ENTERS FRAME and sits, 
struggling with her Walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "Boingo" (a cheat that We hear the song)

As she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a Paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down. A passing, unidentified, student reaches down and hands her the book, still open and face down.

                        CLEAR
            Thanks.

The student continues down toward the observation deck. Clear looks at the opened guidebook.

CLEAR'S POV - GUIDEBOOK

Princess Di's Mercedes is totaled in a Paris tunnel. Besides the photo are two portraits of Diana and Dodi Al Fayed.

CLEAR

CAMERA INCHES IN as she shakes off a shiver down her spine. She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully REVEALED to be Alex Browning.

He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane.

ALEX'S POV - 747

It is raining. In the distance, MUFFLED THUNDER RUMBLES.

CAMERA CREEPS AWAY from the plane... huge, seemingly incapable of flight and yet we unquestioningly trust our lives in this machine. Emotionless. Cold. Lifeless, and yet soon full of life.

ALEX

CAMERA inches in on him.

                        TOD (O.S.)
            Dude, let's take a dump.

Tod MOVES INTO FRAME beside Alex...

           	Man, that is one George Michael
           	notch from being gay.

           	Dude, get wisdom. We're about to

            a wicked cable and then right after

             Vingt huit, vingt neuf...

PASSENGER RAMP

Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane.

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE

ALEX

sneaks a quick check with Tod.

ALEX'S POV - TOD

shakes his head. "NO! NO! DON'T DO IT."

ALEX AND THE GIRLS

He looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched. Alex shrugs, "Sure." In front of him Tod throws up his arms, disgusted. Alex climbs out of his seats. The girls are touchy-feely thankful, but only know guys dig that.

                        CHRISTA AND BLAKE
            You're so sweet. Thanks, Alex.

Alex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22 H.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing...

The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then...

The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.

ALEX'S POV - THE CABIN

Passengers SCREAM! Unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft INTO CAMERA, which BUFFETS and SHAKES...

OXYGEN MASKS

deploy from the overhead compartments. A prerecorded message, like that recorded by the black box of the crash of JAL# 123 August 12, 1985, BLARES over the P.A., with erie calm...

                        MESSAGE (V.O.)
            Fasten seat belts...put on oxygen 
		masks...

ALEX

his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window.

ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW

The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin.

ALEX

breaths deep into his oxygen cup.

The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS.

Then...

KA-BOOM

A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.

Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.

Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.

Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.

ALEX AND TOD

SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.

OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down.

ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME...

                                              CUT TO:

CLOSE - ALEX'S TERRIFIED EYES

dilating rapidly, as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche.

                        CHRISTA (O.S.)
            Alex?

ALEX

Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.

                        CHRISTA
            Could you trade seats with Blake so
		she and I can sit together? I asked 
		Tod, but he's got some medical thing.

Alex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned.

                        TOD
            Dude, what up?

Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row.

ALEX

grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
            Is there a a problem, sir?

Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode.

Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions.

                        CARTER
            What's your fuckin' problem?

Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Alex? Qu'est-ce se?

                        ALEX
            Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA
            EXPLODE!

Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense.

THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

immediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin.

CARTER AND TERRY

               CARTER                TERRY
        Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny.

ALEX

frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle.

                        ALEX
            We have to get out!

This frightens everyone. Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            We have to get off this plane!

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            Now! NOW!!

RETURN

Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend. Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force.

                  	CARTER
	      Sit! DOWN! Browning!

               TOD                             FLIGHT ATTENDANT
    Alex. Alex! Easy, man. Take it        Sir, if this is a joke,
    easy.                                 we don't tolerate such 
							humor.

The flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm.

                             ALEX
                I'm not joking! I'm not joking!

Ms. Lewton and Mr. Murnau move to the seats. Flight attendants try 
restraining Alex from reaching the aisle.

           MS. LEWTON               	       MR. MURNAU
  Alex, Knock it off. It's alright.       Settle down, Alex.

                        ALEX
		Listen to me! This plane will 
		explode on take-off!

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
            Sir, we will remove you from the
            aircraft if this continues.

                        CARTER
            I'll remove him.

                         ALEX
            Fuck you! I'll remove myself!

Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.

The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.

A male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well.

                        TERRY
            He didn't do nothin'!

She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend.

Just arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a 
STEWARDESS to get to his seat. He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                  (he's had it)
            Anybody in the aisle is off the 
		plane!

                        BILLY
            No, wait, I was late... that's my 
		seat right there!

Under protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane. Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles.

          MS. LEWTON                       MR. MURNAU
   Everybody just stay where you    Mr. Carpenter, keep an eye on
   are. Just sit tight.             things for a moment.

Tod watches, amazed and concerned for his friend. He looks across the cabin to...

TOD'S POV - GEORGE

his brother gestures, mouths... "you should go with him."

TOD

starts off down the aisles. CAMERA COUNTERS... ADJUSTING TO CLEAR RIVERS. Amongst the chaos, she considers for a beat, then grabs her backpack, stands and moves into the aisle to exit the plane.

                                               CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING AREA/TUNNEL - GATE 39 - DAY

Alex, the co-pilot, Carter, the attendant, Mr. Murnau, Ms, Lewton, Terry, Tod and Billy proceed down the tunnel. Billy is confused by the chaos.

                        BILLY
            I didn't do anything! I have my 
		ticket right here!

Arriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers.

                        CO-PILOT
            You got this?

The officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter.

The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive.

                        CO-PILOT
            No one gets back on board. That's my 
		call.

                        MS. LEWTON
            PLEASE... I've got forty students 
		going to Paris...

During these negotiations... CAMERA MOVES PAST Ms. Lewton and the Co-Pilot to the boarding ramp door...

Clear Rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others, aware she is unnoticed in the confusion. CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up toward...

ALEX

CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.

                        TOD
            It's alright. It's alright. You're 
		off the plane. You're off the 
		plane...

Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau.

                        MS. LEWTON
             Airline's not taking this very well.
             They'll let one of us back on and
             the rest can grab a six-ten flight.
             Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle.
             It's alright. It's not that big of a
             deal.

                        MR. MURNAU
            I'll stay.

	                  MS. LEWTON
            No, you know the whole French thing. 
		Get on the plane.

Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau.

                        BILLY
            I was in the bathroom. The lock was 
		stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!

Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD.

EXT. GATE 39 - AFTERNOON - CARTER, TERRY & BILLY'S POV

Flight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway.

INT. GATE 39 - OBSERVATION WINDOW - AFTERNOON

Carter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton.

MENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39

Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead.

                        TOD
            I called your mom and dad and 
		they're on their way.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Alex, talk to me. What happened?

Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him...

                        ALEX
            I... I saw it... like, I don't
            know... the plane took off. I saw
            it leave the runway... I looked down
            and saw the ground...

Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            And then the cabin banged and the
            left side exploded. The the whole
            plane... blew up. It was so real.
            Exactly how everything goes.

                         TOD
            Been on many planes that blew up, 
		have you?

Good point. Alex looks away.

                         MS. LEWTON
            You must have fallen asleep.

                         CARTER
            We get thrown off the plane and blow 
		a half day in Paris because Browning 
		has a bad dream?
                 (mocking Alex)
            It's going to explode! It's going to 
		explode!

                        TOD
            Fuck off, Horton.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Tod...

A raw nerve, Alex stands.

                        ALEX
            Only trip you're gonna take is to 
		the fuckin' hospital.

Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex.

Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal.

OBSERVATION DECK

CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off...

                        BILLY
            There they go and here we stay.

AIRPORT TERMINAL

One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway.

                        CARTER
             You're payin' for my trip, Browning!

                        ALEX
             I wish you were on the plane!

In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame.

It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window...

ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180

The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky.

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him.

GATE 39

Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out.

O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy.

CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him.

CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

SILENCE

A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance.

The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.

ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM

Ms. Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex. Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder.

ALEX

frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength...

                        ALEX
            You're lookin' at me as if I caused 
		it. I did not cause this.

LEWTON, CARTER, TERRY, AND BILLY

maintain their uncertain expressions. With strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Is everyone dead? Are there any
            survivors?

WIDER

Alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.

                        ALEX
            How would I know? You think I'm
            some sort of...

                        CLEAR
            He's not a witch.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Alex, relieved and thankful, as he turns to her...

CLEAR RIVERS - ALEX'S POV

CAMERA MATCHES the move INTO HER as she looks up at Alex, not with fear or repulsion... but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection.

WIDER

Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten.

A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team."

The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.

                        SEIGEL
            Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National
            Transportation Safety Board vice
            chairmen. We've notified your families
            and they are on their way. Does anyone
            feel they need medical attention or
            spiritual counseling at this time?

Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. Ms. Lewton reacts, snapping...

                        MS. LEWTON
            Have they found any survivors?
            What's going on?

Seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.

                        SEIGEL
            The cause of the explosion is 
		undetermined. Nassau county
		authorities are on the scene. Naval
	      search and rescue are en route.

He gestures... "and that's all we know." The group slips deeper into despair.

                        WEINE
            We understand how you must be
            feeling at this hour... and although
            we know it may be difficult, we must
            ask you some questions... regarding
            today's events, while it's still
            fresh in your minds.

The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate.

                        WEINE
            It may be valuable to our rescue
            attempts, or any potential...
            criminal investigation.

The agents, F.B.I. badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward Alex.

ALEX

reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him...

                                                 CUT TO:

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - CLOSE - SCHRECK & WEINE

are direct and professional, with no hidden agenda in searching for the truth. Seigel and Hawks from the NTSB are behind them taking notes...

                        SCHRECK
            You said...
                  (checks notes)
            "Listen to me! This plane will
            explode on take-off."
                  (to Alex)
            How did you know that?

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous... not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.

                        ALEX
            I got this... feeling... a weird
            feeling... I can't explain it...

                        WEINE
            Did you take any seditives before
            boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping
            pills?

                        ALEX
            No. I saw it. I saw it!

Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience. Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk.

                        ALEX
            Not like a dream... more than that.
		I experienced the plane exploding... 
		it was so horrible... I know what 
		they all went through tonight...

The officers remain quiet, gauging his explanation.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            I'm not a pyschic... I've never had
            this happen before...

The officers study him, unsure yet carefully...

                        SCHRECK
            Did this "weird feeling" have
            anything to do with you saying
            you wished Carter Horton was on the
            plane... just before it exploded?

Alex looks up, stunned. He didn't even recall this until now.

                        ALEX
            No!

                        SCHRECK
            Why'd you say it?

He considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes...

                        ALEX
            Because... I... never thought it 
		would really happen.

Weine leans foward...

                        WEINE
            If that's the case, Alex... why did 
		you really get off the plane?

CAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - TOD

CAMERA CONTINUES THE MOVE on Tod... as if just realizing...

                        TOD
            My brother... told me to keep an eye 
		on Alex. He stayed... and I went to 
		make sure Alex was okay.
                  (a whisper)
            He told me to get off the plane.
	
INT. A SECOND ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON

displaying a similar sickened expression as Tod...

                        MS. LEWTON
            Larry Murnau told me to get back

                  (pause, guiltily)
            I sent him back on the plane.

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - WEINE

                        WEINE
            No one forced you to get off the
            plane. You told us you aren't friends
            with any that did... so, why did you
            leave the airplane?

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve...

                        CLEAR
            Because I saw and I heard Alex.
            And... I believed him.

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL BUILDING - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

The surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale.

Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child.

Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others.

ALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY

Their parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image.

ALEX

his eyes moves toward...

CLEAR RIVERS

alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home.

ALEX

his eyes find...

TOD AND HIS FATHER

JERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER!

INT. KEN BROWNING'S CAR - NIGHT

Alex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages.

Alex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up.

                        CLEAR
            Here's good.

The car pulls over.

                        CLEAR
            Thank you for the ride.
				
She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room.

ALEX

stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - PENNANT

Mt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials.

ALEX

and now, the tears arrive. He begins crying, SOBBING, as his mother and father hold him. O.S., OUTSIDE... lighting FLASHES... THUNDER RUMBLES...

INT. LIVING ROOM - BROWNING HOUSE - NIGHT - TV

CNN broadcasts video footage of the disaster. Seat cushions and personal belongings float in the harsh floodlights.

LIVING ROOM

It is late and dark. Only the pale light of the TV spills across the living room. Ken and Barbara have fellen asleep, but their son remains awake.

Alex's red eyes are locked on the screen, mortified. O.S., a VICIOUS CRACK of LIGHTNING and immediate THUNDER... as if calling Alex to the window. He remains fixed on the TV.

ALEX'S POV - TV

An image of Hell as jet fuel burns on the ocean. O.S., as if furious at the slight, THUNDER BANGS...

ALEX

He turns, stands... and moves to the picture window, pulling the curtains aside as CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM...

ALEX'S POV - THE STORM

It is as if Nature is angry. Lightning BOLTS spiderweb across the sky. THUNDER BOOMS.

A shard of lightning breaks across the front yard. Oddly, it does not make contact. In the split-second strobe of lightning flash, the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at Alex.

ALEX

horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen. Just felt on the ROAR OF THUNDER...

                                             CUT TO BLACK:

Over black:

                        MINISTER (V.O.)
            Thirty-nine days have passed since
            we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones,
            friends, and teachers.

FADE IN:

EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - CLOSE - ALEX

wearing a dark suit and tie, sits beside his parents on white folded chairs. His head is bowed, guilty and sad...

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            As each day passes without a
            determining cause for the accident,
            we ask ourselves, "Why?"

Alex raises his eyes and looks across the ceremony...

ALEX'S POV - TOD

sits with his mother, LINDA WAGGNER and his father, Jerry. Destraught, Jerry stares off blankly at the minister.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more 
		knows his time than fish taken in 
		the fatal net...

ALEX

guiltily averts his eyes. Ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...or birds trapped in the snare...

Alex checks over his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - OVER HIS SHOULDER - LAST ROW OF SEATS

Special agents Schreck and Weine subtly survey the area, taking notes. Although their eyes are beyond sunglasses, the tilt of their head indicates they are watching Alex.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...like these the children of men...

ALEX

turns away, tense. He looks at the minister.

                         MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...caught when the Time falls
            suddenly upon them."

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, feeling eyes upon them. He looks up...

ALEX'S POV - CLEAR RIVERS

is actually sexy and a bit scandalous in her black dress. Still, she is off by herself, eyes burning at Alex as if challenging him to challenge the words being spoken.

ALEX

self-consciously turns away, unable to face her, let alone the words being spoken.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D O.S.)
            And so before we can heal, before we 
		can escape the presence of Death
		Time, we must mourn and celebrate
            theirs with this memorial.

WIDER

A student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone. Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run."

Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed. The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial.

MEMORIAL LINE

Carter and Terry appear IN FRAME. Terry holds a rose. As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them. Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him.

                        CARTER
            Hope you don't think, Browning, that 
		because my name ain't on this wall... 
		that I owe you anything.

                        ALEX
            I don't.

                        CARTER
                  (re: victims)
            All I owe is these people.
                  (turns to Alex)
            To live my life to the fullest.

Alex winces from Carter's breath...

                        ALEX
            Then maybe you should lay off the 
		J.D.

Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold.

                        CARTER
            Don't ever fucking again tell me 
		what to do. I control me. Not you.

Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release.

                        CARTER
            I'm never gonna die.

He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off.

Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line.

                        BILLY
            I took my driver's test this week at
		the DMV...

Alex turns to him, increudlously..

                        BILLY
            Got a 70. Lowest score, but I 
		passed. When I was done with the 
		test, the guy who drives with you
		during the test, he goes, "Young 
		man, you're going to die at a 
		very young age."
                 (beat)
            That true?
		
                        ALEX
            Not here, not now.
                 (beat)
            Not EVER!

Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER...

                        BILLY
            If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will 
		she say "no?"

Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial.

Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names...

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell.

RETURN

Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain....

                        ALEX
            Ms. Lewton...

Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Don't talk to me. You scare the hell
            out of me.

Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial.

                        TOD
                 (a greeting)
            Hey.

Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line...

                        ALEX
            I don't want to sound gay, or
            nothin, but... I miss you.

Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial.

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER.

RETURN

As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.

                        TOD
            Me, too.
                  (beat)
            But my dad doesn't understand. When 
		he's better; you and me, road trip 
		to the City. Catch the Yanks.

                        ALEX
            That's a plan.

Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium.

                        TOD
            I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton
            showed me in her class, they're 
		gonna let me read it. It says what 
		I'm feeling.

Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled.

                        CLEAR
            Because of you... I'm still alive. 
		Thank you.

Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower.

                        TOD (V.O.)
            We say that the hour of death
            cannot be forecast...

Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve. CAMERA PUSHES IN, at an ominous ANGLE and rhythm, to the podium.

                        TOD (CONT'D)
            But when we say this, we imagine 
		that the hour is placed in an 
		obscure and distant future.

As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow.

ALEX

looks up at the sky...

THE SKY - ALEX'S POV

Within the deep blue, a single black cloud blocks the sun.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN as, troubled, he looks back to Tod...

TOD

            This afternoon... which is so

INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

A lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair." Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor. Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents...

Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs.

ALEX

sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and... REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy.

Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.

An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled...

ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO

Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and 
mysterious.

ALEX

closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.

Alight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat.

Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.

As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not 
understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door.

The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.

BACK OF THE TOILET TANK

Tod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe.

As the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle. Drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor.

Odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral.

ALEX

studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however...

A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!

ALEX'S POV - WINDOW

An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature.

Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off.

THE TABLE FAN

torn form the magazine flits across the room.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over...

Tod's hand ENTER FRAME. The scissors, sadistically just out of reach.

TOD'S FACE

FALLS INTO FRAME, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth.

TOD'S POV - DEATH

all four edges of FRAME appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center. Then, from within the center... appears Tod's face. Although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish, until... suddnely, shockingly... Tod's face decays, as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into 72 FRAMES.

TOD

The moment of realization...

HIS FEET

kick upon the slippery basin. After a beat... they stop.

TOD

As his body settles... dies... CAMERA PULLS AWAY fully revealing his lifeless form. Once behind the toilet tank, CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the floor. The water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.

The boy franically moves to a paramedic.

            What happened? Is Tod alright?

SCHRECK AND WEINE

hearing this, they turn to one another, with an expression suggesting a deepening suspicion.

sees the officers. Assuming they are sympathetic to his concern, he starts toward them, until...

                        CLEAR (O.S.)
            Alex!

Alex stops, looks around. Behind the tree and in the shadows of the adjacent house, stands Clear Rivers.

                 (a warning)
            Get outta here!

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house.

ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY

is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard.

ALEX

is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby.

                        ALEX
            What... what happened?

Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly.

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Didn't you... "see" it?

Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction.

                        MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D)
            Couldn't you "predict" it?
            Couldn't you read his mind?
		
Alex remains silent, hurt.

                  He wouldn't do it!

Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof."

                        ALEX
            He... he told me we would be friends
            again after you got better. After 
		you got over George. Why would he 
		make plans for the future if he were 
		planning on killing himself?

                        MR. WAGGNER
            All my wife and I will ever know is 
		we wouldn't have lost our youngest 
		son... if you'd told our oldest to 
		get off the plane.

Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle.

The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers.

ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD

Clear is gone.

FRONT YARD

everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend...

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE - LEAVES ON TREES

A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk.

A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  "...Tod."

                        CLEAR  (O.S.)
            Almost Autumn.

Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.

                        ALEX
            It's only the end of June.

                        CLEAR
                  (shrugs)
            Yeah, but everthing's always in
            transition. If you focus, even now, 
		one week into summer... you can feel 
		Autumn coming.
                  (beat)
            Almost like bein' able... to see the 
		future.

Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.

INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY

Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.

                        CLEAR
            Know what this is?

She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.

                        ALEX
            Like, um... you're mad about
            something?

She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.

                        CLEAR
            A piece of debris... from the plane. 
		I went to the shore off the crash 
		site and it washed up on the beach.

                        ALEX
            You went there? I've wanted to go 
		there, but I thought it was off 
		limits.

                        CLEAR
            It is. But that didn't stop me.
            Shouldn't stop you.

Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...

                        ALEX
            Why were you there last night?

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...

                        CLEAR
            Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
            the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
            suicides. But they were there last 
		night, that means: one, they still 
		don't have a clue what caused the 
		crash. Two, they haven't ruled out 
		anything. And the fact that seven
            people got off the plane is probably 
		weird enough, not to mention, that 
		one of those people had a vision, or 
		whatever, of it exploding minutes 
		before it did explode, is highly
            suspicious. And it doesn't help that 
		the visionaries' friend just 
		committed suicide.

Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.

                        ALEX
            Why were you there last night?

Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.

                         CLEAR
            Know what this is?

Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."

                         CLEAR
            It's you.

Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.

                         CLEAR
            Not a likeness. It's how you make 
		me feel, Alex.

                         ALEX
            I'm... really sorry.

                         CLEAR
            Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
            know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
            to take form. And, yet, creating an
            absolute but incomprehansible 
		attraction.

Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.

                         CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Before that day, you were just 
		another suburban nothing that would 
		never have anything to do with my 
		life. And I'm sure you thought I was 
		some Marilyn Manson body-pierced 
		freak, or whatever.
                       (beat)
            But at that moment... on the plane... 
		I felt what you felt. I didn't know 
		where all those emotions were coming 
		from until you started freaking out.

Alex sighs, embarrassed.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            I didn't see what you saw, but I
		felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that 
		X-Files bullshit... but it was a 
		psychic connection. Why to me? Why 
		to you?

Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.

                        CLEAR
            And you can still feel it, can't 
		you? Something from that day is 
		still with you. I know, because I 
		can still feel you.

Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...

                        CLEAR
            That's why I was there last night.

                        ALEX
            I've never dealt with death before.
            I wasn't alive when my grandparents
            died. I wish I could know. I mean, 
		all this... could just be in our 
		heads. Now it feels like it's 
		everywhere.

                        CLEAR
            "It?"
				
                        ALEX
            What if Tod... is just the first...
            of us?

The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
				
                        CLEAR
            Is that something you're "feeling?"

                        ALEX
            I don't know. I wish I could just see
            him... one more time, then, maybe... 
		I would know.

                        CLEAR
            Then, let's go see him!

Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. FUNERAL HOME - FOYER - NIGHT

CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear...

The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window.

Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet.

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY."

                        CLEAR
                  (whispering)
            Gives me a rush...

                        ALEX
            This place?!

                        CLEAR
            Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.

With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.

A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.

                        CLEAR
            Good call. Very "Quincy."

Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.

From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!

INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.

As Alex and Clear approach...

                        ALEX
            That... him?

                        CLEAR
            I think. But why'd they make him
            up like... Michael Jackson?

                        ALEX
            That's him, but... he's not here. 
		That... whatever... that whatever 
		made him Tod is gone.

Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...

            ALEX                         CLEAR
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!
asshole. You think this        He's not dead? 
is funny, you fucking 
dick? Tod, if you're 
not dead I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

                        MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.)
            Please don't yell...
		
Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You'll wake the dead.

He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth..

                        ALEX
            Why..?

Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            Chemicals in the vascular flush
            create cadaveric spasm.

As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.

                        ALEX
            I'm... a friend of his. His best
            friend. See, his father...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
                  (ominous)
            I know who you are.
The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.

                        CLEAR
            They said he hung himself, but 
		there's no marks.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            I crafted a reconstruction of the 
		Laryngeal prominence region with 
		Velvetone Surgical Wax and 
		Permaseal.

Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck.

                        ALEX
            What are all those tiny marks?

ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK

The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.)
            Cuticle lacerations.
				
WIDER

                        ALEX
            Why would he pull at the wire if he 
		were committing suicide?
				
                         CLEAR
            Why would they say it was a
            suicide... if it weren't?

Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.

                        ALEX
            His father's pretty fucked up with 
		denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with 
		the thought of an other accident... 
		taking another son.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            In Death...

CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            ... there are no accidents. No
            coincidencess. No mishaps.
                  (smiles)
            And no... escapes.

                        ALEX
            You saying Tod did kill himself?

Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What 
		does it matter? He was going to end 
		someday. From the minute you're cut 
		loose from the womb... it's a one 
		way ticket on a trip to the tomb.

Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You may not realize it, but we're
            all just a mouse that a cat has by
            its tail. Every single move we 
		make, from the mundane to the 
		monumental... the red light we stop 
		at, or run; the people we have sex 
		with, or won't with us; the airplane 
		we ride, or walk out of... is all a 
		part of Death's sadistic design
            leading to the grave.

                        ALEX
            Design?

The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            If Life is like a box of 
		chocolates... Death... Death is like 
		a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse
		Trap." The day you're born is just 
		the boot, hanging from the 
		streetlamp, kicking the marble to 
		get things rolling. Growing up is 
		only the marble rolling down the 
		curving chute. You feel immortal 
		having survived school, sex, drugs 
		'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really
            only upset the big hand holding the 
		steel ball that falls into the 
		bathtub. Marriage and kids and 
		career seem to make it all worthwhile 
		until the ball hits the see-saw and 
		flips the diving man into the big 
		barrel. In the old folks home or the
            hospital you just see the big cage 
		rattling down until it captures... 
		the mouse.
                 (beat)
            Game over.

Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...

                        ALEX
            Maybe there's no way to win... 
		but... if you figured out the 
		game... you knew where the "steel 
		ball was rolling" couldn't you 
		avoid the trap and extend the 
		playing time? Couldn't you... cheat 
		Death at Its own game?

Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH, 
INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You already did that by walking off
            the plane. Now you gotta out when 
		and how it'll come back at you.
                  (beat)
            Play your hunch, Alex. If you think
            you can get away from it.
                  (beat)
            But beware the risk of cheating the 
		plan, disrespecting the design... 
		could iniciate a horrifying fury that 
		would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
                  (beat)
            And you don't even want to fuck with 
		that Mack Daddie.

Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex.

                        ALEX
            I'm sorry we broke in.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            No harm. No foul.

Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.

                        CLEAR
            We didn't find what we were looking
            for.

Alex looks at Bludworth...

                        ALEX
            Yeah, we did.

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            I'll see you soon.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.

                        CLEAR (O.S.)
            The mortician was whacked.

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            He was trippin' on formaldehyde.

Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.

                        ALEX
            He said Death has a design. Even
            before he said that I had been
            seeing patterns.

                        CLEAR
                  (sarcastic)
            As in flannels and plaids?

Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.

                        ALEX
            How many died on Flight 180?
            From our group?

                        CLEAR
            Thirty-nine.

                        ALEX
            Remember the gate number?

As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...

                        CLEAR
            No.

                        ALEX
            Thirty-nine.

This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.

                        ALEX
            Remember the departure time?

                        CLEAR
            Like... 4:25.

Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand is lit.

                        ALEX (V.O.)
            Do you know when I was born?

INTERSECTION

Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.

                         CLEAR
            4:25.

                         ALEX
            Right. April 25th.

                         CLEAR
            Wait. I thought you meant the time
            of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as
            in, month and day... that's a reach.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.

INTERSECTION

Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.

                        ALEX
            My birthday is the same as of the 
		time I was meant to die! That's a 
		reach!?

VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.

                        CLEAR
            You're sounding like those people
            who, you know... "Oswald shot 
		Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in 
		a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in 
		a theatre and hid in a warehouse."

CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.

EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.

                        ALEX
            I'm not just layin' down a bunch
            of math here, with this. I'm talking
            about indications... omens... that
            day, that we were meant to die. That,
            if, we have been aware of... would 
		have saved everyone on the plane.

                        CLEAR
            That's total bullshit. You can find
            death omens anywhere you want to.

She picks up her paper coffee cup.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a 
		"C" and ends with an "E." So does 
		the word "choke!" We're going to 
		choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was 
		a whaler. We're going to be 
		harpooned!

Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            You'll go nuts if you start with
            that shit.

Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.

He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.

                        CLEAR
            She's leaving the school. Moving 
		away.

Alex studies, appealing to her...

                        ALEX
            Clear, how do we know that by
            just sitting here, breathing this
            air or sipping the coffee, having
            crossed the street... we haven't 
		started in motion the events that 
		will lead to our death? Fifty years 
		from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
                 (beat)
            You don't unless... you're able to 
		open yourself to the signs I'm 
		willing to show you.

He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.

CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND

slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...

... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.

CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR

She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.

CARTER'S CAR

CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...

                        CLEAR
            I don't understand... did you see 
		Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?

                        ALEX
            No, but it might as well be the
            same thing. This was a message...
            from someone, or something...
            hinting... at the design.

                        CLEAR
            Alex, on the plane... you must have 
		experienced... some kind of hyper 
		awareness. But here... you're
            suggesting Tod's death... and maybe
            our own... will happen because of...
            an active Presence.

Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.

                        ALEX
            The mortician said Death has a 
		design. Now... if you, me, Tod, 
		Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton 
		messed up that design, because, for 
		whatever reason, I was able to see 
		Death's plan... then we cheated it.
                  (beat)
            But what if it was our time, what if 
		we were not meant to get off that 
		plane? What if it is still is our 
		time? If... It... is still not 
		finished with us? We will all still 
		die; now, not later.

Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            Unless... we find the pattern. And 
		cheat it again.

Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex.

                        CLEAR
            After hearing you, just now... I do 
		believe...
				
Alex leans back and sighs, relieved...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            ...that Tod killed himself.

Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.

                        ALEX
            Then there's no one left who can help 
		me.

CARTER'S CAR

His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.

BILLY HITCHCOCK

rides his bike. He reacts, startled by...

BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.

WIDER

Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!

Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...

                        TERRY
            Baby, come on... not now.

But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.

                        TERRY
            Carter...

At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.

                        CARTER
            Kind of have a reunion, here.

                        TERRY
            Let it go!

Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...

                        CARTER
            When are you moving?

                        MS. LEWTON
            A couple of weeks.

She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...

                        CARTER
            We're losing our favorite teacher.

                        ALEX
            Look, there's something you should
            all know.

                        CLEAR
            Alex...

Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.

            CARTER (CONT'D)              ALEX (CONT'D)
Lived here her whole life.        This'll be hard to believe.

Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.

            CARTER (CONT'D)               ALEX (CONT'D)
And now she has to move.          Listen to me, we may all
All because of Browning.          be in danger...

                        TERRY
            Shut up! The both of you!

The two boys stop their heated exchange.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
            They died! We lived!
                   (beat)
            Get over it! I won't let that plane
            crash be the most important thing in 
		my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and 
		if you're gonna waste your life 
		beating the shit out of Alex 
		everytime you see him, then you can 
		just drop fucking dead!

Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND MS. LEWTON

are SPLATTERED with BLOOD before they can even recoil.

                        KEN
            It's that girl... Clear.

No response from Alex. Ken sighs, then into the phone...

            He's in the shower, Clear. Can I 
		have him get back at ya? Sure...

Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son. Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed. Ken sits nearby.

                        KEN (CONT'D)
            She's concerned about you.
                  (beat)
            I'm concerned about you.

Alex turns his eyes to the glass.

                        KEN (CONT'D)
            Why don't you want to talk to her...
            or me?

            out, so much. But there's... some
            things I need to understand before
            I can talk... to anyone about it.

The father respects this young man's wishes. Ken nods "fair enough." In the silent moment, O.S., from the television...

                        CNN ANCHOR (O.S.)
            The National Transportation Safety
            Board has a new theory tonight on the

Alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the VOLUME...

            proceeded to the fuel pump.

TELEVISION

The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.

The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning. It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death.

ALEX

is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes...

Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of 
relocating. The house is old, been in the family forever. Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed.

                        MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)

Startled, Alex turns to find...

Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car.

            Oh... mom's favorite.

She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust.

Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album. CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read...

Ms. Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however... the flames blow out. She pauses, nerves on edge. Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing. She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one.

            No... I can't. As long as I'm in 
		here, it's outta my control.

The agents are taken aback by his answer; unnerved by his sincerity. Weine sighs and looks to his partner, who sighs, frustrated and turns away.

                        WEINE
            Alright, go on. Get outta here.

Alex stands and, with no urgency, moves off. He exits the room.

                        SCHRECK
            Kid gives me the creeps.

                        WEINE
            We got nothing to hold him.

                        SCHRECK
            I don't mean that...
                  (beat)
            There's a couple of times, there...
            I almost believed him.

Weine considers, yet remains skeptical.

                        WEINE
            Sometimes, you give me the creeps.

COFFEE MUG - OVERHEAD

two tea bags are dropped inside, then the steaming hot water.

MS. LEWTON

picks up the cup, raising it toward her lips. She pauses, her expression turning tragic.

On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain. She sits the mug down...

A COFFEE MUG

ENTERS FRAME... displaying the logo of the Mt. Abraham Fighting Colonials.

MS. LEWTON

Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself.

                        MS. LEWTON
            You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's

            You're outta here. Pretty soon...
            you'll be gone.

Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug...

COFFEE MUG

the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as... it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base.

Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.

CAMERA CRANES DOWN to REVEAL the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket. The vodka drip... drip... drips PAST FRAME. Then, Lewton's hand ENTERS and pulls the monitor plug, creating tiny SPARKS at the connection...

the alcohol ignites...

MS. LEWTON

her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor.

the interior catches fire, causing an electrical POP!

MS. LEWTON

turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames.

THE COMPUTER MONITOR

On the screen, the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor... EXPLODES!

MS. LEWTON

a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock.

She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood.

She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes. The needle skips, BUMPS... and settles... umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High."

the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners.

MS. LEWTON

behind her, the stove ERUPTS in FLAMES. They jump, leap like a tiger, landing on her shoulders and hair, which catch on fire...

Alex approaches the front of the house. From here, nothing appears to be wrong. As he catches his breath, sweating, visually examining the house.

From INSIDE, a hoarse, macabre SCREAM! CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX, stunned, before he races off toward the house.

INT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON

DROPS INTO FRAME ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR, hair and sweatshirt aflame. She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames.

On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned. Her open neck wound continues to bleed. Blood pools on the floor. In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up...

LEWTON'S POV - (LOOKING UP) - THE HAND TOWEL

the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.

            Ms. Lewton!

KITCHEN DOORWAY

Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.

MS. LEWTON

a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.

            They say that he got crazy once and

Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...

THE STOVE

a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.

THE COUNTER TOP

the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter...

MS. LEWTON

the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.

LEWTON'S POV - THE SHADOW

descends, the FRAME COLLAPSING until her face, eerily peaceful, but lifeless gray, horrifically decays... flesh rotting, worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains.

MS. LEWTON

as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her.

ALEX

Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.

                        ALEX
            Ms. Lewton!

Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.

Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.

Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.

            Hey, Alex...

Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house.

THE HOUSE

from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.

ALEX

even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.

Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.

                        WEINE
            Why?

She studies the men before averting her eyes.

                        CLEAR
            Because I didn't believe him.

The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...

                        SCHRECK
            If he should contact you, it
            would be in the best interest
            of your own safety to contact us.

Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks at the business card.

Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument.

Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone.

Clear Rivers appears from the shadows.

                        CLEAR
            What are you doing?

                        CARTER
            Terry's name should be on this wall.

Clear is touched by the action.

            So, why'd you want us to meet you
            here? Now?

Carter checks the rearview mirror. Clear looks out the front passenger window. She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us." Billy leans forward from the backseat...

            Um... okay... drive the speed limit,

He sits back, OUT OF FRAME, but quickly darts forward.

            'Cause if you say another word,

Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya. Got it." Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away.

CAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic.

The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.

Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.

ALEX'S POV - THE SKY

The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.

                        ALEX (O.S.)
            Are they up there?

WIDER

Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.

            Somehow... is 180 still in flight?
            Somewhere... are they still safe?

Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.
                        CLEAR
            When I was a kid, like, six or 
		seven... I used to worry so much 
		about my parents dying. Like lying 
		awake at night... just worrying. I 
		loved them so much. I didn't want

		like?
                  (beat)
            Every night... it seemed.

She looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either...

                        ALEX
            Most kids do, I guess.

                        CLEAR
            Most kids never have it happen.

Alex hangs his head...

                        CLEAR
            When I was ten... my dad went into a
            7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard
            somebody say "Don't turn around." So 
		on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was 
		jokin'... he did. And the guy blew 
		his head off.

She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            And, let me tell ya, I had every 
		reason to worry before... because 
		life became shit. I don't blame her, 
		I guess, but my mom couldn't deal 
		with it at all. She married this 
		asshole, who my mom with my real 
		dad would cross the street to avoid 
		this guy. He really didn't want a 
		kid. And so my mom didn't either 
		anymore, I guess.
                  (beat)
            If that was the design for my 
		father... and my family... then fuck 
		Death, FUCK IT!

The waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            And so, anyway... I've thought of 
		that "somewhere," Alex. It exists, 
		that place.

He looks at her.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Where my dad is still safe. Where he 
		had a full pack of cigerettes and 
		kept driving. A place where me and 
		my dad and my mom... are still 
		together....and have no idea about
            this second life, here.
                  (beat)
            A place where our friends are still
		in the sky... where everyone gets a 
		second chance.

She looks at him...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            But that place might only exist in 
		my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I 
		haven't experienced too many second 
		chances in my life. I haven't seen 
		any. But because of all of this, I 
		believe... because of you... I will 
		get a second chance. Because of me, 
		you will. With you in my life... that 
		place, right now existing in our 
		hearts, will spring out... and become 
		a real part of this life.

Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.

                        CLEAR
            And that is the only way we can beat 
		Death... by making something special 
		out of Life.

His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...

They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.

                        ALEX
            This won't be safe.

Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.

                        CLEAR
      	Those guys are probably fifteen 
		minutes away.

                        ALEX
            No.. I mean, I don't have anything 
		on me. This won't be safe.

                        CLEAR
                  (sadly)
            Nothing is... anymore.

Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.

             Keep off the highways, they'll be

Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...

                        CARTER
            Alright, Browning, you fuckin'

                  (quietly)
            Yeah.
                  (almost to himself)
            When she died... at that moment, I
            could tell she saw something... horrible.

The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...

                        CARTER
            Out of us... who's next to see it?

Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.

                        BILLY
            Please tell me I'm gonna get to see
            the Jets win the Super Bowl.

                        CARTER
            Me, right? That's why you're not 
		saying.

Billy looks out the window, despondent.

                         BILLY
            Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool,
            that time...

                         CARTER
                  (to Billy)
            Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm
            next.

                        CLEAR
            He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.

                        CARTER
            You have a responsibility to tell me.

                        ALEX
            Is knowing going to make it easier? 
		It makes it harder.

                        CARTER
            You get off havin' control over me.
            Let me choose how to deal with it.

                        ALEX
            It doesn't matter who's next...
            we're all on the same list.

The three are silent.

                        CARTER
            Aww, fuck... really?

Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado.

                        CARTER
            Then why bother? What's the fuckin'
            point? Terry and me will be back
            together on the other side, so why
            wait any longer?

Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...

EXT. AN INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The muscle car ROARS past a stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

The interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection. Alex, Clear, and Billy tenses...

                        CLEAR
            Knock it off!

                        CARTER
            May as well go out under my own
            free will, right?

                        CLEAR
            Not with us in the fuckin' car!

EXT. ANOTHER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The car GUNS IT through another stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Every passenger hangs on as the car BOUNCES from the next dip.

              CLEAR                    BILLY
          Stop it!                Hey, c'mon, man...

                        CARTER
            What's your fuckin' worry? If it's 
		not your time...? I could get nailed
		runnin' this red light and you all
            wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?

              ALEX                           CLEAR
         No!                           Knock it off!

EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

                        BILLY
            And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!

             ALEX                            CLEAR
       Carter, stop it, you          Get control of yourself!
       fuckin' maniac!!

                        CARTER
            That's what I'm doin'!

                        CLEAR
            I know what you're doing! It's 
		alright to be scared, Carter. You 
		don't have to prove to us how big 
		your balls are. Not now.

                        CARTER
            I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S 
		TIME! I control my life! I control 
		my death!

                        BILLY
            Watch it! Watch it!

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection.

TURNING CAR DRIVER'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster...

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands.

                  CLEAR                   ALEX
            Stop the car!              Let us out!

                        BILLY
            I am... so close to puking, you
            don't wanna know.

                        CLEAR
            We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're 
		not going to quit. Maybe you are. You
		act like you're not, but you are!

Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror.

                        CLEAR
            So, stop what you're doing and STOP
            THIS CAR! Right fucking now!

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.

OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW

The front crossing arm drops INTO FRAME before the car. Carter turns and flashes a "that's why I stopped" smile.

INSIDE THE CAR

                        CLEAR
            Move it!

Carter turns off the engine, then sits back into his seat and folds his arms, indicating he has no intention of moving.

                        ALEX
            Billy, get out!

Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle. From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left...

OUT OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW - BILLY'S POV

A locomotive headlight arcs across the trees... approaching.

RETURN

                 CLEAR                          ALEX
        Can't you open the door?!      Easy, Billy, just open it.

Billy collects himself...

CLOSE - BILLY'S DOOR HANDLE

POPS open!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train appears around the blind bend...

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Billy opens the door and pours out. Clear and Alex are quickly behind him. Carter remains in the drivers seat.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train WARNING WHISTLE BLOWS as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks. They quickly turn around, desperate to convince...

                        CLEAR
                  Carter, get out!

           ALEX                         BILLY
    Don't do it! Don't do it!      It's coming! It's coming!

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...

                        CARTER
            It ain't my time.

He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over... only to be met with the DULL CLACK of a dead engine.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO HIM AS his EYES FLARE with tension...

CLOSE - IGNITION

he turns it, again and again... nothing.

CARTER

looks up...

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT - CARTER'S POV - THE TRAIN

is moments away.

ALEX, CLEAR AND BILLY

assess the situation...

                     ALEX                         CLEAR
     Get out! Get out of the car!        Get out! Get out of the
     Get out of the fuckin' car!         car!

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror...

CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR

the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness.

CARTER

as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.

He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.

                        CARTER
            I can't get out!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

Alex, Billy and Clear look at one another, equally frightened...

                        BILLY
            Man, he really is next.

Alex takes off toward...

CARTER'S CAR

Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.

THE TRAIN

the WHISTLES SCREAMS!

CLEAR AND BILLY

tense, as the train nears...

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window.

CLOSE - CARTER'S SEAT BELT

the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes... the seat belt begins to TEAR.

ALEX AND CARTER

As CAMERA SWEEPS IN to ALEX and he releases a deep GROAN...

ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train TEARS THROUGH the front end of the muscular car! GLASS and METAL ERUPT as the locomotive THUNDERS THROUGH FRAME.

CLEAR AND BILLY

must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass.

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage. The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to ROAR PAST...

TRAIN TRACKS

as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.

CLEAR AND BILLY

run to the two survivors.

CLEAR

runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND BILLY

Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears.

                        CLEAR
            Scared now?

Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt.

                        CARTER
            It broke!
		
                        BILLY
            No one's that strong.

                        CLEAR
                  (to Carter)
            Bullshit. He saved your life...again!

CLOSE - TRAIN WHEELS

continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal...

RETURN

The THUNDERING TRAIN intensifies the situation...

                        BILLY
            THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE 
		NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM 
		YOU!

Billy begins backing away from the others.

                        CARTER
            SHUT UP, BILLY!

                        CLEAR
            WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!

Billy continues backing away, horrified.

                        BILLY
            I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM 
		HIM! HE'S NEXT!

CLOSE - TRAIN TRACKS

the debris rattles beneath the wheels...

CARTER AND ALEX

still on the ground...

                        CARTER
            FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!

BILLY

backing away...

                        BILLY
            YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE 
		DEAD!

TRAIN TRACKS

the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...

BILLY

                        BILLY (CONT'D)
            AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!

FWOOP! The metal tears ACROSS FRAME, ripping Billy's head from his 
shoulders.

ALEX, CLEAR AND CARTER

The ROAR of the TRAIN seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock.

EXTREMELY WIDE - ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train CLEARS FRAME and is gone... REVEALING, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.

                        CARTER
            Jesus fucking Christ!

For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.

                        ALEX
                  (to Carter)
            You should have been next. After
            Lewton, you should've been next. 
		That's the only pattern. You should 
		be dead.

                        CARTER
            You're the fuckin' devil.

                        ALEX
                  (to Clear)
            But I saved him. I intervened. Just 
		like the plane. That's the design.

                        CLEAR
            Police are coming.

                        ALEX
            That's why It skipped Carter and
            went to the next one in the path
            of the explosion; Billy.

Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            My intervention in the death of 180
            surviviors will cheat the design.

                         CARTER
            "Intervention?" What are you, God
             now?!

                          ALEX
            Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to
            die! Gods don't die! We do!

                          CLEAR
            You're losin' it. The police will be
            here. We have to go to the cabin.
            You can hide there. Get your head 
		together.

Alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...

                        ALEX
            After Billy... it's me. And then you.

Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
                  (to Clear)
            Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.

Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...

                        CARTER
            Then, get out of here.

As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.

In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...

INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE

A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.

CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.

ALEX

finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.

Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.

He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.

Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

                                                      CUT TO:

A pink circle fills THE ENTIRE FRAME.

EXTREMELY CLOSE - CLEAR'S EYES

look downward, anxious and full of thought.

A HOME PREGNANCY TEST

the results are positive, two pink dots, confirming.

WIDER

Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests. You can never be too sure. Outside, WIND of an approaching storm blows. CAMERA tensely INCHES IN ON Clear...

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CRACK BENEATH DOOR

The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.

CAMERA RISES TO ALEX, sitting in his safe chair. Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around...

ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG

the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.

ALEX

tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.

ALEX'S POV - CAN

rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.

FISHING HOOK

falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.

ALEX

is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...

THE DOOR

Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.

Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.

CLOSET FLOOR

a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

                        ALEX
                  (as if to Death)
            Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.
                  (defiant)
            I overlooked it. You tried to
            capitalize. But I caught you,
            you fuck. I can beat you. Not
            forever, but I got this cabin
            rigged to beat you NOW!

O.S., a sound. Like a THUMP near the cabin steps. He freezes, like an animal sensing danger. THUNDER RUMBLES. The light around him begins to flicker and sway.

COLEMAN LANTERN

a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.

INT. BEDROOM - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - DAY

Distant... APPROACHING THUNDER RUMBLES as she steps away. The weight of the world on her shoulders, Clear paces, considering her options. She looks to a bookshelf...

CLOSE - AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH

A man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera. Both appear happy and alive. They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods.

The photograph is turned over. On the back is marked in a young girl's handwriting, "me and dad at the cabin. 1986."

CLEAR

As CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER... considering life. Then, now and what is to come.

Weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars. Schreck is behind the wheel.

                        WEINE
            She was up there a minute ago...

A figure steps into the drivers side window, from the rear. The two agents are startled as Clear Rivers leans into FRAME. She pauses, gauging their trustworthiness, then...

                        CLEAR
            I'm not turning him in. There's
            another life that needs him now.

The two agents remain respectful...

                        CLEAR
            I go with you.

                        WEINE
            You can't.

She considers... and understands.

                        CLEAR
            Don't hurt him.

                        WEINE
            Tell us where he is. Wait at home, 
		and I promise... we'll bring him 
		back safe, in protective custody.

As she senses the agents' sincerity...

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.

A headline catches his attention. CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM, tense, while THUNDER RUMBLES. As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked... anxious... he cocks his head to consider... recalling... as CAMERA PUSHES ALL THE WAY INTO...

HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER

"PARENTS TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS." Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer.

ALEX

his expression reflects a terrifying revelation...

                        ALEX
            I... never moved. Christa asked
            me to move, but I didn't change
            seats. I would've moved up...
            next to Tod... How could I not
            remember... that... I never
            moved. Clear's seat was in front
            of mine...

CAMERA PUSHES into a TIGHT CLOSE UP...

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            She's next.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear paces in her living room. She moves to the curtains and checks out the window. Although it is not raining, LIGHTNING CRACKS across the sky!

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - POWER LINE

The lightning STRIKES the top of the pole, SNAPPING two power lines, which whip in the wind.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power goes out. The room turns dark. Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights CRACKLE. Clear moves to the window.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV - POWER LINES

ARC violently striking the ground and each other. Each line whips 
unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full. And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines. As if Death were within them.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle. Outside, BLUE ARC LIGHT CRACKLES. She looks out the backyard.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV

An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.

The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog.

Although no window is open, and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning... the candle flame whips, then extinguishes. The blue smoke swirls ominously into the room.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOTHESLINE

Sharp metal edges spin. Glinting blue arc light...

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps. O.S., SEVERAL CARS APPROACH, headlights pan across the trees. Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the F.B.I umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s THUNDER up to the cabin, siren lights swirling.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles. Schreck points out the passenger window.

                        SCHRECK
            There!

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - WEINE'S POV - THROUGH CAR WINDOW

Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.

WIDER

the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The backdoor opens. Clear charges out into the backyard.

THE DOG

Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.

CLEAR

continues to run...

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHESLINE

is whipped by a power line. SPARKS FLY as the base pole snaps in two.

CLEAR

the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHES-LINE FRAME

is rolled by the winds, across the yard toward...

ABOVE GROUND POOL

the clothesline frame punctures the pool. Water streams from the rupture.

CLEAR

reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.

THE POWER LINES

whipping, strike one another causing an angry FLASH!

THE RIVETS

holding the pool frame begin to BREAK and POP. Water floods into the yard.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him... in pursuit.

Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope...

GULLY

He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base...

ALEX

stops with a CRUNCHING THUD... his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S FEET

water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet. She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes. Clear whips up, checking the position of...

A POWER LINE

coils, like a cobra, ready to STRIKE!

TREE

Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.

                        CLEAR
            Run!

The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps...

THE POWER LINE

whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water...

CLEAR

in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back...

CLEAR'S POV - THE DOG

convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - SMALL CREEK

Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep. Alex's foot splashes in the water. THUNDER RUMBLES.

ALEX

races along the path of the stream.

SHERIFFS

continue their pursuit through the dark trees.

ABOVE

Lightning CRACKS a tree branch.  SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.

ALEX

The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned... face down in the creek.

CAMERA MOVES IN... his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles... battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water.

As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.

WIENE'S POV - FOREST

the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies. From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight.

ALEX

struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting...

WEINE AND SHERIFFS

believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVERS'S HOUSE NIGHT

Clear pulls herself up to a tree branch. Lighting and THUNDER CONTINUE amongst the ARCING, CRACKLING POWER LINES. She searches for an escape.

CLEAR'S POV - THE TREE BRANCH

extends toward the house.

CLEAR

straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch...

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - CLOSE - ALEX'S EYES

dart open. Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream.

With a DEEP GASP, he does so. Drinking up the air. It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch.

He pauses only for a couple gulps of air... and is off.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. WINDOW - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house. With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, ARCING, at her feet.

                                                        CUT TO:

Weine RUNS INTO FRAME, looks around, frustrated...

            Lost him.

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - SCHRECK

deperately scans the area.

The power lines strike the rooftop.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear River's stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light. Her television screen BLOWS OUT. Sparks jet across the room. Blasts of FLAME erupt from the electrical outlets. She quickly turns, racing toward the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA IS LOW, RACING WITH HER as SPARKS EXPLODE FROM the lamps and electrical outlets. She cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase...

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS/BACKYARD - NIGHT

Alex tears across the fenceless backyards towards Clear's house. Blue ARC light glowing from the front yard.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A mid-eighties Corolla is parked amongst Clear's artwork. A door, adjacent to the kitchen flies open. Clear hustles through, running to the car and entering via the passenger door, for the sake of expediency.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power lines WHACK angerily against the door.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear scoots into the driver's seat. She CLICKS the automatic garage door opener...

GARAGE DOOR OPENER MOTER

connected to a metal arm, attached to the door, remains motionless - there is no power.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Realizing the motor is dead, Clear takes a beat, STARTS THE ENGINE and SHIFTS INTO REVERSE...

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex reaches the backyard. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation. HE RUNS OUT OF FRAME...

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear guns the small car in reverse.

GARAGE DOOR

as the rear of the car makes impact with the door...

THE GARAGE OPENER

trembles, the long metal arm collapses, falls...

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BAM! In reverse, the Corolla SMASHES through the garage door.

THE METAL ARM
of the garage door opener RIPS through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille. The other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially acting as an anchor.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

The car SHUDDERS, wheels spinning uselessly, as the arm "holds" onto the car.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - DOOR OPENER MOTER

the screws holding the arm to the ceiling begin to pull away...

A METAL CAN

on a shelf, is rocked as, O.S., the CAR rattles the garage, trying to break free. The can is marked "TURPENTINE: EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE." The can tumbles over the shelf.

GARAGE FLOOR

the can SMACKS on the floor, edgewise, REVREALING the can is sealed tight with a cap.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - POWER LINE

thick cable ARCS, snapping toward the car INTO FRAME.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Foot to the floor, Clear SCREAMS for the car to move.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - DOOR OPENER MOTOR

pulls away from the ceiling.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Corolla lurches backward, freed from the grasp of the house.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

a chunk of the ceiling collapses upon Clear's artworks, including the canvas incorporating a jagged piece of debris from Flight 180. The metal SLAMS to the floor, on top of...

THE CAN OF TURPENTINE

which causes the flammable liquid to stream out, toward the driveway.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

As the Corolla lurches away from the house down the sloped driveway...

THE POWER LINE

THUDS upon Clear's car.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

An ear splitting CRACKLE. SPARKS FLY! The electrical system of the samll car erupts and the engine dies. The car stops.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

From the rear of the house appears Alex. CAMERA SWEEPS IN ON HIM as he reacts to the situation...

                        ALEX
            Don't move!

WIDER

The power line sadistically rests atop the automobile. The exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cat's tail, SPARKING, CRACKLING, as it hits the ground.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear looks up desperately to Alex.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex extends his hands. O.S., CARS approach THUNDEROULSY...

                        ALEX
            You're grounded in the car. Don't
            touch anything. DON'T MOVE.

IN THE STREET

The unmarked F.B.I. vehicle and two sheriff patrol cars pull up on the street. Schreck and Weine hustle out of the car.

                        WEINE
            Alex, get away from there!

                        SCHRECK
            Any part of that line touches you,
            you're dead.

THE POWER LINE

SNAPS in ALEX'S DIRECTION.

ALEX

lurches back...

THE STREAM OF TURPINTINE

is ignited by a single spark fom the power line. It flows toward the car.

ALEX

backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.

CLEAR

keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME...

ALEX

reacts, shocked. He realizes...

WIDER

the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

step forward...

THE POWER LINE

atop the car, whips, ARCS, warning everyone away.

IN THE COROLLA

Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out.

CLEAR'S POV - GARAGE WALL

The fire roars angrily in the f.g., on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears.

ALEX

steps closer...

                        ALEX
                  NO!

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car...

SCHRECK AND WEINE

                        WEINE
            Get back! You'll both die!

ALEX AND CLEAR

hearing this, Alex's mind is made up. He looks to Clear.

                        ALEX
            You know what to do.

                        CLEAR
            No! No! Don't!

                        ALEX
            When I do this.. it'll have skipped 
		you... and it'll all be over.

At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared...

                        ALEX
            You know what to do. I'll always be 
		with you.

He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.

COROLLA

Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.

ALEX

is engulfed in the flames.

ALEX'S POV - THE SHADOWS

the edges of the FRAME are collapsing. Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay...

ALEX

through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image...

                        ALEX
            NO!

He looks toward...

CLEAR - ALEX'S POV

She... is the last sight he'll ever see.

WIDER

The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway.

CLEAR

Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car.

                        SCHRECK
            Is he alive?

CLEAR'S EYES

flash open, horrified, answering the question...

THE SKY

a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right.

CLEAR - OVERHEAD

As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl. CAMERA MOVES DOWN TO HER FACE, her eyes opened... welling with tears... seeming to realize... to sense, he is gone.

                        DOCTOR
            A little more. Little more!

CLEAR

THE DOCTOR

cuts the umbilical cord.

                        DOCTOR
            He's here. A beautiful boy.

CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA

smile and fight back the tears. Clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears.

                        CLEAR
            I felt him! When the baby was
            born... I felt Alex pass through me...
            like the night he died...

Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor...

CLEAR'S POV - THE BABY

covered in goop, eyes shut... a new life arrives.

DOCTOR

looks at the clock and reprots to an attending nurse. Another nurse cleans up the baby, wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet.

Barabra places a cool wet cloth on Clear's forehead...

                        BARBARA
            Exactly a year... to the minute.

Everyone recognizes the eerie, yet beautiful coincidence. Clear leans her haed back, relieved, euphoric...

                        CLEAR
            We beat it, Alex.

Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...

WRIST BRACLET

"Alexander Chance Browning II."

DELIVERY ROOM

CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.

As "Long May You Run" OVERLAPS...

A bright, colorful arrangment of flowers is carefully placed into a vase. CAMERA ADJUSTS to REVEAL Alex's bedroom is now lived in by Clear and the baby. Clear makes the final adjustment in the arrangement, then checks the sleeping baby in the bassinet.

Clear moves to her bed with a book. As she settles in, O.S., a faint RUSTLE. CAMERA INCHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks to...

CLEAR'S POV - THE FLOWERS

a soft breeze causes the petals to flutter...

CLEAR

CLEAR'S POV - THE FAN

CLEAR

looks across the room...

CLEAR'S POV - THE ROOM

The breeze moves through the flowers... billows the cutains, posters and photos on the wall... until seemingly settling over the bassinet. The lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze, it is hovering over the child.

CLEAR

CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here... and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes.

THE BABY

the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving. Before it fully departs...

CLEAR

the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear. He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room.

CLEAR'S POV - ON THE WALL

A hand ENTERS FRAME, fingers hover in space before they gently trace over "Terry Chaney." CAMERA ADJUSTS TO REVEAL Carter Horton, staring at the name. Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller.

Carter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear.

                        CARTER
            Alex was right.

Clear looks up.

                        CARTER (CONT'D)
            It did skip us.

Clear smiles. As she takes the baby out of the stroller...

            I believe... that's what Alex
            believed. But how do we know... this
            wasn't the design all along?

Clear holds baby Alex up to the monument, showing her son his father's name. Carter stands, watching. CAMERA WIDENS to REVEAL the entire monument against the deep blue sky. At the base in readable, but understandable lettering... "FLIGHT 180."

CAMERA HOLDS as "Long May You Run" CONTINUES... RETURNING each of us to the awaiting darkness.

By James Wong and Glen Morgan



January 15, 1999



Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place.
Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable
inevitability......it will arrive.

The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die."

As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING!
A CRACK OF THUNDER!

"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:

AN OLD TABLE FAN

swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...

A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.

THE TABLE FAN

TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...

THE TABLE FAN

swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.

CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.

TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN

There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.

THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES

stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.

            Alex...

CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."

One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;
"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"
Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.

            he's picking you up at 10 in the

Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.


                        KEN
            My suitcase workin' out for ya?

Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.

            Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave
            that on. It's like... the tag
            made the last flight without
            crashin' or anything, right?
            So, it should stay on, or with,
            the bag for good luck.

                        BARBARA
            Where would you get a nutball
            idea like that?


EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER

is torn away from the suitcase handle.

RETURN

As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.

                        KEN
            I'm still here.

Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad.

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Seventeen and on the loose. Ten 
		days in Paris. In the springtime! 
		Live it up, Alex...

CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son...

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Got your whole life ahead of you.

ALEX

CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously...

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - LATER

The storm has ceased. The room is QUIET.

As if itself a presence, CAMERA CREEPS across the dark and motionless room TOWARD Alex, sleeping soundly. CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the level of the bed until Alex is in the f.g. and the room is visible behind him.

On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.

Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...

THE WINDOWS

which... are closed.

ALEX

puzzled, checks...

THE TABLE FAN

which is off.

ALEX

perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however... the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read... 1:80.

CAMERA ADJUSTS FROM the "Arrival-Departure Schedule" to REVEAL forty high school KIDS, four TEACHERS and several PARENTS are gathered inside the International terminal at J.F.K. Several of the students wear Fighting Colonial leterman's jackets or hats and shirts displaying "Mt. Abraham High, New York."

            You are not required to give money

Alex gathers his bags, as does his best friend TOD WAGGNER and his older brother GEORGE WAGGNER, standing before their father, JERRY WAGGNER. For Alex, any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip.

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Alright, you guys got everything?

                        TOD
            Yeah, we're all set Dad.

MR. MURNAU, the French teacher (any further description necessary?) and leader of the class trip waves his arm.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Les estudients, allons en France!

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Does that mean "go?"

Tod shrugs, "I guess" as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye. Mr. Waggner then gives his older son a hug.

                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.

             I'll miss you guys.

Tod and George gives a wave, as does Alex, who is slapped on the back by Mr. Waggner.

                        MR. WAGGNER
             Take care of those two, Alex.

                        ALEX
             I will. Don't worry.

The group begins down the airport toward the check-in counter. In the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, CLEAR RIVERS, 17, reading the TROPIC OF CANCER. The loner in the group, Clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. She appears aloof and more wordly then the other students.

Readying his ticket and documents, Tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.

                        TOD
           I didn't think anything could
           worse than my yearbook picture.

                        GEORGE

           Avis aux passagers...

Mr. Murnau stops the group. Excited, he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Entendez classe, qu'est ce que
            c'est l'announce?

Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen.

CARTER HORTON

is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband...

                        CARTER
                 (re: MURNAU)
            What the fuck's he want?

Terry, hot now, but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years, smiles obsequiously and mouths "shh."

                        P.A. SYSTEM (O.S., CONT'D)
            cher aeroport n'est responsable
            pour leurs activities.

Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as...

                        CLEAR
            The airport doesn't endorse 
		solicitors.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!

She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the 
procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs...

                        ALEX
            Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with 
		that shit the whole time?

A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose.

                        HARE KRISHANA
            Death is not the end.

CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY.

As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies.

                        MS. LEWTON
            It will be for you if you harass
            my students.

She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group.

                 (pissy)

Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile...

                 (mouths)
            Fuck off.

As she turns her back and continues down the terminal...

INT. CHECK IN DESK - AIRPORT - DAY

Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport...

                        TICKET CLERK
            I have a few questions to ask you 
		this afternoon.

O.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK.

                        TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
            Did you pack these bags yourself?

The CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward.

ALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

Plastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... "CANCELLED."

ALEX

CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia...

                        TICKET CLERK (CONT'D, O.S.)
            Have your belongings remained in your
            possession the entire time?

Alex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to...

ALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

The plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... "DEPARTED."

TICKET DESK

Alex is still considering the "messages..."

                         TICKET CLERK
            Have you recieved any packages
            from persons unknown to you?

Alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward...

CLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE

a new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag.

RETURN

Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.

                        TICKET CLERK
            Same as your birthday.

Alex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, "pardon me?" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket...

                         TICKET CLERK (CONT'D)
            April 25th. Four-twenty-five...
            your birthday is the same as your

CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward...

ALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD

INT.  SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR

The ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches.

Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust.

                        BILLY
            I can't believe they let that 
		dickhead on this trip.

                        GEORGE
            His parents bought a ton of those 
		trip certificates we had to sell, 
		just to get him out of their hair

Excited, Tod speaks in a convert tone over Alex's shoulder.

                        TOD
            Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk
            so you're sittin' next to Christa 
		and I'm next to Blake.

Alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors...

ALEX'S POV - TWO GIRLS

Attractive and they know it, CHRISTA MARSH and BLAKE DREYER appear clearly out of Alex and Tod's league.

                        TOD (CONT'D)
            That's seven hours and most of it is 
		in the dark.

ALEX AND TOD

The boys dump their change in a plastic bowl.

                        TOD
            Dude, if we don't get someone
            going on this flight, we should
            just call Dr. Kervorkian and put
            ourselves out of our fuckn' misery.

As Alex and Tod pass through the metal detector, their eyes performing reconnaissance on Christa and Blake, the opening drum BLASTS of Boingo's "No One Lives Forever" OVERLAPS...

CAMERA ADJUSTS from the sign indicating GATE 39. The class is squirrely and  excited. Mr. Murnau, Ms. Lewton, and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate, hoping for a calm flight.

CAMERA MOVES ALONG the awaiting passengers... Carter and Terry are making out, a step away from heavy petting...

Blake and Christa are flipping through Parisian fashion magizines... Billy Hitchcock lays into a Burrito Supreme...

CAMERA MOVES to an empty seat. Clear Rivers ENTERS FRAME and sits, 
struggling with her Walkman, coffee, books, and a cassette box handmarked "Boingo" (a cheat that We hear the song)

As she places her stuff on the unoccupied seat beside her, a Paris guidebook falls on the floor, opened but face down. A passing, unidentified, student reaches down and hands her the book, still open and face down.

                        CLEAR
            Thanks.

The student continues down toward the observation deck. Clear looks at the opened guidebook.

CLEAR'S POV - GUIDEBOOK

Princess Di's Mercedes is totaled in a Paris tunnel. Besides the photo are two portraits of Diana and Dodi Al Fayed.

CLEAR

CAMERA INCHES IN as she shakes off a shiver down her spine. She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully REVEALED to be Alex Browning.

He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane.

ALEX'S POV - 747

It is raining. In the distance, MUFFLED THUNDER RUMBLES.

CAMERA CREEPS AWAY from the plane... huge, seemingly incapable of flight and yet we unquestioningly trust our lives in this machine. Emotionless. Cold. Lifeless, and yet soon full of life.

ALEX

CAMERA inches in on him.

                        TOD (O.S.)
            Dude, let's take a dump.

Tod MOVES INTO FRAME beside Alex...

                        ALEX
           	Man, that is one George Michael
           	notch from being gay.

           	Dude, get wisdom. We're about to

            a wicked cable and then right after

            Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39.

             Vingt huit, vingt neuf...

PASSENGER RAMP

Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane.

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE

The enormous engine. The expansive wings. Behind the tail, distant, a bolt of lightning FLASHES!

ALEX

            Could you trade seats with Blake
            so she and I can sit together? I
            asked Tod, but he says he's got some

ALEX

sneaks a quick check with Tod.

ALEX'S POV - TOD

shakes his head. "NO! NO! DON'T DO IT."

ALEX AND THE GIRLS

He looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched. Alex shrugs, "Sure." In front of him Tod throws up his arms, disgusted. Alex climbs out of his seats. The girls are touchy-feely thankful, but only know guys dig that.

                        CHRISTA AND BLAKE
            You're so sweet. Thanks, Alex.

Alex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22 H.

Alex climbs over Tod to take the window seat. Clear Rivers sits in the seat directly behind Alex.

As Alex sits, the tray table falls from its upright position.

He lifts the tray back up, but as he turns the latch, it BREAKS OFF in his hand. He briefly tries to jimmie the tray into postition, then gives up.

CAMERA FOLLOWS ALEX'S HAND as it rises. CAMERA SWEEPS IN EXTREAMLY CLOSE to the ATTENDANT CALL BUTTON. As Alex's finger engages the button, it lights up orange.

ALEX

The ENGINES WHIR as the jet gathers SPEED. He checks the window.

ALEX'S POV- THE RUNWAY

is a blur. The airport terminals in the b.g. streak past. The wings lift, angled as the jet leaves the ground.

ALEX

O.S., his classmates CHEER and "raise the roof." The trip has begun.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing...

The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then...

The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.

ALEX'S POV - THE CABIN

Passengers SCREAM! Unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft INTO CAMERA, which BUFFETS and SHAKES...

OXYGEN MASKS

deploy from the overhead compartments. A prerecorded message, like that recorded by the black box of the crash of JAL# 123 August 12, 1985, BLARES over the P.A., with erie calm...

                        MESSAGE (V.O.)
            Fasten seat belts...put on oxygen 
		masks...

ALEX

his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window.

ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW

The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin.

ALEX

breaths deep into his oxygen cup.

The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS.

Then...

KA-BOOM

A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.

Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.

Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.

Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.

ALEX AND TOD

SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.

OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down.

ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME...

                                              CUT TO:

CLOSE - ALEX'S TERRIFIED EYES

dilating rapidly, as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche.

                        CHRISTA (O.S.)
            Alex?

ALEX

Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.

                        CHRISTA
            Could you trade seats with Blake so
		she and I can sit together? I asked 
		Tod, but he's got some medical thing.

Alex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned.

                        TOD
            Dude, what up?

Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row.

ALEX

grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
            Is there a a problem, sir?

Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode.

Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions.

                        CARTER
            What's your fuckin' problem?

Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex.

                        MR. MURNAU
            Alex? Qu'est-ce se?

                        ALEX
            Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA
            EXPLODE!

Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense.

THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

immediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin.

CARTER AND TERRY

               CARTER                TERRY
        Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny.

ALEX

frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle.

                        ALEX
            We have to get out!

This frightens everyone. Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            We have to get off this plane!

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            Now! NOW!!

RETURN

Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend. Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force.

                  	CARTER
	      Sit! DOWN! Browning!

               TOD                             FLIGHT ATTENDANT
    Alex. Alex! Easy, man. Take it        Sir, if this is a joke,
    easy.                                 we don't tolerate such 
							humor.

The flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm.

                             ALEX
                I'm not joking! I'm not joking!

Ms. Lewton and Mr. Murnau move to the seats. Flight attendants try 
restraining Alex from reaching the aisle.

           MS. LEWTON               	       MR. MURNAU
  Alex, Knock it off. It's alright.       Settle down, Alex.

                        ALEX
		Listen to me! This plane will 
		explode on take-off!

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
            Sir, we will remove you from the
            aircraft if this continues.

                        CARTER
            I'll remove him.

                         ALEX
            Fuck you! I'll remove myself!

Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.

The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.

A male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well.

                        TERRY
            He didn't do nothin'!

She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend.

Just arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a 
STEWARDESS to get to his seat. He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out.

                        FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                  (he's had it)
            Anybody in the aisle is off the 
		plane!

                        BILLY
            No, wait, I was late... that's my 
		seat right there!

Under protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane. Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles.

          MS. LEWTON                       MR. MURNAU
   Everybody just stay where you    Mr. Carpenter, keep an eye on
   are. Just sit tight.             things for a moment.

Tod watches, amazed and concerned for his friend. He looks across the cabin to...

TOD'S POV - GEORGE

his brother gestures, mouths... "you should go with him."

TOD

starts off down the aisles. CAMERA COUNTERS... ADJUSTING TO CLEAR RIVERS. Amongst the chaos, she considers for a beat, then grabs her backpack, stands and moves into the aisle to exit the plane.

                                               CUT TO:

INT. BOARDING AREA/TUNNEL - GATE 39 - DAY

Alex, the co-pilot, Carter, the attendant, Mr. Murnau, Ms, Lewton, Terry, Tod and Billy proceed down the tunnel. Billy is confused by the chaos.

                        BILLY
            I didn't do anything! I have my 
		ticket right here!

Arriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers.

                        CO-PILOT
            You got this?

The officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter.

The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive.

                        CO-PILOT
            No one gets back on board. That's my 
		call.

                        MS. LEWTON
            PLEASE... I've got forty students 
		going to Paris...

During these negotiations... CAMERA MOVES PAST Ms. Lewton and the Co-Pilot to the boarding ramp door...

Clear Rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others, aware she is unnoticed in the confusion. CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up toward...

ALEX

CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.

                        TOD
            It's alright. It's alright. You're 
		off the plane. You're off the 
		plane...

Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau.

                        MS. LEWTON
             Airline's not taking this very well.
             They'll let one of us back on and
             the rest can grab a six-ten flight.
             Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle.
             It's alright. It's not that big of a
             deal.

                        MR. MURNAU
            I'll stay.

	                  MS. LEWTON
            No, you know the whole French thing. 
		Get on the plane.

Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau.

                        BILLY
            I was in the bathroom. The lock was 
		stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!

Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD.

EXT. GATE 39 - AFTERNOON - CARTER, TERRY & BILLY'S POV

Flight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway.

INT. GATE 39 - OBSERVATION WINDOW - AFTERNOON

Carter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton.

MENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39

Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead.

                        TOD
            I called your mom and dad and 
		they're on their way.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Alex, talk to me. What happened?

Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him...

                        ALEX
            I... I saw it... like, I don't
            know... the plane took off. I saw
            it leave the runway... I looked down
            and saw the ground...

Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            And then the cabin banged and the
            left side exploded. The the whole
            plane... blew up. It was so real.
            Exactly how everything goes.

                         TOD
            Been on many planes that blew up, 
		have you?

Good point. Alex looks away.

                         MS. LEWTON
            You must have fallen asleep.

                         CARTER
            We get thrown off the plane and blow 
		a half day in Paris because Browning 
		has a bad dream?
                 (mocking Alex)
            It's going to explode! It's going to 
		explode!

                        TOD
            Fuck off, Horton.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Tod...

A raw nerve, Alex stands.

                        ALEX
            Only trip you're gonna take is to 
		the fuckin' hospital.

Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex.

Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal.

OBSERVATION DECK

CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off...

                        BILLY
            There they go and here we stay.

AIRPORT TERMINAL

One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway.

                        CARTER
             You're payin' for my trip, Browning!

                        ALEX
             I wish you were on the plane!

In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame.

It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window...

ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180

The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky.

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him.

GATE 39

Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out.

O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy.

CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him.

CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

SILENCE

A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance.

The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.

ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM

Ms. Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex. Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder.

ALEX

frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength...

                        ALEX
            You're lookin' at me as if I caused 
		it. I did not cause this.

LEWTON, CARTER, TERRY, AND BILLY

maintain their uncertain expressions. With strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Is everyone dead? Are there any
            survivors?

WIDER

Alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.

                        ALEX
            How would I know? You think I'm
            some sort of...

                        CLEAR
            He's not a witch.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Alex, relieved and thankful, as he turns to her...

CLEAR RIVERS - ALEX'S POV

CAMERA MATCHES the move INTO HER as she looks up at Alex, not with fear or repulsion... but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection.

WIDER

Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten.

A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team."

The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.

                        SEIGEL
            Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National
            Transportation Safety Board vice
            chairmen. We've notified your families
            and they are on their way. Does anyone
            feel they need medical attention or
            spiritual counseling at this time?

Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. Ms. Lewton reacts, snapping...

                        MS. LEWTON
            Have they found any survivors?
            What's going on?

Seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.

                        SEIGEL
            The cause of the explosion is 
		undetermined. Nassau county
		authorities are on the scene. Naval
	      search and rescue are en route.

He gestures... "and that's all we know." The group slips deeper into despair.

                        WEINE
            We understand how you must be
            feeling at this hour... and although
            we know it may be difficult, we must
            ask you some questions... regarding
            today's events, while it's still
            fresh in your minds.

The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate.

                        WEINE
            It may be valuable to our rescue
            attempts, or any potential...
            criminal investigation.

The agents, F.B.I. badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward Alex.

ALEX

reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him...

INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - CLOSE - SCHRECK & WEINE

are direct and professional, with no hidden agenda in searching for the truth. Seigel and Hawks from the NTSB are behind them taking notes...

                        SCHRECK
            You said...
                  (checks notes)
            "Listen to me! This plane will
            explode on take-off."
                  (to Alex)
            How did you know that?

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous... not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.

                        ALEX
            I got this... feeling... a weird
            feeling... I can't explain it...

                        WEINE
            Did you take any seditives before
            boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping
            pills?

                        ALEX
            No. I saw it. I saw it!

Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience. Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk.

                        ALEX
            Not like a dream... more than that.
		I experienced the plane exploding... 
		it was so horrible... I know what 
		they all went through tonight...

The officers remain quiet, gauging his explanation.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            I'm not a pyschic... I've never had
            this happen before...

The officers study him, unsure yet carefully...

                        SCHRECK
            Did this "weird feeling" have
            anything to do with you saying
            you wished Carter Horton was on the
            plane... just before it exploded?

Alex looks up, stunned. He didn't even recall this until now.

                        ALEX
            No!

                        SCHRECK
            Why'd you say it?

He considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes...

                        ALEX
            Because... I... never thought it 
		would really happen.

Weine leans foward...

                        WEINE
            If that's the case, Alex... why did 
		you really get off the plane?

CAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional...

                        WEINE
            No one forced you to get off the
            plane. You told us you aren't friends
            with any that did... so, why did you
            leave the airplane?

CLEAR RIVERS

CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve...

                        CLEAR
            Because I saw and I heard Alex.
            And... I believed him.

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL BUILDING - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT

The surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale.

Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child.

Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others.

ALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY

Their parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image.

ALEX

his eyes moves toward...

CLEAR RIVERS

alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home.

ALEX

his eyes find...

TOD AND HIS FATHER

JERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation.

ALEX

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER!

INT. KEN BROWNING'S CAR - NIGHT

Alex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages.

Alex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up.

                        CLEAR
            Here's good.

The car pulls over.

                        CLEAR
            Thank you for the ride.
				
She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS...

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room.

ALEX

stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - PENNANT

Mt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials.

ALEX

and now, the tears arrive. He begins crying, SOBBING, as his mother and father hold him. O.S., OUTSIDE... lighting FLASHES... THUNDER RUMBLES...

INT. LIVING ROOM - BROWNING HOUSE - NIGHT - TV

CNN broadcasts video footage of the disaster. Seat cushions and personal belongings float in the harsh floodlights.

LIVING ROOM

It is late and dark. Only the pale light of the TV spills across the living room. Ken and Barbara have fellen asleep, but their son remains awake.

Alex's red eyes are locked on the screen, mortified. O.S., a VICIOUS CRACK of LIGHTNING and immediate THUNDER... as if calling Alex to the window. He remains fixed on the TV.

ALEX'S POV - TV

An image of Hell as jet fuel burns on the ocean. O.S., as if furious at the slight, THUNDER BANGS...

ALEX

He turns, stands... and moves to the picture window, pulling the curtains aside as CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM...

ALEX'S POV - THE STORM

It is as if Nature is angry. Lightning BOLTS spiderweb across the sky. THUNDER BOOMS.

A shard of lightning breaks across the front yard. Oddly, it does not make contact. In the split-second strobe of lightning flash, the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at Alex.

ALEX

horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen. Just felt on the ROAR OF THUNDER...

                                             CUT TO BLACK:

Over black:

                        MINISTER (V.O.)
            Thirty-nine days have passed since
            we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones,
            friends, and teachers.

FADE IN:

EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - CLOSE - ALEX

wearing a dark suit and tie, sits beside his parents on white folded chairs. His head is bowed, guilty and sad...

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            As each day passes without a
            determining cause for the accident,
            we ask ourselves, "Why?"

Alex raises his eyes and looks across the ceremony...

ALEX'S POV - TOD

sits with his mother, LINDA WAGGNER and his father, Jerry. Destraught, Jerry stares off blankly at the minister.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more 
		knows his time than fish taken in 
		the fatal net...

ALEX

guiltily averts his eyes. Ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...or birds trapped in the snare...

Alex checks over his shoulder.

ALEX'S POV - OVER HIS SHOULDER - LAST ROW OF SEATS

Special agents Schreck and Weine subtly survey the area, taking notes. Although their eyes are beyond sunglasses, the tilt of their head indicates they are watching Alex.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...like these the children of men...

ALEX

turns away, tense. He looks at the minister.

                         MINISTER (CONT'D)
            ...caught when the Time falls
            suddenly upon them."

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, feeling eyes upon them. He looks up...

ALEX'S POV - CLEAR RIVERS

is actually sexy and a bit scandalous in her black dress. Still, she is off by herself, eyes burning at Alex as if challenging him to challenge the words being spoken.

ALEX

self-consciously turns away, unable to face her, let alone the words being spoken.

                        MINISTER (CONT'D O.S.)
            And so before we can heal, before we 
		can escape the presence of Death
		Time, we must mourn and celebrate
            theirs with this memorial.

WIDER

A student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone. Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run."

Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed. The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial.

MEMORIAL LINE

Carter and Terry appear IN FRAME. Terry holds a rose. As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them. Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him.

                        CARTER
            Hope you don't think, Browning, that 
		because my name ain't on this wall... 
		that I owe you anything.

                        ALEX
            I don't.

                        CARTER
                  (re: victims)
            All I owe is these people.
                  (turns to Alex)
            To live my life to the fullest.

Alex winces from Carter's breath...

                        ALEX
            Then maybe you should lay off the 
		J.D.

Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold.

                        CARTER
            Don't ever fucking again tell me 
		what to do. I control me. Not you.

Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release.

                        CARTER
            I'm never gonna die.

He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off.

Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line.

                        BILLY
            I took my driver's test this week at
		the DMV...

Alex turns to him, increudlously..

                        BILLY
            Got a 70. Lowest score, but I 
		passed. When I was done with the 
		test, the guy who drives with you
		during the test, he goes, "Young 
		man, you're going to die at a 
		very young age."
                 (beat)
            That true?
		
                        ALEX
            Not here, not now.
                 (beat)
            Not EVER!

Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER...

                        BILLY
            If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will 
		she say "no?"

Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial.

Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names...

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell.

RETURN

Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain....

                        ALEX
            Ms. Lewton...

Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him.

                        MS. LEWTON
            Don't talk to me. You scare the hell
            out of me.

Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial.

                        TOD
                 (a greeting)
            Hey.

Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line...

                        ALEX
            I don't want to sound gay, or
            nothin, but... I miss you.

Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial.

CLOSE - MEMORIAL

Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER.

RETURN

As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.

                        TOD
            Me, too.
                  (beat)
            But my dad doesn't understand. When 
		he's better; you and me, road trip 
		to the City. Catch the Yanks.

                        ALEX
            That's a plan.

Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium.

                        TOD
            I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton
            showed me in her class, they're 
		gonna let me read it. It says what 
		I'm feeling.

Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled.

                        CLEAR
            Because of you... I'm still alive. 
		Thank you.

Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower.

                        TOD (V.O.)
            We say that the hour of death
            cannot be forecast...

Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve. CAMERA PUSHES IN, at an ominous ANGLE and rhythm, to the podium.

                        TOD (CONT'D)
            But when we say this, we imagine 
		that the hour is placed in an 
		obscure and distant future.

As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow.

ALEX

looks up at the sky...

THE SKY - ALEX'S POV

Within the deep blue, a single black cloud blocks the sun.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN as, troubled, he looks back to Tod...

TOD

            This afternoon... which is so

INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

A lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair." Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor. Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents...

Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs.

ALEX

sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and... REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy.

Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.

An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled...

ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO

Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and 
mysterious.

ALEX

closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.

Alight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat.

Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.

As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not 
understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door.

The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.

BACK OF THE TOILET TANK

Tod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe.

As the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle. Drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor.

Odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral.

ALEX

studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however...

A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!

ALEX'S POV - WINDOW

An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature.

WIDER

Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off.

THE TABLE FAN

A PIECE OF PAPER

torn form the magazine flits across the room.

ALEX

CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over...

Tod's hand ENTER FRAME. The scissors, sadistically just out of reach.

TOD'S FACE

FALLS INTO FRAME, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth.

TOD'S POV - DEATH

all four edges of FRAME appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center. Then, from within the center... appears Tod's face. Although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish, until... suddnely, shockingly... Tod's face decays, as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into 72 FRAMES.

TOD

The moment of realization...

HIS FEET

kick upon the slippery basin. After a beat... they stop.

TOD

As his body settles... dies... CAMERA PULLS AWAY fully revealing his lifeless form. Once behind the toilet tank, CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the floor. The water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.

The boy franically moves to a paramedic.

            What happened? Is Tod alright?

SCHRECK AND WEINE

hearing this, they turn to one another, with an expression suggesting a deepening suspicion.

ALEX

sees the officers. Assuming they are sympathetic to his concern, he starts toward them, until...

                        CLEAR (O.S.)
            Alex!

Alex stops, looks around. Behind the tree and in the shadows of the adjacent house, stands Clear Rivers.

                 (a warning)
            Get outta here!

CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house.

ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY

is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard.

ALEX

is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby.

                        ALEX
            What... what happened?

Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly.

                        MR. WAGGNER
            Didn't you... "see" it?

Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction.

                        MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D)
            Couldn't you "predict" it?
            Couldn't you read his mind?
		
Alex remains silent, hurt.

                        ALEX
            Mr. Waggner...

                        MR. WAGGNER
            You caused Tod so much guilt over 
		George staying on the plane that...
                 (breaking down)
            He took his own life.

Alex is stunned, defensive.

                              ALEX
                  He wouldn't do it!

Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof."

                        ALEX
            He... he told me we would be friends
            again after you got better. After 
		you got over George. Why would he 
		make plans for the future if he were 
		planning on killing himself?

                        MR. WAGGNER
            All my wife and I will ever know is 
		we wouldn't have lost our youngest 
		son... if you'd told our oldest to 
		get off the plane.

Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle.

The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers.

ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD

Clear is gone.

FRONT YARD

everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend...

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE - LEAVES ON TREES

A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk.

A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  "...Tod."

                        CLEAR  (O.S.)
            Almost Autumn.

Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.

                        ALEX
            It's only the end of June.

                        CLEAR
                  (shrugs)
            Yeah, but everthing's always in
            transition. If you focus, even now, 
		one week into summer... you can feel 
		Autumn coming.
                  (beat)
            Almost like bein' able... to see the 
		future.

Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.

INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY

Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.

                        CLEAR
            Know what this is?

She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.

                        ALEX
            Like, um... you're mad about
            something?

She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.

                        CLEAR
            A piece of debris... from the plane. 
		I went to the shore off the crash 
		site and it washed up on the beach.

                        ALEX
            You went there? I've wanted to go 
		there, but I thought it was off 
		limits.

                        CLEAR
            It is. But that didn't stop me.
            Shouldn't stop you.

Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...

                        ALEX
            Why were you there last night?

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...

                        CLEAR
            Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
            the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
            suicides. But they were there last 
		night, that means: one, they still 
		don't have a clue what caused the 
		crash. Two, they haven't ruled out 
		anything. And the fact that seven
            people got off the plane is probably 
		weird enough, not to mention, that 
		one of those people had a vision, or 
		whatever, of it exploding minutes 
		before it did explode, is highly
            suspicious. And it doesn't help that 
		the visionaries' friend just 
		committed suicide.

Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.

                        ALEX
            Why were you there last night?

Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.

                         CLEAR
            Know what this is?

Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."

                         CLEAR
            It's you.

Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.

                         CLEAR
            Not a likeness. It's how you make 
		me feel, Alex.

                         ALEX
            I'm... really sorry.

                         CLEAR
            Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
            know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
            to take form. And, yet, creating an
            absolute but incomprehansible 
		attraction.

Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.

                         CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Before that day, you were just 
		another suburban nothing that would 
		never have anything to do with my 
		life. And I'm sure you thought I was 
		some Marilyn Manson body-pierced 
		freak, or whatever.
                       (beat)
            But at that moment... on the plane... 
		I felt what you felt. I didn't know 
		where all those emotions were coming 
		from until you started freaking out.

Alex sighs, embarrassed.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            I didn't see what you saw, but I
		felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that 
		X-Files bullshit... but it was a 
		psychic connection. Why to me? Why 
		to you?

Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.

                        CLEAR
            And you can still feel it, can't 
		you? Something from that day is 
		still with you. I know, because I 
		can still feel you.

Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...

                        CLEAR
            That's why I was there last night.

                        ALEX
            I've never dealt with death before.
            I wasn't alive when my grandparents
            died. I wish I could know. I mean, 
		all this... could just be in our 
		heads. Now it feels like it's 
		everywhere.

                        CLEAR
            "It?"
				
                        ALEX
            What if Tod... is just the first...
            of us?

The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
				
                        CLEAR
            Is that something you're "feeling?"

                        ALEX
            I don't know. I wish I could just see
            him... one more time, then, maybe... 
		I would know.

                        CLEAR
            Then, let's go see him!

Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. FUNERAL HOME - FOYER - NIGHT

CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear...

The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window.

Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet.

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY."

                        CLEAR
                  (whispering)
            Gives me a rush...

                        ALEX
            This place?!

                        CLEAR
            Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.

With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.

A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.

                        CLEAR
            Good call. Very "Quincy."

Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.

From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!

INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.

As Alex and Clear approach...

                        ALEX
            That... him?

                        CLEAR
            I think. But why'd they make him
            up like... Michael Jackson?

                        ALEX
            That's him, but... he's not here. 
		That... whatever... that whatever 
		made him Tod is gone.

Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...

            ALEX                         CLEAR
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!
asshole. You think this        He's not dead? 
is funny, you fucking 
dick? Tod, if you're 
not dead I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

                        MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.)
            Please don't yell...
		
Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You'll wake the dead.

He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth..

                        ALEX
            Why..?

Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            Chemicals in the vascular flush
            create cadaveric spasm.

As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.

                        ALEX
            I'm... a friend of his. His best
            friend. See, his father...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
                  (ominous)
            I know who you are.
The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.

                        CLEAR
            They said he hung himself, but 
		there's no marks.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            I crafted a reconstruction of the 
		Laryngeal prominence region with 
		Velvetone Surgical Wax and 
		Permaseal.

Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck.

                        ALEX
            What are all those tiny marks?

ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK

The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.)
            Cuticle lacerations.
				
WIDER

                        ALEX
            Why would he pull at the wire if he 
		were committing suicide?
				
                         CLEAR
            Why would they say it was a
            suicide... if it weren't?

Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.

                        ALEX
            His father's pretty fucked up with 
		denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with 
		the thought of an other accident... 
		taking another son.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            In Death...

CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            ... there are no accidents. No
            coincidencess. No mishaps.
                  (smiles)
            And no... escapes.

                        ALEX
            You saying Tod did kill himself?

Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What 
		does it matter? He was going to end 
		someday. From the minute you're cut 
		loose from the womb... it's a one 
		way ticket on a trip to the tomb.

Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You may not realize it, but we're
            all just a mouse that a cat has by
            its tail. Every single move we 
		make, from the mundane to the 
		monumental... the red light we stop 
		at, or run; the people we have sex 
		with, or won't with us; the airplane 
		we ride, or walk out of... is all a 
		part of Death's sadistic design
            leading to the grave.

                        ALEX
            Design?

The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            If Life is like a box of 
		chocolates... Death... Death is like 
		a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse
		Trap." The day you're born is just 
		the boot, hanging from the 
		streetlamp, kicking the marble to 
		get things rolling. Growing up is 
		only the marble rolling down the 
		curving chute. You feel immortal 
		having survived school, sex, drugs 
		'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really
            only upset the big hand holding the 
		steel ball that falls into the 
		bathtub. Marriage and kids and 
		career seem to make it all worthwhile 
		until the ball hits the see-saw and 
		flips the diving man into the big 
		barrel. In the old folks home or the
            hospital you just see the big cage 
		rattling down until it captures... 
		the mouse.
                 (beat)
            Game over.

Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...

                        ALEX
            Maybe there's no way to win... 
		but... if you figured out the 
		game... you knew where the "steel 
		ball was rolling" couldn't you 
		avoid the trap and extend the 
		playing time? Couldn't you... cheat 
		Death at Its own game?

Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH, 
INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            You already did that by walking off
            the plane. Now you gotta out when 
		and how it'll come back at you.
                  (beat)
            Play your hunch, Alex. If you think
            you can get away from it.
                  (beat)
            But beware the risk of cheating the 
		plan, disrespecting the design... 
		could iniciate a horrifying fury that 
		would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
                  (beat)
            And you don't even want to fuck with 
		that Mack Daddie.

Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex.

                        ALEX
            I'm sorry we broke in.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            No harm. No foul.

Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.

                        CLEAR
            We didn't find what we were looking
            for.

Alex looks at Bludworth...

                        ALEX
            Yeah, we did.

MR. BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.

                        MR. BLUDWORTH
            I'll see you soon.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.

                        CLEAR (O.S.)
            The mortician was whacked.

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            He was trippin' on formaldehyde.

Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.

                        ALEX
            He said Death has a design. Even
            before he said that I had been
            seeing patterns.

                        CLEAR
                  (sarcastic)
            As in flannels and plaids?

Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.

                        ALEX
            How many died on Flight 180?
            From our group?

                        CLEAR
            Thirty-nine.

                        ALEX
            Remember the gate number?

As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...

                        CLEAR
            No.

                        ALEX
            Thirty-nine.

This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.

                        ALEX
            Remember the departure time?

                        CLEAR
            Like... 4:25.

Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand is lit.

                        ALEX (V.O.)
            Do you know when I was born?

INTERSECTION

Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.

                         CLEAR
            4:25.

                         ALEX
            Right. April 25th.

                         CLEAR
            Wait. I thought you meant the time
            of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as
            in, month and day... that's a reach.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL

the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.

INTERSECTION

Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.

                        ALEX
            My birthday is the same as of the 
		time I was meant to die! That's a 
		reach!?

VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.

                        CLEAR
            You're sounding like those people
            who, you know... "Oswald shot 
		Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in 
		a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in 
		a theatre and hid in a warehouse."

CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.

EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.

                        ALEX
            I'm not just layin' down a bunch
            of math here, with this. I'm talking
            about indications... omens... that
            day, that we were meant to die. That,
            if, we have been aware of... would 
		have saved everyone on the plane.

                        CLEAR
            That's total bullshit. You can find
            death omens anywhere you want to.

She picks up her paper coffee cup.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a 
		"C" and ends with an "E." So does 
		the word "choke!" We're going to 
		choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was 
		a whaler. We're going to be 
		harpooned!

Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            You'll go nuts if you start with
            that shit.

Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.

He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.

                        CLEAR
            She's leaving the school. Moving 
		away.

Alex studies, appealing to her...

                        ALEX
            Clear, how do we know that by
            just sitting here, breathing this
            air or sipping the coffee, having
            crossed the street... we haven't 
		started in motion the events that 
		will lead to our death? Fifty years 
		from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
                 (beat)
            You don't unless... you're able to 
		open yourself to the signs I'm 
		willing to show you.

He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.

CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND

slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...

... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.

DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST

A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.

CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR

She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.

CARTER'S CAR

CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...

                        CLEAR
            I don't understand... did you see 
		Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?

                        ALEX
            No, but it might as well be the
            same thing. This was a message...
            from someone, or something...
            hinting... at the design.

                        CLEAR
            Alex, on the plane... you must have 
		experienced... some kind of hyper 
		awareness. But here... you're
            suggesting Tod's death... and maybe
            our own... will happen because of...
            an active Presence.

Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.

                        ALEX
            The mortician said Death has a 
		design. Now... if you, me, Tod, 
		Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton 
		messed up that design, because, for 
		whatever reason, I was able to see 
		Death's plan... then we cheated it.
                  (beat)
            But what if it was our time, what if 
		we were not meant to get off that 
		plane? What if it is still is our 
		time? If... It... is still not 
		finished with us? We will all still 
		die; now, not later.

Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            Unless... we find the pattern. And 
		cheat it again.

Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex.

                        CLEAR
            After hearing you, just now... I do 
		believe...
				
Alex leans back and sighs, relieved...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            ...that Tod killed himself.

Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry.

                        ALEX
            Then there's no one left who can help 
		me.

CARTER'S CAR

His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.

BILLY HITCHCOCK

rides his bike. He reacts, startled by...

BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.

WIDER

Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!

Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...

                        TERRY
            Baby, come on... not now.

But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.

ALEX AND CLEAR

Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.

                        TERRY
            Carter...

At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.

                        CARTER
            Kind of have a reunion, here.

                        TERRY
            Let it go!

Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...

                        CARTER
            When are you moving?

                        MS. LEWTON
            A couple of weeks.

She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...

                        CARTER
            We're losing our favorite teacher.

                        ALEX
            Look, there's something you should
            all know.

                        CLEAR
            Alex...

Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.

            CARTER (CONT'D)              ALEX (CONT'D)
Lived here her whole life.        This'll be hard to believe.

Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.

            CARTER (CONT'D)               ALEX (CONT'D)
And now she has to move.          Listen to me, we may all
All because of Browning.          be in danger...

                        TERRY
            Shut up! The both of you!

The two boys stop their heated exchange.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
            They died! We lived!
                   (beat)
            Get over it! I won't let that plane
            crash be the most important thing in 
		my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and 
		if you're gonna waste your life 
		beating the shit out of Alex 
		everytime you see him, then you can 
		just drop fucking dead!

Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND MS. LEWTON

are SPLATTERED with BLOOD before they can even recoil.

                        KEN
            It's that girl... Clear.

No response from Alex. Ken sighs, then into the phone...

            He's in the shower, Clear. Can I 
		have him get back at ya? Sure...

Ken returns to the living room, concerned about his son. Alex averts his eyes, stressed and ashamed. Ken sits nearby.

                        KEN (CONT'D)
            She's concerned about you.
                  (beat)
            I'm concerned about you.

Alex turns his eyes to the glass.

                        KEN (CONT'D)
            Why don't you want to talk to her...
            or me?

                        ALEX

            out, so much. But there's... some
            things I need to understand before
            I can talk... to anyone about it.

The father respects this young man's wishes. Ken nods "fair enough." In the silent moment, O.S., from the television...

                        CNN ANCHOR (O.S.)
            The National Transportation Safety
            Board has a new theory tonight on the

Alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the VOLUME...

            proceeded to the fuel pump.

TELEVISION

The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.

The corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the "hand of Death," seen earlier in the lightning. It is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of Death.

ALEX

is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes...

Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of 
relocating. The house is old, been in the family forever. Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed.

                        MS. LEWTON (CONT'D)
            Everything here reminds me... of

Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows. He checks for any passers-by. Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms. Lewton's car. He visually inspects the exterior. As he kicks the tires... an unmarked sedan SCREECHES up. Doors open...

Startled, Alex turns to find...

Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car.

The curtains billow as if blown by a breeze. Ms. Lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed. As CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, tensing and uneasy...

            Oh... mom's favorite.

She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust.

Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album. CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read...

Some water spills on the side of the kettle. As she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel, a dark shadow appears to cross behind her.

Lewton turns. CAMERA FOLLOWS, CIRCLING as she looks about the room only to find she is alone. Unsetteled, she absently tosses the towel on the counter the edge which, catches a knife blade held in the cutery block.

Ms. Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however... the flames blow out. She pauses, nerves on edge. Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing. She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one.

The agents are taken aback by his answer; unnerved by his sincerity. Weine sighs and looks to his partner, who sighs, frustrated and turns away.

                        WEINE
            Alright, go on. Get outta here.

Alex stands and, with no urgency, moves off. He exits the room.

                        SCHRECK
            Kid gives me the creeps.

                        WEINE
            We got nothing to hold him.

                        SCHRECK
            I don't mean that...
                  (beat)
            There's a couple of times, there...
            I almost believed him.

Weine considers, yet remains skeptical.

                        WEINE
            Sometimes, you give me the creeps.

COFFEE MUG - OVERHEAD

two tea bags are dropped inside, then the steaming hot water.

MS. LEWTON

picks up the cup, raising it toward her lips. She pauses, her expression turning tragic.

On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain. She sits the mug down...

A COFFEE MUG

ENTERS FRAME... displaying the logo of the Mt. Abraham Fighting Colonials.

MS. LEWTON

Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself.

                        MS. LEWTON
            You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's

            You're outta here. Pretty soon...
            you'll be gone.

Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug...

COFFEE MUG

the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as... it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base.

Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.

CAMERA CRANES DOWN to REVEAL the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket. The vodka drip... drip... drips PAST FRAME. Then, Lewton's hand ENTERS and pulls the monitor plug, creating tiny SPARKS at the connection...

the alcohol ignites...

MS. LEWTON

her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor.

the interior catches fire, causing an electrical POP!

MS. LEWTON

turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames.

THE COMPUTER MONITOR

On the screen, the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor... EXPLODES!

MS. LEWTON

a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock.

She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood.

She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes. The needle skips, BUMPS... and settles... umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High."

the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners.

MS. LEWTON

behind her, the stove ERUPTS in FLAMES. They jump, leap like a tiger, landing on her shoulders and hair, which catch on fire...

Alex approaches the front of the house. From here, nothing appears to be wrong. As he catches his breath, sweating, visually examining the house.

From INSIDE, a hoarse, macabre SCREAM! CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX, stunned, before he races off toward the house.

INT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON

DROPS INTO FRAME ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR, hair and sweatshirt aflame. She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames.

On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned. Her open neck wound continues to bleed. Blood pools on the floor. In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up...

LEWTON'S POV - (LOOKING UP) - THE HAND TOWEL

the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.

KITCHEN DOORWAY

Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.

MS. LEWTON

a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.

            They say that he got crazy once and

Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...

THE STOVE

a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.

THE COUNTER TOP

the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter...

MS. LEWTON

the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.

LEWTON'S POV - THE SHADOW

descends, the FRAME COLLAPSING until her face, eerily peaceful, but lifeless gray, horrifically decays... flesh rotting, worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains.

MS. LEWTON

as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her.

ALEX

Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.

                        ALEX
            Ms. Lewton!

Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.

Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.

Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.

            Hey, Alex...

Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house.

THE HOUSE

from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.

ALEX

even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.

Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.

                        WEINE

She studies the men before averting her eyes.

                        CLEAR
            Because I didn't believe him.

The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...

                        SCHRECK
            If he should contact you, it
            would be in the best interest
            of your own safety to contact us.

Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.

Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument.

Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone.

Clear Rivers appears from the shadows.

                        CLEAR
            What are you doing?

                        CARTER
            Terry's name should be on this wall.

Clear is touched by the action.

            So, why'd you want us to meet you
            here? Now?

Carter checks the rearview mirror. Clear looks out the front passenger window. She shakes her head, as if "no one's following us." Billy leans forward from the backseat...

            Um... okay... drive the speed limit,

He sits back, OUT OF FRAME, but quickly darts forward.

            'Cause if you say another word,

Billy sits back, gesturing, "hear ya. Got it." Clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness, her thoughts a million miles away.

CAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic.

The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.

Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.

ALEX'S POV - THE SKY

The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.

                        ALEX (O.S.)
            Are they up there?

WIDER

Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.

            Somehow... is 180 still in flight?
            Somewhere... are they still safe?

Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.
                        CLEAR
            When I was a kid, like, six or 
		seven... I used to worry so much 
		about my parents dying. Like lying 
		awake at night... just worrying. I

		like?
                  (beat)
            Every night... it seemed.

She looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either...

                        ALEX
            Most kids do, I guess.

                        CLEAR
            Most kids never have it happen.

Alex hangs his head...

                        CLEAR
            When I was ten... my dad went into a
            7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard
            somebody say "Don't turn around." So 
		on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was 
		jokin'... he did. And the guy blew 
		his head off.

She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            And, let me tell ya, I had every 
		reason to worry before... because 
		life became shit. I don't blame her, 
		I guess, but my mom couldn't deal 
		with it at all. She married this 
		asshole, who my mom with my real 
		dad would cross the street to avoid 
		this guy. He really didn't want a 
		kid. And so my mom didn't either 
		anymore, I guess.
                  (beat)
            If that was the design for my 
		father... and my family... then fuck 
		Death, FUCK IT!

The waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            And so, anyway... I've thought of 
		that "somewhere," Alex. It exists, 
		that place.

He looks at her.

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            Where my dad is still safe. Where he 
		had a full pack of cigerettes and 
		kept driving. A place where me and 
		my dad and my mom... are still 
		together....and have no idea about
            this second life, here.
                  (beat)
            A place where our friends are still
		in the sky... where everyone gets a 
		second chance.

She looks at him...

                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
            But that place might only exist in 
		my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I 
		haven't experienced too many second 
		chances in my life. I haven't seen 
		any. But because of all of this, I 
		believe... because of you... I will 
		get a second chance. Because of me, 
		you will. With you in my life... that 
		place, right now existing in our 
		hearts, will spring out... and become 
		a real part of this life.

Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.

                        CLEAR
            And that is the only way we can beat 
		Death... by making something special 
		out of Life.

His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...

They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.

                        ALEX
            This won't be safe.

Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.

                        CLEAR
      	Those guys are probably fifteen 
		minutes away.

                        ALEX
            No.. I mean, I don't have anything 
		on me. This won't be safe.

                        CLEAR
                  (sadly)
            Nothing is... anymore.

Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.

             Keep off the highways, they'll be

Carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...

                        CARTER
            Alright, Browning, you fuckin'

Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question...

                  (quietly)
            Yeah.
                  (almost to himself)
            When she died... at that moment, I
            could tell she saw something... horrible.

The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...

                        CARTER
            Out of us... who's next to see it?

Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.

                        BILLY
            Please tell me I'm gonna get to see
            the Jets win the Super Bowl.

                        CARTER
            Me, right? That's why you're not 
		saying.

Billy looks out the window, despondent.

                         BILLY
            Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool,
            that time...

                         CARTER
                  (to Billy)
            Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm
            next.

                        CLEAR
            He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.

                        CARTER
            You have a responsibility to tell me.

                        ALEX
            Is knowing going to make it easier? 
		It makes it harder.

                        CARTER
            You get off havin' control over me.
            Let me choose how to deal with it.

                        ALEX
            It doesn't matter who's next...
            we're all on the same list.

The three are silent.

                        CARTER
            Aww, fuck... really?

Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado.

                        CARTER
            Then why bother? What's the fuckin'
            point? Terry and me will be back
            together on the other side, so why
            wait any longer?

Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...

EXT. AN INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The muscle car ROARS past a stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

The interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection. Alex, Clear, and Billy tenses...

                        CLEAR
            Knock it off!

                        CARTER
            May as well go out under my own
            free will, right?

                        CLEAR
            Not with us in the fuckin' car!

EXT. ANOTHER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The car GUNS IT through another stop sign.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Every passenger hangs on as the car BOUNCES from the next dip.

              CLEAR                    BILLY
          Stop it!                Hey, c'mon, man...

                        CARTER
            What's your fuckin' worry? If it's 
		not your time...? I could get nailed
		runnin' this red light and you all
            wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?

              ALEX                           CLEAR
         No!                           Knock it off!

EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

                        BILLY
            And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!

             ALEX                            CLEAR
       Carter, stop it, you          Get control of yourself!
       fuckin' maniac!!

                        CARTER
            That's what I'm doin'!

                        CLEAR
            I know what you're doing! It's 
		alright to be scared, Carter. You 
		don't have to prove to us how big 
		your balls are. Not now.

                        CARTER
            I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S 
		TIME! I control my life! I control 
		my death!

                        BILLY
            Watch it! Watch it!

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection.

TURNING CAR DRIVER'S POV - CARTER'S CAR

flying down the road, appears to be heading straight towards him.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster...

EXT. A SECOND TRAFFIC LIGHT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands.

                  CLEAR                   ALEX
            Stop the car!              Let us out!

                        BILLY
            I am... so close to puking, you
            don't wanna know.

                        CLEAR
            We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're 
		not going to quit. Maybe you are. You
		act like you're not, but you are!

Carter eyes Clear in the rearview mirror.

                        CLEAR
            So, stop what you're doing and STOP
            THIS CAR! Right fucking now!

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.

OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW

The front crossing arm drops INTO FRAME before the car. Carter turns and flashes a "that's why I stopped" smile.

INSIDE THE CAR

                        CLEAR
            Move it!

Carter turns off the engine, then sits back into his seat and folds his arms, indicating he has no intention of moving.

                        ALEX
            Billy, get out!

Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle. From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left...

OUT OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW - BILLY'S POV

A locomotive headlight arcs across the trees... approaching.

RETURN

                 CLEAR                          ALEX
        Can't you open the door?!      Easy, Billy, just open it.

Billy collects himself...

CLOSE - BILLY'S DOOR HANDLE

POPS open!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train appears around the blind bend...

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Billy opens the door and pours out. Clear and Alex are quickly behind him. Carter remains in the drivers seat.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

The train WARNING WHISTLE BLOWS as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks. They quickly turn around, desperate to convince...

                        CLEAR
                  Carter, get out!

           ALEX                         BILLY
    Don't do it! Don't do it!      It's coming! It's coming!

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...

                        CARTER
            It ain't my time.

He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over... only to be met with the DULL CLACK of a dead engine.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO HIM AS his EYES FLARE with tension...

CLOSE - IGNITION

he turns it, again and again... nothing.

CARTER

looks up...

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT - CARTER'S POV - THE TRAIN

is moments away.

ALEX, CLEAR AND BILLY

assess the situation...

                     ALEX                         CLEAR
     Get out! Get out of the car!        Get out! Get out of the
     Get out of the fuckin' car!         car!

INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror...

CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR

the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness.

CARTER

as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.

He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.

                        CARTER
            I can't get out!

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

Alex, Billy and Clear look at one another, equally frightened...

                        BILLY
            Man, he really is next.

Alex takes off toward...

CARTER'S CAR

Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.

THE TRAIN

the WHISTLES SCREAMS!

CLEAR AND BILLY

tense, as the train nears...

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window.

CLOSE - CARTER'S SEAT BELT

the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes... the seat belt begins to TEAR.

ALEX AND CARTER

As CAMERA SWEEPS IN to ALEX and he releases a deep GROAN...

ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train TEARS THROUGH the front end of the muscular car! GLASS and METAL ERUPT as the locomotive THUNDERS THROUGH FRAME.

CLEAR AND BILLY

must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass.

ALEX AND CARTER

Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage. The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to ROAR PAST...

TRAIN TRACKS

as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.

CLEAR AND BILLY

run to the two survivors.

CLEAR

runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.

ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND BILLY

Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears.

                        CLEAR
            Scared now?

Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt.

                        CARTER
            It broke!
		
                        BILLY
            No one's that strong.

                        CLEAR
                  (to Carter)
            Bullshit. He saved your life...again!

CLOSE - TRAIN WHEELS

continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal...

RETURN

The THUNDERING TRAIN intensifies the situation...

                        BILLY
            THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE 
		NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM 
		YOU!

Billy begins backing away from the others.

                        CARTER
            SHUT UP, BILLY!

                        CLEAR
            WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!

Billy continues backing away, horrified.

                        BILLY
            I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM 
		HIM! HE'S NEXT!

CLOSE - TRAIN TRACKS

the debris rattles beneath the wheels...

CARTER AND ALEX

still on the ground...

                        CARTER
            FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!

BILLY

backing away...

                        BILLY
            YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE 
		DEAD!

TRAIN TRACKS

the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...

BILLY

                        BILLY (CONT'D)
            AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!

FWOOP! The metal tears ACROSS FRAME, ripping Billy's head from his 
shoulders.

ALEX, CLEAR AND CARTER

The ROAR of the TRAIN seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock.

EXTREMELY WIDE - ACROSS THE TRACKS

The train CLEARS FRAME and is gone... REVEALING, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.

                        CARTER
            Jesus fucking Christ!

For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.

                        ALEX
                  (to Carter)
            You should have been next. After
            Lewton, you should've been next. 
		That's the only pattern. You should 
		be dead.

                        CARTER
            You're the fuckin' devil.

                        ALEX
                  (to Clear)
            But I saved him. I intervened. Just 
		like the plane. That's the design.

                        CLEAR
            Police are coming.

                        ALEX
            That's why It skipped Carter and
            went to the next one in the path
            of the explosion; Billy.

Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
            My intervention in the death of 180
            surviviors will cheat the design.

                         CARTER
            "Intervention?" What are you, God
             now?!

                          ALEX
            Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to
            die! Gods don't die! We do!

                          CLEAR
            You're losin' it. The police will be
            here. We have to go to the cabin.
            You can hide there. Get your head 
		together.

Alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...

                        ALEX
            After Billy... it's me. And then you.

Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.

                        ALEX (CONT'D)
                  (to Clear)
            Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.

Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...

                        CARTER
            Then, get out of here.

As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.

In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.

                                                    CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...

INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE

A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.

CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.

ALEX

finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.

Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.

He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.

Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

                                                      CUT TO:

A pink circle fills THE ENTIRE FRAME.

EXTREMELY CLOSE - CLEAR'S EYES

look downward, anxious and full of thought.

A HOME PREGNANCY TEST

the results are positive, two pink dots, confirming.

WIDER

Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests. You can never be too sure. Outside, WIND of an approaching storm blows. CAMERA tensely INCHES IN ON Clear...

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CRACK BENEATH DOOR

The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.

CAMERA RISES TO ALEX, sitting in his safe chair. Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around...

ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG

the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.

ALEX

tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.

ALEX'S POV - CAN

rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.

FISHING HOOK

falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.

ALEX

is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...

THE DOOR

Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.

Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.

CLOSET FLOOR

a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

                        ALEX
                  (as if to Death)
            Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.
                  (defiant)
            I overlooked it. You tried to
            capitalize. But I caught you,
            you fuck. I can beat you. Not
            forever, but I got this cabin
            rigged to beat you NOW!

O.S., a sound. Like a THUMP near the cabin steps. He freezes, like an animal sensing danger. THUNDER RUMBLES. The light around him begins to flicker and sway.

COLEMAN LANTERN

a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.

INT. BEDROOM - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - DAY

Distant... APPROACHING THUNDER RUMBLES as she steps away. The weight of the world on her shoulders, Clear paces, considering her options. She looks to a bookshelf...

CLOSE - AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH

A man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera. Both appear happy and alive. They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods.

The photograph is turned over. On the back is marked in a young girl's handwriting, "me and dad at the cabin. 1986."

CLEAR

As CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER... considering life. Then, now and what is to come.

Weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars. Schreck is behind the wheel.

                        WEINE
            She was up there a minute ago...

A figure steps into the drivers side window, from the rear. The two agents are startled as Clear Rivers leans into FRAME. She pauses, gauging their trustworthiness, then...

                        CLEAR
            I'm not turning him in. There's
            another life that needs him now.

The two agents remain respectful...

                        CLEAR
            I go with you.

                        WEINE
            You can't.

She considers... and understands.

                        CLEAR
            Don't hurt him.

                        WEINE
            Tell us where he is. Wait at home, 
		and I promise... we'll bring him 
		back safe, in protective custody.

As she senses the agents' sincerity...

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.

A headline catches his attention. CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM, tense, while THUNDER RUMBLES. As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked... anxious... he cocks his head to consider... recalling... as CAMERA PUSHES ALL THE WAY INTO...

HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER

"PARENTS TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS." Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer.

ALEX

his expression reflects a terrifying revelation...

                        ALEX
            I... never moved. Christa asked
            me to move, but I didn't change
            seats. I would've moved up...
            next to Tod... How could I not
            remember... that... I never
            moved. Clear's seat was in front

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear paces in her living room. She moves to the curtains and checks out the window. Although it is not raining, LIGHTNING CRACKS across the sky!

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - POWER LINE

The lightning STRIKES the top of the pole, SNAPPING two power lines, which whip in the wind.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power goes out. The room turns dark. Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights CRACKLE. Clear moves to the window.

EXT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV - POWER LINES

ARC violently striking the ground and each other. Each line whips 
unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full. And yet, there's a mean, angry and taunting personality to the two power lines. As if Death were within them.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle. Outside, BLUE ARC LIGHT CRACKLES. She looks out the backyard.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S POV

An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.

The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.

INT. KITCHEN - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog.

Although no window is open, and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning... the candle flame whips, then extinguishes. The blue smoke swirls ominously into the room.

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOTHESLINE

Sharp metal edges spin. Glinting blue arc light...

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps. O.S., SEVERAL CARS APPROACH, headlights pan across the trees. Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the F.B.I umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s THUNDER up to the cabin, siren lights swirling.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles. Schreck points out the passenger window.

                        SCHRECK
            There!

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - WEINE'S POV - THROUGH CAR WINDOW

Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.

WIDER

the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.

                                                      CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The backdoor opens. Clear charges out into the backyard.

THE DOG

Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.

CLEAR

continues to run...

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHESLINE

is whipped by a power line. SPARKS FLY as the base pole snaps in two.

CLEAR

the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.

THE CIRCULAR CLOTHES-LINE FRAME

is rolled by the winds, across the yard toward...

ABOVE GROUND POOL

the clothesline frame punctures the pool. Water streams from the rupture.

CLEAR

reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.

THE POWER LINES

whipping, strike one another causing an angry FLASH!

THE RIVETS

holding the pool frame begin to BREAK and POP. Water floods into the yard.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him... in pursuit.

Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope...

GULLY

He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base...

ALEX

stops with a CRUNCHING THUD... his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CLEAR'S FEET

water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet. She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes. Clear whips up, checking the position of...

A POWER LINE

coils, like a cobra, ready to STRIKE!

TREE

Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.

                        CLEAR
            Run!

The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps...

THE POWER LINE

whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water...

CLEAR

in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back...

CLEAR'S POV - THE DOG

convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - SMALL CREEK

Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep. Alex's foot splashes in the water. THUNDER RUMBLES.

ALEX

races along the path of the stream.

SHERIFFS

continue their pursuit through the dark trees.

ABOVE

Lightning CRACKS a tree branch.  SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.

ALEX

The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned... face down in the creek.

CAMERA MOVES IN... his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles... battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water.

As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.

WIENE'S POV - FOREST

the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies. From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight.

ALEX

struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting...

WEINE AND SHERIFFS

believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVERS'S HOUSE NIGHT

Clear pulls herself up to a tree branch. Lighting and THUNDER CONTINUE amongst the ARCING, CRACKLING POWER LINES. She searches for an escape.

CLEAR'S POV - THE TREE BRANCH

extends toward the house.

CLEAR

straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch...

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - CLOSE - ALEX'S EYES

dart open. Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream.

With a DEEP GASP, he does so. Drinking up the air. It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch.

He pauses only for a couple gulps of air... and is off.

                                                         CUT TO:

EXT. WINDOW - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house. With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, ARCING, at her feet.

                                                        CUT TO:

            Lost him.

The power lines strike the rooftop.

INT. CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear River's stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light. Her television screen BLOWS OUT. Sparks jet across the room. Blasts of FLAME erupt from the electrical outlets. She quickly turns, racing toward the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA IS LOW, RACING WITH HER as SPARKS EXPLODE FROM the lamps and electrical outlets. She cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase...

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS/BACKYARD - NIGHT

Alex tears across the fenceless backyards towards Clear's house. Blue ARC light glowing from the front yard.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A mid-eighties Corolla is parked amongst Clear's artwork. A door, adjacent to the kitchen flies open. Clear hustles through, running to the car and entering via the passenger door, for the sake of expediency.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power lines WHACK angerily against the door.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear scoots into the driver's seat. She CLICKS the automatic garage door opener...

GARAGE DOOR OPENER MOTER

connected to a metal arm, attached to the door, remains motionless - there is no power.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Realizing the motor is dead, Clear takes a beat, STARTS THE ENGINE and SHIFTS INTO REVERSE...

EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex reaches the backyard. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation. HE RUNS OUT OF FRAME...

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Clear guns the small car in reverse.

GARAGE DOOR

as the rear of the car makes impact with the door...

THE GARAGE OPENER

trembles, the long metal arm collapses, falls...

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BAM! In reverse, the Corolla SMASHES through the garage door.

THE METAL ARM
of the garage door opener RIPS through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille. The other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially acting as an anchor.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

The car SHUDDERS, wheels spinning uselessly, as the arm "holds" onto the car.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT - DOOR OPENER MOTER

the screws holding the arm to the ceiling begin to pull away...

A METAL CAN

Foot to the floor, Clear SCREAMS for the car to move.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Corolla lurches backward, freed from the grasp of the house.

INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

a chunk of the ceiling collapses upon Clear's artworks, including the canvas incorporating a jagged piece of debris from Flight 180. The metal SLAMS to the floor, on top of...

THE CAN OF TURPENTINE

which causes the flammable liquid to stream out, toward the driveway.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

As the Corolla lurches away from the house down the sloped driveway...

THE POWER LINE

THUDS upon Clear's car.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

An ear splitting CRACKLE. SPARKS FLY! The electrical system of the samll car erupts and the engine dies. The car stops.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

From the rear of the house appears Alex. CAMERA SWEEPS IN ON HIM as he reacts to the situation...

                        ALEX
            Don't move!

WIDER

The power line sadistically rests atop the automobile. The exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cat's tail, SPARKING, CRACKLING, as it hits the ground.

INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear looks up desperately to Alex.

EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex extends his hands. O.S., CARS approach THUNDEROULSY...

                        ALEX
            You're grounded in the car. Don't
            touch anything. DON'T MOVE.

IN THE STREET

The unmarked F.B.I. vehicle and two sheriff patrol cars pull up on the street. Schreck and Weine hustle out of the car.

                        WEINE
            Alex, get away from there!

                        SCHRECK
            Any part of that line touches you,
            you're dead.

THE POWER LINE

SNAPS in ALEX'S DIRECTION.

ALEX

lurches back...

THE STREAM OF TURPINTINE

is ignited by a single spark fom the power line. It flows toward the car.

ALEX

backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.

CLEAR

keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME...

ALEX

reacts, shocked. He realizes...

WIDER

the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

step forward...

THE POWER LINE

atop the car, whips, ARCS, warning everyone away.

IN THE COROLLA

Clear can see the flames, her instinct is to grab the handle to get out.

CLEAR'S POV - GARAGE WALL

The fire roars angrily in the f.g., on the garage wall, however, the shadows do not match that of the flames, rather, the approaching form of Death appears.

ALEX

steps closer...

                        ALEX
                  NO!

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car...

SCHRECK AND WEINE

                        WEINE
            Get back! You'll both die!

ALEX AND CLEAR

hearing this, Alex's mind is made up. He looks to Clear.

                        ALEX
            You know what to do.

                        CLEAR
            No! No! Don't!

                        ALEX
            When I do this.. it'll have skipped 
		you... and it'll all be over.

At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared...

                        ALEX
            You know what to do. I'll always be 
		with you.

He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.

COROLLA

Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.

ALEX

is engulfed in the flames.

ALEX'S POV - THE SHADOWS

the edges of the FRAME are collapsing. Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay...

ALEX

through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image...

                        ALEX
            NO!

He looks toward...

CLEAR - ALEX'S POV

She... is the last sight he'll ever see.

WIDER

The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway.

CLEAR

Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car.

                        SCHRECK
            Is he alive?

CLEAR'S EYES

flash open, horrified, answering the question...

THE SKY

a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation.

SCHRECK AND WEINE

CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right.

CLEAR - OVERHEAD

As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl. CAMERA MOVES DOWN TO HER FACE, her eyes opened... welling with tears... seeming to realize... to sense, he is gone.

                        DOCTOR
            He's here. A beautiful boy.

CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA

smile and fight back the tears. Clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears.

                        CLEAR
            I felt him! When the baby was
            born... I felt Alex pass through me...

Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor...

CLEAR'S POV - THE BABY

covered in goop, eyes shut... a new life arrives.

Barabra places a cool wet cloth on Clear's forehead...

                        BARBARA
            Exactly a year... to the minute.

Everyone recognizes the eerie, yet beautiful coincidence. Clear leans her haed back, relieved, euphoric...

                        CLEAR
            We beat it, Alex.

Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...

WRIST BRACLET

"Alexander Chance Browning II."

DELIVERY ROOM

CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.

CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here... and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes.

Clear looks up.

            believed. But how do we know... this
            wasn't the design all along?

Clear holds baby Alex up to the monument, showing her son his father's name. Carter stands, watching. CAMERA WIDENS to REVEAL the entire monument against the deep blue sky. At the base in readable, but understandable lettering... "FLIGHT 180."

CAMERA HOLDS as "Long May You Run" CONTINUES... RETURNING each of us to the awaiting darkness.

Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV.
Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek.


                      KIMBERLY
             I know this is the first time we've
             been apart since. But everything's
             gonna be okay.

                      MR. BURROUGHS
             I know, honey. I just --

Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off.


                      MR. BURROUGHS
             Your mother would have been so
             proud of the way you've handled
             yourself through all of this...

                      KIMBERLY
                    (softly)
             I know, Dad.

                       SHAINA (O.S.)
              Hello, the guys are waiting!

Kimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the
car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo.


                        MR. BURROUGHS
               Buckle up!

Mr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots
an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the
stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face.

EXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAY

ON OLD WOMAN

As she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is
shrill and disturbing.

DRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered
face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.

UP AHEAD

Waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.


                        SHAINA (O.S.)
               Watch it!

Kimberly accidentally KISSES the bumper in front of her while
daydreaming. She calls out to the driver in front:


                         KIMBERLY
               Sorry!   My fault!

Shaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and
FRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his
nose.


                        SHAINA
               Want me to drive?

                        KIMBERLY
               No, I'm good.

Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
Kimberly spins around, startled.

Kimberly stares transfixed at the Old Woman, who stares back with
chilling intensity.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking freak." The Old Woman's
PLASTIC BAG BREAKS, sending oranges rolling down the on- ramp. The Old

Woman breaks eye contact with Kimberly as she rushes to retrieve
them.

The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.

Kimberly pulls the SU V onto the highway, looking in the side view
mirror to see the Old Woman look up at her in SLOW-MO.


                       FRANKIE
              Dano, shouldn't we go back and help
              your mother?

                            DANO
              Blo w me.

CU ON KIMBERLY

As she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic
road sign that flashes "WARNING: CONSTRUCTION NEXT 180 FEET".

NISSAN SUV

Kimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow
mini- bus carrying a high- school football team.

Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's
speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back
left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.

CLOSE.

Kimberly pulls around the mini-bus as rowdy football players tackle
each other, yelling:


                            FOOTBALL PLAYERS
                 Pile up!    Pile up! Pile up!

Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at
earsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and
reach to lower the volume.

Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY
CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.


                          DANO
                 Christ, is this tribute to Princess
                 Di Day or what?

Kimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into
the back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the
window.


                            KIMBERLY

                     (unnerved)
              Jesus, all the crazies are out
              today.

A CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around,
taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint.


                       KIMBERLY
              I told you no drugs in the car!    My
              dad will freak!

Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!


                       DANO
                     (laughs)
              Calm down, Kimmy.   It's not drugs,
              just weed.

                       FRANKIE
              Yeah, you should have specified.

Kimberly turns to Shaina, helpless. Shaina spins around, her eyes
wordlessly tell Dano, I know she's a priss, but put it out.

Then Kimberly's CELL PHONE RINGS. She hits the speaker button.


                       MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)
              Kimberly? It's Dad.

                       KIMBERLY
              Hey, Dad. What's up?

Dano defiantly blows more smoke toward Kimberly, then breaks into an
unexpected coughing fit - looking over to see a HELLS ANGEL laughing
at hi m. The biker's trashy GIRLFRIEND, also laughing, quickly FLASHES
HER TITS at Dano over:


                       MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)
              Your car's leaking either
              transmission or brake fluid. I
              want you to have it checked ASAP at
              a gas station.

                       KIMBERLY
              You got it, Dad. I'll call you if
              I have a problem.

                       MR. BURROUGHS (V.O.)
              I mean it. Take care of it.

                       KIMBERLY
              I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.

Kimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at
a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top
SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump.


                        SHAINA
               Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna
               call like every ten minutes is he?

Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him.
He lowers the joint at once.


                        DANO
                      (hiding bag of weed in
                           pants)
               Shit! There's a cop behind us.
               Pull into the right lane now!

Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding
flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !

A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A
COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway.


                        DANO
               Look first, idiot!

Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly.


                        SHAINA
               Ignore 'em.

ON LOG TRUCK

One end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the
pavement, sparking.

Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls
in behind her.


                        KIMBERLY
               Dano, put that out NOW.

Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It
bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.

INSIDE THE EXPEDITION

KAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and
speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.


                        KAT

             No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I
             won't be able to pitch the
             campaign. Let's get Silverstein to
             come in and...

Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her
windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles.


                      KAT
             What the hell?     No,   not you.

Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out
the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing
her vision.

Kat turns and looks at --

DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead.


                      DANO
             What's the cop doing?      Did he see
             that?

Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation.


                       KAT
              Forget it, I'll call him myself.

Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a
number...

PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE

Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.

INSIDE THE POLICE CAR

Thomas speaks into his radio.


                      THOMAS
             I was supposed to be off today.
             How did I get screwed?

                       DISPATCHER (O.S.)
              No biggie. Drake called in sick.

                      THOMAS
             Copy that.
                    (switches off; annoyed)
             Go on, sleep it off Drake.

Thomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard,
but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash.

The VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and
closer to the edge of the dashboard.

BACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV

Dano nervously looks back.


                       FRANKIE
              Relax, dude.

But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "Check Engine" light
begins flickering.

Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles.


                      KIMBERLY
             This trip better be wor th it.
             What's the guy- girl ratio again?

                      SHAINA
             Get ready to smile, five guys per
             girl.

                       KIMBERLY
              I can live with thaaaa --

Kimberly stops mid-sentence when the WHITE VAN in front of her
suddenly SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES and pulls onto the shoulder for no
reason. Kimberly SCREAMS, swerving around the van just in time to
avoid an accident. Frankie instinctively SHOUTS at the van.


                       FRANKIE
              What's your problem, ya fuckin'
              crack baby?!

INSIDE THE WHITE VAN

ISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van
full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are
marked: In Memory of Flight 180.

She chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.


                      ISABELLA
             ...couldn't Keep your dick in check
             for another month? I knew this
             would happen when I got pregnant.

She pounds the steering wheel, furious.


                       ISABELLA
              What'd the doctor say? I have to
              come in to test for STDs? Goddamn

               you, Jorge.

A CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry
of sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise
and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals
shower the visor of --

EUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed
bugs) around his visor and drops back.

INSIDE NISSAN SUV

Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees
a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing
its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.

It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads,
"DRUNK DRIVING KILLS."

Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter
from the back seat.

Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN
against it.

Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front
of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.

OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS
Kimberly.


                        FRANKIE
               Gas it around these idiots. We do
               have 1200 miles to go, you know.

Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a
SUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically
SMASHING two toy cars together.

Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars
by, startling her.

INSIDE PACER

NORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with
two ten-ounce Naya bottles.


                        NORA
               Tim, will you cut that out? I
               can't even hear myself think.

Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.


                        TIM

              Damn, it really hurts, Mom.

                       NORA
              I know, we'll be there soon.

Tim drops the Naya bottles on the seat. One of them quietly falls to
the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL.

INSIDE NISSAN SUV

Kimberly is still behind the smoke-spewing Chevette. She passes it on
the left. Frankie rolls down his window.


                       FRANKIE
                     (yells to driver)
              Ever hear of the Ozone layer,
              asshole?

INSIDE CHEVETTE

RORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD
case. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he
reflexively taps the brakes.

Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and
nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.

INSIDE NISSAN SUV

She has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running
down along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.

Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull
into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with
logs.

INSIDE THE COP CAR

As Thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches
forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.


                       THOMAS
              Son of a bitch.

INSIDE TRANS AM

Its driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly,
clearly making Frankie jealous.


                       FRANKIE
              A Trans Am. That shit went out
              with New Kids on the Block.

                       DANO

              Yeah. Who does he think he is?
              Knight Rider?

                       FRANKIE
                     (laughs; then)
              Who?

Frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window.


                       DANO
              You know, Hasselhoff before he did
              Baywatch.

Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear
around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him.


                       KIMBERLY
              What's the chance of finding a nice
              mature guy once we get to Daytona?

                       SHAINA
              How does a nice mature fuck sound?

Kimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina.


                       KIMBERLY
              Hey, thanks for talking    me into
              this trip. Ever since     my mom... I
              dunno, I just feel like    I'm
              starting to live again,    you know?

Shaina smiles in understanding.

INSIDE POLICE CRUISER

Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he
tries to soak up the coffee.

Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side
of the truck onto the highway.

One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and
out the back, taking Thomas' head with it.

EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED
to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right
in front of the yellow mini-bus.

The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS
tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides
off the road onto the grass median.

He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING
several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a
MACK TRUCK.

Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch.
Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.

Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas
tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield
where it remains half in/half onto the hood.

KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from
the Chevette.
She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a
huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the
Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly.

Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a
huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but
hits it broadside --

Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the
road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag
dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the
side window.

Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her
mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see

NORA'S PACER

Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen
Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of
Kat's Expedition.

The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a
huge fireball.

EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his
Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.

Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF
FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still
alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to
release the seatbelt.

Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh
the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it
like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.

KIMBERLY'S POV

The semi's grill comes right at her!

CU ON KIMBERLY

She screams and we --

CUT TO:

THE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIER

Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her
surroundings...


                      DANO (O.S.)
             Flight 180. You know, that plane
             crash with those kids from Mount
             Abraham.

The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!"

Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.
Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges --

Which BREAKS, exactly like before, and the Old Woman scurries after
them. The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.


                      FRANKIE
             Dano, shouldn't we stop and help
             your mother?

                      DANO
             Blow me. Yellow means go,
             Kimberly.

Kimberly hyperventilates in the driver's seat. Freaking. A yellow
mini- bus with football players speeds past.


                          KIMBERLY
                 Oh my god, oh my god...

Dano, confused, rolls a joint.


                      SHAINA
             What is it? What are you?

                      KIMBERLY
             There's going to be a huge
             accident! Everyone's gonna die.
             All of us! I saw it!

Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.


                          FRANKIE
                 That's it. My turn to drive.

CLOSE UP - KIMBERLY SCREAMS!

AND WE'RE BACK

THE HIGHWAY ON RAMP

Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her
surroundings.


                      DANO (O.S.)
             Flight 180. Y'know, that plane
             crash with those kids from Mt.
             Abraham?

The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.

The kids ad-lib "Let's go", "Fucking freak."

Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.
Kimberly's eyes lower to the bag of oranges, which breaks, exactly
like before and the Old Woman scurries after them.

The signal turns from red to flashing yellow.


                      FRANKIE
             Dano, shouldn't we stop and help
             your mother?

                         DANO
              Blow me.    Yellow means go, Kimmy.

Kimberly hyperventilates in the driver's seat. Freaking. A yellow
mini- bus with football players speeds by.


                       KIMBERLY
              Oh my God, oh my God...

Dano, confused, rolls a joint.


                      SHAINA
             What is it? What are you?

                      KIMBERLY
             There's going to be a huge
             accident! Everyone's gonna die,
             all of us, I saw it!

Dano hums the Twilight Zone theme.


                       FRANKIE
              That's it. My turn to drive.

HONK! The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly
leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van,
the Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile
up. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial.


                         SHAINA

              Relax, you need to chill the fuck
              out.

                       KIMBERLY
              Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.

                       SHAINA
              For Christ sakes girl, take a
              breath.

                       D.J. (O.S.)
              Taking you into an all request
              weekend with a classic from AC/DC.

The opening guitar riff to HIGHWAY TO HELL blares from the speakers.
Kimberly turns to Shaina with a "believe me know?" look, but Shaina's
nowhere near on the same page.

HONKING behind them.

Kimberly, shaking like a leaf, pulls the SUV forwards, turning it
sideways to block off all traffic.


                       DANO
              What the hell are you doing?

Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously
cruising up the shoulder of the onramp. He shoves a bag of weed,
along with the joint, down his pants.


                       DANO
              Five-O's coming!   Let's fucking
              roll, man!

Officer Thomas Burke stops the car behind them.


                       FRANKIE
              Jesus Christ! Here he comes!
              Move!

                        KIMBERLY
              No!   We'll all die if we do!

The cop turns on his FLASHERS.


                       DANO
              I told you she'd ruin everything!

                       SHAINA
              Shut up, Dano, just stay cool.
                     (to Kimberly)
              He's just stoned.

Officer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side
of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle.

                        THOMAS
               What's going on here?

                        KIMBERLY
                      (incoherent, through
                           tears)
               There's going to be a pile up.
               Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it
               happen. It happened.

Thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, "we don't know her."


                        THOMAS
               Miss, please step out of the
               vehicle.

As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously
eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the
pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her
friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly.


                        ISABELLA
               Excuse me, but is there some way we
               could just drive around? I have a
               delivery.

Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it.


                        ISABELLA
               Hey hon, you got a mysterious
               caller on the answering machine
               from Planned Parenthood. What's
               going on?

As she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and
pulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school
teacher in cool leathers.

INSIDE PACER

NORA watches the SUV, distressed.


                        NORA
               What on Earth are they doing?

                        TIM
                      (picking up two Naya
                           bottles)
               Who am I, David Blane?

Nora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles. Nora
tousles his hair. And doesn't stop.

                      TIM
                    (good-natured laughter)
             Okay, quit it already.

As he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't
quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and
Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead.


                      KIMBERLY
                    (trying to calm herself)
             The radio played the same songs,
             the old lady's bag broke the exact
             same way it did in my premonition.

Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past.
She grabs at Thomas for emphasis.


                      KIMBERLY
             THAT's the truck that's going to
             kill everyone!

                      THOMAS
             Alright miss, calm down. I just
             need this lane open. I need you to
             pull your vehicle onto the
             shoulder!

                      KIMBERLY
             You're not listening to me!   You
             have to do something!

EVAN impatiently yells out the window of his TRANS AM.


                       EVAN
              Arrest this whack-job, wouldja?
              Some of us have lives, y'know.

Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her
eyes.


                      KIMBERLY
             Why won't anyone listen to me?

Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs.


                      THOMAS
             I'm not going to tell you to calm
             down again --

A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's
neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in
horror and collapses against the SUV.

Thomas runs to his patrol car.

The White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and
SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into
her cell phone.


                       ISABELLA
              You couldn't keep your dick in
              check for a month?!

The other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's
happened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke.


                       KAT
              Great, now I'm really gonna be
              late.

Thomas barks into the radio handset --


                       THOMAS
              L.A. 51, I need assistance and
              requesting paramedics for a major
              T.A. At --

INSIDE THE SUV

Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing
cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the
SUV.


                          SHAINA
                 Kimberly, what's going on?

Kimberly moves toward Shaina's window. As she leans her head into
Shaina's window, an ominous BREEZE blows back their hair and we hear
the BLARING HORN of a TRUCK.

And Kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by Thomas!

From nowhere, a SHRIEK of BRAKES as a JACK-KNIFED TRUCK plow s the SUV
across the frame! CRASH! Flying debris misses Kimberly and Thomas by
inches!

Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up
in the wreckage.

EXT. POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

CHAOS. Evan, the driver of the Trans Am, impatiently speaks to
DETECTIVE SUBY, late 40s, professional with an open face that makes
him a great listener.

                      EVAN
             I don't know what you want from me.
             Some crazy chic k blocks the highway
             with her car, said there'd be an
             accident and there was. Big deal.
             Even a broken watch is right twice
             a day...

Officer Thomas Burke passes by, heading into --

INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kat, Eugene, Nora, Tim, and Rory sit in a large room, waiting to give
statements. Unlike Evan, these witnesses are clearly distraught.


                      KAT
             Not to sound insensitive, but how
             much longer is this going to take?

                      EUGENE
             If I don't get back to my classroom
             soon, the kids'll tear the room
             apart.

                      NORA
             Those poor people. To think it
             would've been us if not for...

PAN OVER TO REVEAL KIMBERLY. She's still in shock, her mind far away.
Thomas sits close to her, speaking softly.


                      THOMAS
             Tell me again how it started.

                      KIMBERLY
             Like I said, it was like I was
             there. I remember everything. The
             sounds of the crashes, the smells,
             the look on Shaina's face...

                      THOMAS
             Do you remember what triggered it
             all?

                      KIMBERLY
             The log truck...and everybody I
             guess. Everyone was driving like a
             maniac. And somehow I knew
             something horrible was going to
             happen, even before it did.

Something clicks for Thomas, but he forces himself to speak calmly,
like a lawyer leading a friendly witness.


                      THOMAS
             You knew? You just mean a hunch,
             right? A bad vibe, maybe?

The other drivers stare at Kimberly.


                       KIMBERLY
              More than that. All the songs on
              the radio were about car crashes.
              Some kid's banging toy cars
              together.
                  (lookin g at her)
              She was dialing her cell phone with
              her headset on.
                  (points to Rory)
              His car was leaking oil all over
              the road.

                       RORY
              Hey, don't be knockin' the
              Chevette.

But the others listen intently now. Especially Kat, who spies her
headset buried deep in her purse.


                       KIMBERLY
              Billboards about accidents. Kids
              yelling "pile up" for no reason.
              It all felt...just wrong.
              Just like...
                  (swallows; hesitates)

                       THOMAS
              Like what?

Kimberly sighs and looks down. The room becomes eerily silent, except
for the FLICKER of a florescent light.


                       KIMBERLY
              I know this sounds crazy...but you
              all heard about Flight 180, right?
              The kid who got off the plane?

Thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling CRASH as Rory, le aning back in
his chair, tips over. Thomas rolls his eyes as Rory grins sheepishly
and picks himself up.


                       THOMAS
              You mean Alex Browning.

                       KIMBERLY
                  (looking down)
              ...My Premonition was just like
              his.

                       NORA
              What are you talking about?

                       EUGENE
                  (sarcastic)

              Oh, you must have read about that
              kid who had a dream about a plane
              crash so he got his buddies off the
              plane? Then the thing blew up just
              like in the dream?

                         NORA
              Maybe...

Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire
tones.


                       EUGENE
              But this is where it starts to get
              freaky. So a month goes by,
              everything seems cool, but then the
              survivors start dying one boy one.
              'Cause when your number's up, it's
              up, right? Some people said Death
              itself started coming for them,
              hunting down every last one, until
              they were all dead.

Everyone tenses up.


                       THOMAS
              Well, not quite all of them. Clear
              Rivers checked herself into a
              padded room at Stoneybrook.

Kimberly, affected, looks to Thomas for confirmation.


                       KIMBERLY
              You do believe me, don't you?

BANG! Everyone jumps as Detective Suby pounds on the door and opens
it.


                       DETECTIVE SUBY
              Officer Burke? Could I see you in
              here?

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The DOOR OPENS. Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas. Through a two -
way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously.


                       DETECTIVE SUBY
              Tell me you didn't start up on that
              Flight 180 shit again.
                  (beat)
              Did you?

                         THOMAS

              Of course not. That would be
              irresponsible and unprofessional.

Detective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable.


                       THOMAS
              Look, you weren't there. It was
              weird. She knew that log truck was
              gonna cause an accident, she knew.
                  (beat)
              Never mind.

                       DETECTIVE SUBY
              I thought we we re finished with
              this bullshit. This is police
              work, not the psychic Hot Line.

But Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When
Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens.


                       KIMBER LY
              But if I was never meant to pull
              over, then we all should have died
              in the pile up.

                       TIM
              Which means Death could be coming
              for us.

Detective Suby looks pissed o ff.


                       DETECTIVE SUBY
              Way to console the witnesses Burke.

At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket
and wave goodbye to the others.


                       DETECTIVE SUBY
              You got 'em thinking Death is after
              them? Shit, they're the luckiest
              sons o' bitches on the planet. Get
              this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday
              the kid wins the lotto and today
              some looney bitch b locks traffic
              and he avoids the worst pile up in
              years. I should be so damn
              unlucky.

INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what
they've heard.


                       KAT

               What if it's true? What if it's
               happening all over again?

The fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed,
stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm.


                        NORA
               You're all certifiable, you know
               that? I can't believe I've been
               listening to this crap. Come on,
               Tim, let's go outside.

                        TIM
               Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.

                        EUGENE
               Look lady, we're just yankin' your
               chain.

                        RORY
               Yeah, you're acting like we all
               just got the Diff'rent Strokes
               curse or something.

Eugene and Rory burst out laughin g. Nora shakes her head, disgusted.


                        NORA
               What's wrong with you people?

Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door,
the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to
calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence.
Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside.
Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears.


                        MR. BURROUGHS
               Kimberly...

The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam
burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest,
sobbing.


                        MR. BURROUGHS
               Can I take her home?

Thomas nods.


                        DETECTIVE SUBY
               Sure, you can all go.

By now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat
and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless.

                      KAT
             First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now
             this nonsense.

                      RORY
             Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya,
             but I've been over this X-Files
             shit since the sixth season.

As Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light POPS. Then
DARKNESS.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Kimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea
before her. Both are shaken.


                      KIMBERLY
             I know it's crazy, but I'm really
             scared for the others. I've got
             this terrible feeling.

                      MR. BURROUGHS
             What feeling?

                      KIMBERLY
             That it's not over yet.

She picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands.


                       MR. BURROUGHS
             Don 't worry. Everything will be
             fine, you'll see.

INT. EVAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY

A dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell. Evan
appears in the darkness, carrying a brand new television with some
packages on top. He's unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he
climbs.

The stairs are littered with Chinese take out MENUS and a TONKA TRUCK
apparently left by some kids.

As Evan slowly climbs the staircase, a FAT MAN comes down, forcing
Evan to lean against -

THE RAILING - which CREAKS and BENDS. After the FAT MAN passes, Evan
slowly continues up again, TEARING HIS SHIRT on a nail.


                      EVAN
             Motherfucker.

A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward
the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just
misses it!

He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -

The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and
he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself
and continues down the hallway.

INT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Dim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small
packages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.

Evan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it,
who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing
his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to
the fridge and grabs a drink.

In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a
grease-filled frying pan.

Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the
sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --

And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide
forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.

Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the
frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts
the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.

He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter
next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out
HEY E.

PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -
the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the
microwave and turns it on.

ANGLE ON STOVE

The cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his
answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his
packages...


                       VOICE (O.S.)
              Dude! You suck! You buy one
              fucking ticket in your whole life
              and win twenty grand? We're going
              whoring in Prague, you know this!
                     (whisper)
              Hold on, the boss is coming.

A CLICK, then hold MUZAK: AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.

ANGLE ON MAGNET in Chinese fo od. SPARKING. It pops and fizzles. And
ugly sound.

As many similar messages continue, Evan unwraps a new ROLEX! He
slides it over his wrist, admiring it.

ANGLE ON KNIFE

Lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about
an inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.

By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond
encrusted horseshoe ring.

He carries the ring into the kitchenette, sees the Chinese food is
FLAMING, and his hands flash out to turn it off -- A SMALL EXPLOSION
from the microwave startles him.

The RING falls into his drain/garbage disposal!


                         EVAN
              Damn it!

Evan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When
he tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.

Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the
GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.

Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil
from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.

Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE
slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He
continues yanking... Stuck.

He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His
fingers reach for it.

Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to
knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.

The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.

Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the
Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it
threatens to turn on one of the switches.

ANGLE ON FINGERS

In the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on.
And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch.


                         EVAN

              Come on, come on...

Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the
SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!

Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against
the knife in the toaster.

When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out,
knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.

The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the
door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke.


                       EVAN
              Jesus Christ!

Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He
begins COUGHING in the smoke.

Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the
kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire
escape.

He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears
a creak and looks up just as --

A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan
jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire
completely engulfs the kitchen.

He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.
He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.

A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick
shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest
level, intact.

He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges
once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing
and gently drops to the ground.

Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --

SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his
legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.

The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming
right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!

As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly
PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!

INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's
watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning.

Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas
scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180
"survivors".

Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?" "Bizarre Coincidence?" describing
the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the
word, "PREMONITION" --

SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him.

Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder,
humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to
his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest.


                      DETECTIVE SUBY
                    (as if entranced)
             Ooooh, I see it now. Your
             future... A transfer to another
             department.

Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas,
embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands.


                       THOMAS
              You've made your point.

                      DETECTIVE SUBY
             Good. Cause we just got some new
             info and I don't ne ed you getting
             freaky on me.

                      THOMAS
             What?

                      DETECTIVE SUBY
             Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he
             wasn't as lucky as we thought.

Detective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas
looks stunned.

INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT

Kat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and
crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream.


                      KAT
             No, Mom. Just turn on any station,
             they've been playing it all day.
                    (beat; rolls her eyes)
             Yes, Mother. Channel four will do
             just fine. Here it is, gotta go.

She hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report:

FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage.


                      ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)
             Route 18 was backed up for almost
             nine hours today when a record
             breaking pile up...

INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nora and Tim watch the same report.


                      ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)
             ...killed An estimated 18 people.
             Emergency crews spent hours sifting
             through the wreckage.

INT. EUGENE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch.


                      ANCHOR MAN (V.O.)
             ...hoping To recover any survivors
             from this tragic collision. So
             far, the police are refusing to
             release the names of the victims
             until their families are notified.

INT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Burroughs numbly watches the same report. He doesn't see Kimberly
enter behind him from the kitchen.


                      ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)
             The camera of a highway patrol car
             managed to catch this shocking
             footage --

B/W CAMERA FOOTAGE from Thomas' car shows Thomas tackling Kimberly to
the ground just as a jack -knifed truck plows into the SUV.


                       MR. BURROUGHS
              My Lord...

A GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting
back tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV --
but she stops him.


                        KIMBERLY
              Don't.   I have to see this.

Mr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on.

INT. RORY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist
at the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn
everywhere.


                     RORY
             Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right
             there? That's my fuckin' car right
             there! Oh God, that's dope.

After high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a
freshly chopped line.


                      ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)
             In other news, a freak accident
             took the life of a lotto winner.

Rory looks up to see the DMV photo of Evan. As he takes in the
report, his mood radically shifts. He looks like he's been hit by a
train.

MONTAGE

Of Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the
news very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by
EMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to
grading blue books.

TIM'S BEDROOM - LATER

Tim's eyes are glued to the latest Stephen King novel. Nora peers in.


                      NORA
             Come on, Tim, lights out already.

Tim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book.


                        TIM
             Mom?

                        NORA
             Yeah?

                      TIM
             You think... You think those guys
             were b.s.-ing us today or what?

Nora swallows, trying to seem brave.

                      NORA
             Oh, please. Some people just need
             some serious rewiring, that's all.

But neither of them are convinced.


                      NORA
             Get some sleep.

Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim
opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs
it in.

INT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the
closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business
card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again.


                       NORA
              Officer Burke, please?

INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his
hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch.


                      KIMBERLY
             It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten
             anymore.

Mr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective.


                      MR. BURROUGHS
             I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that
             you're safe.

                       KIMBERLY
              I love you too, Dad.     Goodnight.

But Mr. Burroughs isn't ready to leave. He finishes his drink.


                      MR. BURROUGHS
             You know, after your mother died...

Kimberly tenses, bracing for the worst.


                      MR. BURROUGHS
             There were so many times I didn't
             think I could last another day. I
             can't even tell you some of the

               things I th ought about.

                        KIMBERLY
               I used to have those feelings, too.
               But that's when I'd think of Mom.
               Her strength...and courage. And
               I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to
               be as brave as she was. And the
               bad thoughts would go away.

                        MR. BURROUGHS
                      (choking up)
               I don't know what I'd do if I lost
               you.

Mr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as
he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING
out of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr.
Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there
is none. And he leaves.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and
turns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A
porch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety.

A BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in
bed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the
candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of
a...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again.

Headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling.
Shadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL.

Kimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from
the VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00.

She can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and
flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously
turns on her computer.

EXT. STONEYBROOK HOSPITAL - DAY

Kimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that
surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital.

ANGLE ON

A computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to
"Stoneybrook Hospital".

As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow
her inside.

A SIGN offers a choice between "Emergency/Medica l Care" or
"Psychiatric Treatment Center." Kimberly drives to the mental ward.

INT. MENTAL WARD - DAY

A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of
a long corridor. The Physician consults a clipboard.


                      PHYSICIAN
             ...at the request of the patient,
             you are to relinquish any sharp
             objects such as nail files,
             pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby
             pins, no matches, lighters, belts,
             belt buckles, earrings, chokers,
             shoelaces...

Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and
punches "4514" into the electronic lock. They continue down another
corridor.

Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G.


                      PHYSICIAN
             ...paper clips, watches, food,
             drinks, keys, poisons, pills and
             medications.
                    (looks at Kimberly)
             You have a cell phone on you?

Kimberly nods, hands it over.


                       PHYSICIAN
              Then I think we're all done.

They arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in
another code.


                      KIMBERLY
             Wait. Is she...dangerous or
             something?

                      PHYSICIAN
             No honey, but she expects you are.

                      KIMBERLY
             Jesus, how long are you going to
             keep her locked up this way?

                      PHYSICIAN
             Depends on her, I guess.   She's
             voluntary.

The door hisses open.

INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - CONTINUOUS

REVEAL CLEAR RIVERS

While still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her
former self. Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic
paranoia. Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. Bordering on
savage. Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by
something unseen.


                      KIMBERLY
             Clear Rivers?

Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside
her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of
water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.

Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight
180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as
seen in the opening title montage).

The door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps.


                      CLEAR
             Kimberly Burroughs, eh?    What do
             you want?

                      KIMBERLY
             I thought...I thought you might be
             able to help me.

                      CLEAR
                    (snicker)
             Yeah, how?

                      KIMBERLY
             I had a premonition about the Route
             18 pile up. .. I saved some people.
             And now I think Death is after me.

                      CLEAR
             Nice work. Maybe if you're real
             lucky, you'll wind up in here with
             me.
                    (gives Kimberly the once
                         over)
             But I doubt you'll survive that
             long.

Kimberly flinches.


                      KIMBERLY
             It's not just about me. Someone I
             saved died last night in a freak
             accident. What if the others are
             in danger, too?

                      CLEAR
             Well, if you put them on the list,
             they're already tits up.

                      KIMBERLY
             What list?

                       CLEAR
              Death's list. The precise order
              you're going to die in.

Clear's eyes bore into a terrified Kimberly's.


                      CLEAR
             The survivors of Flight 180 died in
             the exact order they were
             originally meant to die in the
             plane crash. That was Death's
             original design.

                      KIMBERLY
                    (sudden realization)
             Exact order? Then I'm next! I was
             meant to die with my friends, so
             I'm next!

Clear backs away from Kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops
short.


                      CLEAR
             But you said someone else died last
             night. That means Death skipped
             past you. Someone must have
             intervened.
                    (off Kimberly's confusion)
             Sometime yesterday you must have
             nearly died, but someone saved you.

Kimberly nods, recalling the events.


                      KIMBERLY
             Officer Burke pulled me away from
             the crash that killed my friends.

                      CLEAR
             Congratufuckinglations. That makes
             you last to go. But don't worry,
             once the others are dead, it'll
             come back for you. Always does.

                      KIMBERLY
             That still doesn't make sense. You
             said you die in the same order you
             were originally meant to. But Evan
             Shaeffer died last in my
             premonition, not first.

Clear seems very disturbed by that.


                        CLEAR
               It's moving backwards?    Are you
               sure?

Kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...

HARD CUT TO:

THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE PILE UP

Nora's Pacer folds like an accordion, then EXPLODES, followed by Evan
screaming in the Trans Am, which gets CREAMED by the semi!

BACK TO:

Kimberly, shaken, does the math.


                        KIMBERLY
               Yes. In my premonition that Nora
               woman and her kid died first, then
               Evan and then...my friends.

Clear is oblivious when Kimberly breaks into silent sobs.


                        CLEAR
               Backwards...that's new.

Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens.


                        CLEAR
               That's good. Get all your tears
               out now, you'll need your eyes.
                      (off Kimberly's confusion)
               For the signs.

                        KIMBERLY
               Signs?

                        CLEAR
               If you have the same power as Alex,
               you'll be seeing signs soon. When
               you see anything creepy or ominous,
               an in-your- face irony kinda thing?
               Don't ignore it. It usually means
               the difference between life and
               death.

                        KIMBERLY
                      (to herself)
               The songs on the radio.
                      (to Clear)
               But wait. I don't understand.       Why
               is this even happening to me?

                      CLEAR
             That's what Alex used to ask
             himself right up until...

For an instant, we see a gentle side of Clear.


                      KIMBERLY
             It's obvious you know what you're
             talking about. You beat it. You
             have to help us.

Clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift.


                      CLEAR
             I didn't beat it; I hid from it.
             If you were smart you'd put a down
             payment on a burial plot and say
             goodbye to the dog, because what
             little life you have left is over
             as you know it. Don't make new
             friends, don't fall in love, and
             don't ever bother trying to save
             others. That's the worst killer of
             them all.

                      KIMBERLY
             How can you say that?    What kind of
             monster are you?

At once, Clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched
teeth.


                       CLEAR
              My family is dead.   My friends are
              dead. And Alex...

Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly.
While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a
gruesome picture on its own.


                      CLEAR
             And yes, that's the blade of a
             fucking ceiling fan in his head.

Clear pounds on the door, apparently done with Kimberly. A GUARD
opens the door. Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons
her courage and turns back to Clear.


                      KIMBERLY
             Know what? I think you're a
             coward. I think you hide out in
             here because you're too damn bitter
             and selfish to care about another

              living soul. In my opinion, you're
              already dead.

Kimberly leaves, giving Clear something to think about.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

As Kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a STRANGE
CAR parked there. Then --

THOMAS, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the
house. He guiltily backs away as Kimberly gets out.


                       THOMAS
              I tried calling last night but your
              father --

                       KIMBERLY
              Evan Shaeffer's dead.

Thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect
the sky behind them.


                       THOMAS
              I know. I've gotten calls all
              morning from everyone who was on
              the onramp. We're all meeting at
              my apartment tonight.

                       KIMBERLY
              Then you believe all this?? That
              Death is working off a list?

Thomas hesitates before answering.


                       THOMAS
              I didn't. Until I was dispatched
              to clean up one of the Flight 180
              survivors.

                       KIMBERLY
              Clean up? I don't...

Suddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees
hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once!

Like a scene out of THE BIRDS, Kimberly must duck and cover as the
pigeons assault her from every angle.

But when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual
pigeons, THEY'RE GONE. ALL IN HER HEAD.


                       KI MBERLY
              Did you see that??

Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing.


                       KIMBERLY
              Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's
              right about the order, then Nora
              and Tim are going to be attacke d by
              Pigeons!

                       THOMAS
              I'm not following you --

                       KIMBERLY
              They're next on the list.   We have
              to find them.


EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - DAY

ANGLE ON

Woman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her
son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of
the steel side panels, untying it...

                       TIM
                     (mischievous smile)
              You think the tooth fairy's gonna
              come tonight? I'm thinkin' like
              fifteen bucks.

                       NORA
              Nice try, kiddo.

Tim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth.

THE DANGLING SHOELACE heads straight for the escalator grate. IT GETS
SWALLOWED UP. As Tim steps off, Nora TRIPS forward. Her caught
sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase.

                       TIM
              Mom!

Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker,
fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the
shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again.

                       TIM
              You okay?

Nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the
stubby one.

                       NORA
              Sure hon. I'm fine.   Let's shake
              it, we're late.

Tim nods. The wind picks up as they continue past a --

CONSTRUCTION CREW

Who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of PLATED
GLASS .

Tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass JACKHAMMERS, a
CEMENT MIXER, and an EXCAVATOR.

INT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - DAY

Clear Rivers applies fun- tack to the back of a newspaper article and
sticks it on the wall devoted to Flight 180.

REVEAL

A photo of Eva, "Lotto Winner Killed By Ladder".

Clear backs away, pausing to look at a group photo of the Survivors
of Flight 180 just before take off. Smiling faces.

                       TIM
              Not so much.

Dr. Lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself.

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The RECEPTIONIST appears next to the fallen fish food with a VACUUM.
She plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank.

A startling GRIND as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. She
vacuums up the fish food around Nora's feet.

The DEAD FISH gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which
sputters and stops. The water level RISES, spilling water over the
side of the tank. The water TRICKLES closer to the outlet.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Thomas drives his car into a friendly neighborhood. Kimberly, riding
shotgun, hangs up her cell phone.

                       KIMBERLY
              Turn around. The cleaning woman
              said they're at the dentist's.
              14th and Main.

                         THOMAS
              Hold on.

Thomas expertly skids into a U-turn.

INT. DENTIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tim looks petrified as Dr. Lees unveils a tray full of PICS, CARVERS
and EXTRACTING FORCEPS.

The KA-CHUNG of construction outside makes it im possible to
concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, Dr. Lees picks up a pic
and mirror and starts examining Tim's mouth. CU of PIC gently
prodding Tim's teeth.

                      DR. LEES (O.S.)
             I'm a little disappointed, Tim.
             Does your mom know you've been
             smoking?

Tim groans "uh-uh", then suddenly flinches.

                      DR. LEES (O.S.)
             Yeah, that'll have to be filled.

A BANG from the window startles Dr. Lees. His HAND JERKS, but luckily
the pic was removed from Tim's mouth.

Dr. Lees whips around in time to see a PIGEON flutter away from the
window.

                     DR. LEES
             Jesus. Every day at the same damn
             time. Now this'll only sting for a
             moment.

Dr. Lees picks up a large SYRINGE and moves it toward Tim's open
mouth.

                       DR. LEES
              Open big. Wiiiiider...

Tim's eyes radiate fear. The MOUTH OPENS. Reluctantly. Tim nervously
eyes the window as the needle enters...

ANGLE ON

NEEDLE heading toward his gumline --

BANG! Another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. Dr. Lees'
hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue. Tim squirms violently. Dr.
Lees looks towards the window angrily.

                      DR. LEES
             How the hell do they expect me
             to... Would you rather have the
             laughing gas?

Tim nods his head ferociously.

                         DR. LEES
             Jean?     I need you in here.
                       (waits)
             Jean??!

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jean continues vacuuming. The vacuum makes contact with Nora's foot.

INT. DENTIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

After a minute, Dr. Lees angrily switches on two compressors: Oxygen
and Nitrous Oxide.

By now, the NO mask has been attached around Tim's nose. As Tim
drifts off, Dr. Lees lowers a DRILL into his mouth.

                       DR. LEES
              Open big. Wiiiiiider.

Excruciating SOUNDS of the drill going through enamel.

INTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS

Racing to the medical complex throughout.

THE WAITING ROOM

The WATER TRICKLES into the outlet. The vacuum sparks and dies just
as --

BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE

BANG! SFX: BROKEN GLASS - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed
through the window. In the other room.

                       DR. LEES
              Goddamn it already.

Dr. Lees marches out of the room to investigate. Another quick
electrical surge and the OXYGEN COMPRESSOR flutters off. The needle
drops. But the NITROUS flow remains strong.

ANGLE ON FISH MOBILE

Spinning from a new breeze. Suddenly, a small round PUFFER FISH FALLS
directly into Tim's mouth.

Soft, gurgling and choking.

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly
right. Dr. Lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it.

BACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE

SLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but
rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops.

Sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue
our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes.

They GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame
and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth.

REVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to
make sure nobody saw...

EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER

Nora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A
CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back.

From across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas
appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming.

                        TIM
               What are they doing here? And why
               are they yelling "pigeons"?

Just then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who
suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand
inadvertently jerks a lever -

A METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE
SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his
mangled body visible underneath.

As two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER

Emergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks
back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a
stretcher into an ambulance.

                        THOMAS
                      (shaking his head)
               Nora's not coming. She refuses to
               leave her son.

                        KIMBERLY
               We have to tell her she's in
               danger!

                        THOMAS
                      (sadly)
               I did. And right now, I don't
               think she cares.

EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY

Thomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her
hand and watches it tremble.

                        KIMBERLY
               It's happening again.   It's fucking

              happening again. I hoped we'd get
              there and they'd be okay, that
              Clear Rivers was full of shit and
              Evan's death was just a freak
              accident...

Thomas kills the engine to listen.

                       KIMBERLY
              But we're all going to die. We
              can't stop it. It's just a matter
              of time. I'm so scared.

Thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly.

                       THOMAS
              I am too. But you can use that
              fear. It'll sharpen your
              instincts. Keep you alert fro
              signs. It's the only way you'll be
              able to sav e the others...and me.

Kimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses
he's losing her, and softens her approach.

                       THOMAS
              I know you didn't ask for any of
              this, Kimberly. But I don't think
              you have it in you to quit either.

Kimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in.
BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car.

Kimberly jumps, then spins around to see:

CLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful
presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear
stare each other down.

                       KIMBERLY
              Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.

Clear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly.

                       KIMBERLY
                     (bitter)
              The second one just dies.   A 16
              year old kid.

                       CLEAR
                     (nods; a faint trace of
                          guilt)
              I hope you're ready for this.


EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Thomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly,
Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door.

                       KIMBERLY
              This is cheery.

                       THOMAS
              Who is this guy, anyway?

                       CLEAR
              A mortician. He seemed to know a
              hell of a lot more about death than
              he ever told us.

                       THOMAS
              Should we knock?

                        CLEAR
                      (looking ill)
              He probably already knows we're
              coming.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Kimberly, Thomas and Clear open the large wooden doors into a small
chapel, creat ing a loud CREAK. A corpse in an open casket sits at the
front of the chapel, post -wake.

Kimberly, Thomas and Clear are forced to walk around the dead body to
get to a side door.

INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.
An ORANGE GLOW flickers from the far room. The unmistakable sounds of
a furnace make it all the more eerie.

As they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the
shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven.

They edge closer. They peek inside the --

INT. CREMATORIUM

Oddly there is no one there. As they enter, passing the furnace, a
momentary WHOOSH of flames startles them all!

They jump back - bumping right into:

MR. BLUDWORTH, the dark, sinister mortician from FD1, who has
inexplicably appear BEHIND THEM.

                       MORTICIAN
              Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an
              eye out for you.

The mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying EVAN'S EYELESS BODY
toward the firing oven. Kimberly and Thomas are scared.

                       KIMBERLY
              Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.

Clear, however, seems to expect nothing less.

                       MORTICIAN
              Come to... Pick my brain?

The Mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into Evan's
mouth. And YANKS out a gold tooth. Kimberly recoils as he discards
the bloody tooth on a metal tray.

                      MORTICIAN
                    (to Kimberly)
             Flesh and bone require 1,600
             degrees for cremation. Gold,
             prosthetics and other metals must
             be removed before the final --

                       CLEAR
                     (not falling for this
                          again)
             Just a simple question and we'll
             leave you alone with your new
             friend.

The Mortician grins; he likes the new Clear. He crosses the room and
hits a LEVER. KA- CHUNK! The oven begins to blaze.

                      MORTICIAN
             Fire away.

                      CLEAR
             How do you cheat Death once and for
             all?

The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down
to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.

                        MORTICIAN
              Dead.   But still fresh.

Kimberly shudders as the Mortician moves back to Evan's body. Clear
has had about enough.

                      CLEAR
                    (to the Mortician)
             Look, we drove a long way to get
             here. So if you happen to know how
             to get this death monkey off our
             backs, it sure would be swell if
             you told us.

The Mortician now CLAMPS THE PLIERS around Evan's NIPPLE RING.

                       MORTICIAN
              For what purpose? You seek a back
              way out of a room with but one
              door. You can't cheat Death; there

              are no escapes.

                       CLEAR
              Bullshit. You told me Death has a
              distinct design, a blueprint,
              unalterable. But Alex and I
              cheated Death not once, but dozens
              of times. If the design is flawed,
              it can be beaten.

A sick smile crosses the Mortician's lips. He yanks the nipple ring
OFF! Kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when Clear doesn't
flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.

                       MORTICIAN
              Such fire in you now. People are
              always most alive just before they
              die. Don't you think?

Clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.

                       CLEAR
              It can be beaten.   And you know it.

CREEEAAAK -SLAM! The Mortician rolls Evan's body into the oven.

                        MORTICIAN
              Some say that there is a balance to
              everything. An equilibrium that is
              the connective tissue of the
              universe. They say that for every
              lif e there is a death, and for
              every death a life...

His words hang in the air. An ominous BREEZE enters.

                        MORTICIAN
              Solus novus anima licet evinco
              mortis; Only new life can defeat
              death.
                     (off their confusion)
              The list of life is forever set by
              the Divine Plan, the guiding hand
              that plots the course of the
              universe, down to its tiniest
              element s.

Thomas looks to Clear; what's he talking about? The Mortician focuses
on Kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.

                       MORTICIAN
              The list accounts for every life;
              from the dawn of man to the great
              apocalypse. But the introduction
              of life that was not meant to be, a
              soul forbidden to roam the earth,
              that could invalidate Death's list,
              shatter its very existence.

Evan's other eye POPS , startling Thomas and Kimberly.

                       THOMAS
              What the hell does that mean?

                       MORTICIAN
                     (with finality)
              To figure that out you'll have to
              follow the sign s.

The Mortician grabs Kimberly.

                       MORTICIAN
              But be warned. To disrupt the
              grand design is to unravel the
              tapestry of the universe. When you
              pull all the threads apart, you may
              find yourself hanging from them.

The Mortician finally lets Kimberly go.

                       CLEAR
              One last question. Why is Death
              working backwards this time?

The Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex.

                       MORTICIAN
                     (shakes head; a sick
                          smile)
              Sorry, time's up.

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

CLOSE UP - GAS DRIPPING

From the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for
signs of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY
CUT-OFF VALVE

Some SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by
Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out.

                       THOMAS
              New life defeats death? Follow the
              signs? Where the hell did you find
              that guy?

                       KIMBERLY
              Yeah, I thought he was supposed to
              be helpful.

                       CLEAR
              He was. If we can use your ability
              to see the signs, we can cheat
              Death long enough to figure out
              what "new life" means.
                     (off their looks)
              I know, it worries me that I

                understand him.

Thomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground. Quick looks
all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a
match.

CLEAR'S HAND SLAPS the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid -
motion.

                         CLEAR
                What the fuck are you thinking?

The startled Skate Rat shrinks back from Clear's rage.

                         SKATE RAT
                I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee
                yatch.

Thomas chuckles to himself and looks at Kimberly who --

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - DAY

POV DRIVER. Grease-covered female hands reach out toward a steering
wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!

The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In
moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.
Drowning. Horrible.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. GAS STATION - DAY

KIMBERLY

Comes to Thomas' arms - GASPING uncontrollably for breath. Terror-
stricken. She begins hyperventilating.

                         THOMAS
                What is it? What did you see?

It's so bad, Kimberly can't speak. She coughs and gags as if recently
drowned. Clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers.

QUICK CUTS:

A POWER REPAIRMAN

On a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a LAWN BOY pull-
starts a WEED WHACKER close to broken glass, a MECHANIC on a tall
ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female DOG WALKER with
three dogs approaches the ladder.

                         CLEAR

             You have to tell us now.

                        KIMBERLY
             I...I...

Clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an
angry drill sergeant.

                      CLEAR
             You're strong. Do you hear me?
             You're a fucking warrior. Nothing
             scares you. In fact you happen to
             be the single most powerful woman
             on earth. Now what did you see?

The words slowly take affect. Kimberly becomes centered, getting her
breath back, and speaks without a hitch.

                      KIMBERLY
             I was driving a white van. It
             must've gone out of control because
             it crashed into a lake and I
             drowned. It was...horrible.

                      CLEAR
             You were there?

                      KIMBERLY
             I can practically taste the water
             in my throat. And something else.
             The smell of flowers...

                      CLEAR
                    (confused)
             Then it wasn't just a sign. It was
             a premonition?

Thomas gently releases her, paces.

                      THOMAS
             Remember the onramp? There was a
             pregnant woman in a white delivery
             van.

                      CLEAR
             Holy shit. He said "only new life
             can defeat death."
                    (off looks)
             If she gives birth to a baby that
             was never meant to be born, a brand
             new soul that was never part of
             Death's Design...

                      KIMBERLY
             It throws the entire Death list out
             of whack. And a new list has to be
             rewritten f rom scratch. We all
             start over with a clean slate.

                       THOMAS
              It sounds all well and good, but

             what if we're wrong?

                      CLEAR
             Please, what else could it mean?

                       KIMBERLY
                     (to Thomas)
              So if you give us the pregnant
              lady's number, we can warn her
              about the lake and she'll live long
              enough to have the baby.

                       CLEAR
              So let's do it.

                      THOMAS
                    (realization)
             Shit, I don't have her number. She
             was never interviewed. She took
             off right after the accident.

                      KIMBERLY
             How are we going to find her?
             There must be thousands of white
             vans in this state.

                      THOMAS
             Hey, I'm a police officer,
             remember?

INT. A/V ROOM - POLICE STATION - LATER

Thomas works a VCR, scanning BACKWARDS through the video footage from
the patrol car camera. We see the SUV's explosive collision with the
jack- knifed semi. Kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the
crash.

                       KIMBERLY
              Oh God...

Thomas sees Kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor.

                       THOMAS
              I, uh...sorry.

Kimberly notices Clear watching her and toughens up. She forces back
the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away.

                      KIMBERLY
             I know, I know. We need my eyes.

Clear sits beside Kimberly.

                      CLEAR
             It's all right.    I'll take watch.

Kimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's
already buried the need to cry.

                       KIMBERLY
              I'm okay. Just caught me by
              surprise. Put it back on.

Clear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse.

                       CLEAR
              Make sure all these people will be
              at the meeting tonight.

                       THOMAS
              Taken care of.

THE MONITOR

Back, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down
the onramp.

                       KIMBERLY
              There it is.

                        THOMAS
              Got it.

Thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past
the White Van. A clean shot of the license plate. Jackpot.

As Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate
number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame
by frame.

                       CLEAR
              I don't get it. Why is everything
              happening so fast? After Flight
              180. A month went by before anyone
              died. And now five people are dead
              in less than a day.

Thomas' computer screen finally fills with information.

                       THOMAS
              Here we go. The vehicle's a
              delivery van registered to Jorge
              and Isabella Cruz. And Christ,
              there's almost a dozen domestic
              disturbance complaints on these
              two.

                       CLEAR
              We need to hurry.

They all get up and leave.

Ominously, THE MONITOR shows the NEXT VEHICLE creeping behind Nora's
Pacer - a white van!

INT. CRUZ HOUSE - NIGHT

Thomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. Thomas, Kimberly and
Clear get out and start up the unlit path. It's dark, hard to see
where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning
the walkway.

                      THOMAS
             Let's lay this on her gently now.
             The stress alone could upset the
             pregnancy.

Kimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when
AUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage.

All three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate
from within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF.

But nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and
as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and
purposefully to the front door.

He makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a
ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at
the last second by its owner -

JORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's
BARKING:

                       JORGE
             What?

                      THOMAS
             I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for
             an Isabella Cruz.

Suddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog.

                      JORGE
             Shut up!!!

The Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it
lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once
again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer.

Jorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns.

                      THOMAS
             Are you Jorge Cruz?

                        JORGE
              Maybe.   What's this about?

                       THOMAS
              May we come in?

                       JORGE
             No.   What's this about?

ANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile
floor. She takes in what she can see of --

THE ROOM

As if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn.
Furniture over-turned.

                       THOMAS
                     (a little stern)
              It's about your wife, Isabella.
              Now is she here?

Jorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him.

                        JORGE
              No.   I'm alone.

But by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares
through the house, into a bedroom and sees -

A FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead.

                       THOMAS
              Look, pal, it's probably nothing.
              But I need to see --

Jorge is already closing the door.

                       JORGE
              Forget it. You'll need a warrant.
              I know, I'm a lawyer.

Clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past
Jorge's grasp.

                        JORGE
              Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!!

Clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to
the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes
a closer look at Clear.

                       YOUNG WOMAN
              We never meant to hurt you
              Isa...You're not Isabella!

Meanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas.

                       JORGE
              I'm going to sue your ass!

                       KIMBERLY
              Whose blood is that on the floor?

Defensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut.

                        JORGE
               Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts
               this afternoon. Now arrest her!

                        KIMBERLY
               Where's Isabella? Did you finally
               kill her you fucking wife beater?

Jorge flinches. It's time to come clean.

                        JORGE
               We had a fight. Some things got
               broken, the dog went crazy, she
               left me. Wouldn't say where she
               was going.

                        THOMAS
               What was the fight about?

                        JORGE
               Take a guess.

                        THOMAS
               Does she have a cell phone?   A way
               we can contact her?

                          JORGE
               She did.

He eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor.

                        CLEAR
               We're wasting time with this piece
               of shit. Let's just get to the
               meeting.

Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.

                        JORGE
               Hey, when you find her, tell her
               the kid's half mine.

Clear mutters something as they exit the house.

                        CLEAR
               We can only pray it doesn't come
               out retarded.

Jorge hisses something at the Rotty, which CHARGES them and SPRINGS!
But Thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Rory sits in his Chevette outside an apartment building, staring up
at the address. He quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes
his nostrils free of crystals. He takes a breath and exits the car.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Rory follows some PEOPLE into the elevator. The elevator doors close
on his shoe -- trapping Rory in an awkward position.

One MAN frantically pushes the DOORS OPEN button to no avail.
Finally, as the elevator rises, Rory YANKS his foot free.

                        MAN
               Jesus Christ. I wrote to
               management two weeks ago about
               these friggin' bumpers.

Rory bends down and inspects his shoe.

                        RORY
               Damn, is that dogshit?

Rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the Man's face - see? -
before disgustedly slipping it back on.

DING. The doors open. The man hurries out and the elevator DOORS
CLOSE on Rory's smirking face.

HARD CUT TO:

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - LATER

REVEAL - Nora, Rory, and Kat, mortified, sit on a couch. It's obvious
the bomb's been dropped, reality has set in. Clear and Kimberly await
their reactions. Nora raises a trembling hand.

                        NORA
               Does anybody have a Valium?

Kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill.

                        KAT
               You'll want to take --

Nora pops it in her mouth.

                        KAT
               -- half of that.

Nora chews, her eyes half dead from bereavement. Across the loft,
Thomas paces, phone in hand.

                        THOMAS
                      (quietly, into phone)
               Any word yet on the Dodge van?
               Damn.

Eugene alone seems unafraid. He uses a GRABBER - a long pole with
movable claw on the end - to OPEN THE SKYLIGHT. When done, he
balances the long pole precariously against the wall.

An OMINOUS BREEZE enters. Clear notices MAGAZINE PAGES blowing over
the desk by the couch.

                      NORA
             So that would mean... I'm next.

                      EUGENE
             Nobody's next. This is crazy.
             First death's stalking us and now
             premonitions?

                      KAT
             This can't be happening. My
             career's at a peak, I finally met a
             cute guy, I just bought a new
             house...

                      RORY
             Just shut the fuck up and maybe
             you'll live.

Kat's hands ball into fists. The hatred is mutual. Clear reaches for
a nearby cardboard box on the desk, noticing MAGAZINE PAGES blowing
over until their weight tips over a PENCIL HOLDER which spills pens
out. She takes the box to Nora.

                      CLEAR
             You're not next, Nora. Nobody has
             to be next. That's the point.
             Last time, we didn't plan. We
             weren't organized. Now we can help
             each other.

She reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to Nora and the
others.

                      CLEAR
             Think what would have happened if
             Kimberly had been able to warn you
             with the word pigeons...

Nora's head falls. Kimberly senses her anguish and takes over.

                      KIMBERLY
             The point is, as long as you know
             what to beware of, you have a
             fighting chance. It can be beaten.
             If I call you and say subway, get
             to a high rise fast. A place where
             no subway could possibly go, get
             it?

Everyone nods in understanding. Rory fidgets, sniffling, then POUNDS
the table in frustration. Startling Kat.

                      RORY
             Why the hell did I ever get on
             Route 18 in the first place?
             That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.

Clear, very alert, looks at the tipped PENCIL HOLDER. PENS ROLL
toward the end of the desk, toward a large White Pages directory
which hangs precariously off the edge just so.

                       CLEAR
              Anyone read today's paper?   The
              article on Evan Shaeffer?

No one says a word.

                      CLEAR
             The only reason he was on Route 18
             was because he own the lottery and
             had to collect the winnings.

                       RORY
              That lucky bastard.

                      CLEAR
             What about the rest of you?
             Kimberly, you were driving to
             Daytona. Was Route 18 your first
             choice?

                      KIMBERLY
             The new freeway was faster, but
             Route 18 was the way my mom used to
             take, so...

They take turns going around the room.

                      THOMAS
             Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but
             he called in sick so I got...
                    (blanches)
             Drake's never sick.

                       KAT
              I was my first day of jury duty.

                      EUGENE
             Jury duty? That's randomly
             selected by social security
             numbers.

                      CLEAR
             Random, sure.

                      EUGENE
             What, you think Death planned for
             each of us to die in the pile up
             weeks ago? You're nuts.

Clear fumes. Rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet.

                      RORY
             Last July I dialed a wrong number
             and got a radio station by
             accident. They asked me what
             number means "good luck" in Jewish.

                       KAT
              Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".

                       RORY
              Anyway, I guessed it right and won
              these.

Rory holds up two Yankee tickets.

                       RORY
              The best way to get to Yankee
              Stadium is Route 18.

                       KIMBERLY
              I don't know what's weirder, the
              dialing a wrong number part or that
              Death would set you up nine months
              in advance.

                       THOMAS
                     (realization)
              Whoa, nine months?

                       KIMBERLY
              Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

INT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON ISABELLA'S PREGNANT BELLY.

REVEAL she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on
the motel phone. A disturbing metallic SQUEAK SCRAPE -SQUEAK can be
heard, nearly drowning out the SCREAMING COUPLE next door.

                       ISABELLA
              Yes, I'd like to report a domestic
              squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz
              why, does it matter? I'm at the
              Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white
              van. So what? Just get over here.

Isabella hangs up, recoiling at VIOLENT THUMPS against her wall. PULL
BACK AND UP TO REVEAL the source of the unsettling SQUEAK is a
rickety, wobbling CEILING FAN.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kimberly whispers into the phone.

                       KIMBERLY
              I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard
              time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll
              stay here at Virginia's tonight and
              see you tomorrow. I love you too.

She hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. Clear
keeps her eyes on the pens that ROLL on the slightly canted table
into the about-to -fall White Pages directory.

                      CLEAR
             Remember everyone, just because
             Kimberly's got the power doesn't
             mean we're not all capable of
             seeing signs to some extent.

The pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips
over and PLOPS HEAVILY onto a GOOSE-DOWN THROW PILLOW.

Small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze.
Everyone in the room watches them rise.

                      RORY
             It's like Forrest Gump.

They float across the room, ultimately landing on a MOUSETRAP! SNAP!
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber
- which tips and slowly slides down the wall.

Clear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a LARGE SWORDFISH
mounted on the wall.

The Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted
SWORDFISH. The supporting brackets give, causing the SWORDFISH TO TIP
and SLIDE DOWNWARD!

Clear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill
impales the seat cushion between her legs!

                     CLEAR
             Fuck. Should have seen that
             coming. The institution's made me
             soft.

Clear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. Eugene
isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen.

                      EUGENE
             If Death has got such a hard-on for
             you, maybe you should get the hell
             away from us.

                      KIMBERLY
             We need her. She's the only one
             who's dealt with this before,
             idiot!

Kimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst. Clear, however, looks
grateful.

                      CLEAR
             We're all going to have to open our
             eyes from now on. Look out for
             each other. Sleep in shifts.
                    (looks around apartment)
             And we've got to safeproof this
             deathtrap.

MONTAGE - SAFEPROOFING THE APARTMENT

Everyone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the
fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp
objects away, affix padding to chart corners...

Kat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box,
nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. Thomas watches as he takes a
hanging mirror off the wall.

                      KAT
             Screw this. I'm going outside for
             a smoke.

                      THOMAS
             You think you should?     It's not
             safe out there.

                      KAT
             So? Nora's gotta bite it before me
             anyway, right?

Kat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and
grabs it just in case. Thomas smiles 'good job' at her.

Kimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when Nora rises from
the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket. Kimberly
looks concerned.

                      KIMBERLY
             Where are you going, Nora?    You
             okay?

Nora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated.

                      NORA
             Four years ago my husband died.
             Now Tim. There's nothing left for
             me.

Kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain.

                      KIMBERLY
             Don't say that. Once you lose
             hope, it's already too late.

Eugene snickers. Nora looks up, anger surfacing.

                       NORA
              If it's my time to go, to be in
              heaven with my family, then I can
              accept that.

                      KIMBERLY
             You can't give up. Don't accept
             Death's plan. Trust me, you can
             fight this. If we can just survive
             long enough until that baby is
             born, we can --

Nora looks more resolute than ever.

                       NORA
              If you'll excuse me, I have a
              funeral to prepare.

Everyone looks crushed when Nora heads for the door. Except Eugene,
who stands up as well.

                      EUGENE
             Yeah, why am I listening to a girl
             who just got out of the nut house?

As Eugene heads out, Kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him.

                      KIMBERLY
             Seeing you die once was enough for
             me.

                      EUGENE
             Whatever. I control my life, not
             fate.

                      CLEAR
             I'll be sure to put that on your
             tombstone.

Rory presses a cell phone into Eugene's hand on his way out.

                      RORY
             Be careful. And even if you don't
             believe, give this to Nora.


INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times. Nora nervously
ties her long hair back in a single braid.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.

RORY, standing on the couch, pulls a POLICE ACADEMY DIPLOMA off the
wall - and slips - stumbling BACKWARDS into the closet.

Staggering, he accidentally knocks some COAT HANGARS and a VOLLEYBALL
TROPHY from the high shelf to the floor.

Thomas whips around and sees that Rory's not hurt. He then lowers his
gaze and sees --

The figurine of a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY is framed by a tangled jumble of
wire COAT HANGARS. Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.
Oddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array.

From Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man
with hooks emanating from his body. The sodium vapor lamp casts an
OMINOUS GLOW around the image.

                      RORY
             ...man with hooks. I see a man
             with hooks. Someone?!?!

The others look over, trying to see what he does.

                      THOMAS
                    (unsure)
             I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's
             going to be killed by a man with
             hooks?

Kimberly and Clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp
ominously FLICKERS OUT AND DIES.

Everyone looks around for a hesitant beat, then Thomas picks up his
cell phone. Clear first walks, then RUNS out the door.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The elevator finally comes. Eugene and Nora get inside, standing in
front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of
PROSTHETIC LIMBS.

MUZAK plays AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL.

                      EUGENE
             Going down, right?

The Gaunt Man says nothing. The DOORS CLOSE.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Eugene stares blankly at the CONCAVE MIRROR in the upper corner. He's
disturbed by the WARPED REFLECTION OF:

THE GAUNT MAN leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally
close, he leans over and SMELLS it. Creepy.

                      EUGENE
             Um, by the way, your shoe's untied.

Nora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). She tries
tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell
phone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then
looks embarrassed.

                      EUGENE
             Probably for you, anyway.

Nora picks it up. STATIC CRACKLES. It's hard to make out Thomas'
yelling.

                          NORA
                 Officer Burke?   I can't hear...

A beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks
and hands of the Prosthetic limbs. Terror. She freezes.

                      EUGENE
             What is it? What's wrong?

But Nora's too frightened to speak. Eugene grabs the phone, hearing
unintelligible STATIC.

INTERCUT CLEAR

As she frantically hits the elevator button. When it fails to come,
she runs downstairs.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Nora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer... As the
door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets
snagged on one of the PROSTHETIC HOOKS, YANKING her backwards.

                          NORA
                 Let me go let me go!

                      EUGENE
             Oh, watch it, you've caught your
             uh...

The Guant Man's sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his
outward appearance.

                      MAN
             Goodness gracious, darling, let me
             help you with...

Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid. Nora
desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the
elevator.

Kat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette.

                      KAT
             You alright, Nora?

The elevator DOORS begin to close, and CLAMP around Nora's neck, her
head inside, body outside the elevator.

Eugene pounds on the BUMPERS, but they don't seem to work!

                          NORA
                 My God, someone please let me out
                 of this --

INTERCUT

The UP BUTTON is lit. Clear rushes to the lobby.

The Elevator RISES!

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level -
then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT!

Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor!

Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator
repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS.

Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.

It lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends.

Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs
to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail.

All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try
to pull her back down.

The elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down
into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering
away as the body convulses.

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

Eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A
bloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head,
still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.

The sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND
POUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator.

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Eugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently.
Kimberly, Thomas and Rory look on, bewildered.

                      EUGENE
             ...no escapes my ass. I control my
             fate. I die on my terms, hear me
             Reaper cockscuker?!

Eugene's in another world. He approaches Thomas and lunges for his
GUN - yanking it from the holster!

                      THOMAS
             What the hell are you...?

                       EUGENE
              Ain't going out like that.   On my
              terms!

                      THOMAS
             Just take it easy!

A twisted insane smile comes to Eugene's face as he jams the
gunbarrel to his temple. The others shrink back in terror.

He PULLS THE TRIGGER. CLICK! Eugene tries again. CLICK!

Thomas looks stunned as Eugene goes through every round, CLICK CLICK
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLI CK...

Kimberly breaths a sigh of relief.

                      KIMBERLY
             You don't keep it loaded?

Thomas' eyes disagree. He reaches in and GRABS the gun away from
Eugene, who stands there trembling. Thomas cracks open the cylinder.
Loaded.

                      RORY
             Maybe they were all duds.

                       THOMAS
              Six in a row? Never. Impossible.
              That's like
                     (sinking realization)
              ...winning the lottery.

                       CLEAR (O.S.)
              It wasn't his turn to die.

Everyone turns to see Clear and Kat, standing in the doorway,
DRENCHED IN BLOOD. Kat trembles uncontrollably.

                      KAT
             Can we find the pregnant woman,
             please?

                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - DAWN

Flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room. In
the newly conformed safe house, Kat and Clear relax as best they can
in Thomas' dry clothes.

Thomas makes another phone call. In the corner, Eugene shivers to
himself. Desperately looking for signs of danger. He looks over to
Clear.

                      EUGENE
             Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about
             before. I...

                      CLEAR
             Your entire world view just went
             out the window. I couldn't expect
             a religious conversation overnight.
             We'll get through this.
                    (beat)
             I promise.

Eugene looks immensely relieved. Rory ambles over to Kimberly, his
typical callousness gone.

                      RORY
             Can I ask you a question?

                       KIMBERLY
              Sure.

                       RORY
              When I die. Is it gonna hurt?

                      KIMBERLY
             I...I don't know.

Rory nods. He expected as much. He fishes his LICENSE and KEYS out of
his pocket.

                       RORY
              And you're gonna die after me,
              right?

                      KIMBERLY
             I guess so.

                      RORY
                    (re: keys and license)
             Would you take these? And if I
             die...
                    (tears well up)
             Could you throw all my drugs out?
             Paraphernalia, porno, you know...
             Anything that would break my mom's
             heart.

Kimberly looks deeply into his eyes, looking for the punchline. When
she doesn't see one, she nods tenderly and takes the keys.

The PHONE RINGS. Rory jumps at the sound, paranoid eyes in scan mode.
Thomas answers, speaks softly, hangs up.

                      THOMAS
             A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella
             Cruz is being detained up in
             Greenwood. Let's finish this
             thing.

EXT. COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

Kat's Ford Expedition winds its way through rural New York.

A SPORTS CAR speeds past on the left, then as it pulls in front of
the Exped ition, its slipstream sucks over some debris from the
shoulder; a thin metal piece of trim, which bounces in front of Kat's
Expedition's left front tire.

CU KAT'S WHEEL WELL -- the metal trim is shot upward into the wheel
well, where it lodges firmly, its sharp metal edge GRINDING AGAINST
THE RUBBER.

INSIDE THE CAR

Kat drives, Thomas reading directions in the shotgun seat. Kimberly,
Eugene and Rory ride in back. In the CARGO area, Clear scans out the
rear window for danger.

Rory fidgets.

                         RORY
                Is this safe, guys? I mean,
                someone in this car is about to get
                whacked. Do the rest of us really
                feel like sitting next to him?
                       (off Kat's glare)
                Or her. Hopefully her.

An uncomfortable beat.

                         THOMAS
                Guys, let's not panic.   Isabella's
                safe.

                          KIMBERLY
                 How do you know?

                         THOMAS
                You said she was going to drive
                into a lake. How can she when
                she's in protective custody?

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Isabella, pissed, is in a holding tank. Small town deputy STEVE
ADAMS, 30's, CLEANS HIS GUN in her direction.

                         ISABELLA
                What do you mean "grand theft
                auto?" This is insane.

                          STEVE
                Hopefully the district judge can
                straighten it all out by Monday
                mor ning.

                         ISABELLA
                       (figures it out)
                Jorge. When I get out of here I'm
                going to sue his cheating ass off.

As she fumes, a rivulet of WATER streaks down her leg.

                          IS ABELLA
                 Oh my God.

Steve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps.

                         STEVE
                Are you kidding me?!   Oh, man.

He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.

                         STEVE
              C'mon.    Let's go.

As Steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem:
GREENWOOD LAKE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Small town station. Only one patrol car. In the patrol car, Isabella
buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her
belly.

Deputy Steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start.

                       STEVE
              Damn, they always stick me with the
              clunker.

                       ISABELLA
              Take my van!

EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - DAY

KAT'S EXPEDITION speeds through a yellow light and continues on.

CLOSE ON EXPEDITION'S LEFT TIRE

Metal sheers away more rubber.

INSIDE THE EXPEDITION

Rory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two Yankee tickets.

                       RORY
              Here's what I don't get. For nine
              months, Death does all this shit to
              make sure I win these tickets and
              end up on Route 18 at exactly the
              right time for the pile up...

                        KAT
              Yeah?

                       RORY
              But why single me out? What am I
              in the great scheme of things?
              You'd think I stepped off Flight
              180 or something... Fucking weird,
              man.

                       THOMAS
              You want weird? Last year, my
              partner and I were heading out for
              the graveyard shift. A call comes
              in about a train wreck and Frank
              decides to let me handle it alone.

                    (beat)
             Frank died that night in a
             shootout. I'd be dead too if that
             call had come in just ten seconds
             later.

Everyone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way.

                      KAT
             I got that beat. So like, last
             May, I was supposed to stay at this
             cheesy bed and breakfast in
             Pennsylvania. There was a major
             gas leak no one knew about and all
             the guests suffocated during the
             night.

                      RORY
             Yeah, so what happened?

                      KAT
             I never mad it. The Greyhound bus
             I was on splattered some chick all
             over the road and we had to stop.

                      CLEAR
             Was that in Mt. Abraham?

                        KAT
              Yeah.   How did you know?

                      CLEAR
                    (sinking realization)
             That bus you were on? It killed
             Terry Mathers. She was supposed to
             die on Flight 180.

                      KAT
             I'm not sure I--

                       THOMAS
              Shit. The call about the train
              wreck that saved my life? That was
              the night I scraped up Billy
              Hitchcock.

                       RORY
              Who?

                      KIMBERLY
             Another kid from Flight 180.

A chill passes over the group.

INT. WINDING ROADS - DAY

Deputy Steve speeds the White Van up the narrow winding road.
Isabella breathes Lamaze- style through intense pain.

                       ISABELLA
              Promise me...I won't have the

              baby...in this van.

Speeding up the incline, Steve tries to speed around a Volkswagon
Beetle, but cars scream by in the opposite direction.

                       ISABELLA
              Get around it!!!

Steve leans on the horn and stomps the gas, dangerously riding the
shoulder around the Beetle.

Way ahead of the Beetle, on the left side, is a LAKE.

EXT. WINDING ROADS

BRIAN GIBBONS, 15, cheerfully drives a TRACTOR hauling a WHOODCHIPPER
across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick
branches.

The Tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road. He tries
the ignition, pumps the gas. Nothing...

Only by standing on the tractor can Brian see the White Van speeding
up the hill toward him. He jumps down and frantically tires starting
the tractor. Once, twice, nothing.

EXT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS

CU FRONT TIRE - METAL shreds away more rubber.

INT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS

Rory excitedly makes a connection.

                      RORY
             Remember the theater in Paris that
             collapsed last year, killed
             everyone inside?

Everyone nods, anticipating...

                      RORY
             I had tickets to go, but one day
             I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid,
             sippin' lattes an' such, and this
             dude gets whacked by a falling
             sign.

                        CLEAR
              Carter.

                      RORY
             Freaked me out so bad I hid in a
             shopping cart for four hours.
             'Course, missed the show...

                        CLEAR

                 What about you, Kimberly?   Did you
                 anyone from Flight- ?

Clear stops when she sees all the color has drained from Kimberly's
face. Even Eugene looks concerned.

                      EUGENE
             Are you okay?

The car becomes completely silent (except for the slight SCRAPING) as
Kimberly prepares to tell her story.

                      KIMBERLY
             A little over a year ago, my mother
             and I went to the mall. I was
             supposed to meet her outside, but I
             got caught up watching some news
             report about some kid who committed
             suicide. I kept thinking, "How can
             you strangle yourself in a
             bathtub?" That's retarded.

Thomas mouths, "Tod?" to Clear. Clear nods.

                          KIMBERLY
                 It felt wrong. And yet...
                        (continuing)
                 There were gunshots outside and I
                 ran...
                        (chokes up)
                 Some kids tried to jack her car.
                 She fought them off - she was a
                 fighter - and they killed her.

Kimberly looks to Clear.

                      KIMBERLY
             After the funeral I had this
             overwhelming feeling that it should
             have been me. I figured that's how
             everyone must feel. But I guess I
             was right.

Thomas reaches between the seats and takes Kimberly's hand. As he
looks into her eyes, Kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a
cigarette.

INTERCUT BRIAN

The tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. Brian grabs a
cord and starts up the whoodchipper.

INT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS

                      CLEAR
             It's all starting to come together.
             When Alex got us off Flight 180, it
             didn't just change our lives. It

               affected everyone and everything
               we've come into contact with ever
               since.

                        EUGENE
               I'm not sure I understand.

                        CLEAR
               Being alive after our time caused
               an outward ripple - a rift in
               Death's design.

Eugene nods, slowly getting it.

                        EUGENE
               So if you never got off the plane,
               none of us would be ali ve in the
               first place.

                        CLEAR
               That's why Death is working
               backwards. It's tying up all the
               loose ends, sealing the rift once
               and for all ­

CU LEFT TIRE

A thick retread sheers itself onto the pavement.

BRIAN

The wood chipper roar s loudly. Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk
SHOOTS from the spout --

The airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve
veers out of control.

Kat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly
jerks the wheel to the right.

Kat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire
SUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the
oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van!

Isabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van
has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road
toward a LAKE!

                          STEVE
               Hang on!

The SUV misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the
embankment, spinning and rolling towards --

THE GIBBONS' FARM

At the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a PROPANE TANK sits
at the edge of the property!

The SUV barrels down the hill - coming right for it!

INSIDE THE SUV

All Kat can do is cover her head with her arms.

THE WHITE VAN

Speeding toward the lake! Isabella SCREAMS, in pain, not fear. The
White Van is ready for splashdown.

Steve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator. He's
able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard
jerk.

                         STEVE
                We're okay, we're okay.

THE PROPANE TANK

It's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely
misses it! It continues, backwards, CRASHING through a temporary
fence and right into --

AN AGRICULTURAL CONSTRUCTION SITE!

The Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation
ditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere.

Just as the Expedition comes to a stop, an IRRIGATION PIPE ROCKETS
through the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory --
coming to a rest just behind Kat's head.

INSIDE THE WHITE VAN

Steve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows
down. Isabella squeezes his hand white.

                          ISABELLA
                Please.   It's not going to wait.

                         STEVE
                I've got to stop and help those
                people.

                          ISABELLA
                 Do you want to deliver this baby?

Steve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash. He
floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio.

THE EXPEDITION

The dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET
WHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL
SPIKE that skewers the vehicle.

Rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it.
Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to
open the door, but it won't budge.

                       KAT
              Not my time.     Amazing...

                          THOMAS
                 Is everybody alright?

A BLOODY HAND SEIZES HIS SHOULDER!

Thomas turns to see

Eugene SPASMING in the back seat! He clutches his ribcage in agony
and wheezes! Blood trickles from his mouth.

                       KAT
              He can't breathe!        He can't
              breathe!

                          CLEAR
                 Oh my god, Eugene!?

Eugene's head tilts forward, unconscious.

EXT. GIBBONS' FARM - DAY

BRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward
the accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made
from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires.

Brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK
TREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a
double-wide construction trailer.

                        MR. GIBBONS (O.S.)
              Call 9- 1-1!

WE FOLLOW BRIAN

To the crash site. Brian's jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight
of a guy and a girl dragging a blood- soaked man from the back seat to
perform CPR on him.

Around Brian, voices mesh in a surreal haze.

                       THOMAS
              Stop it, don't move him!

                         KIMBERLY

               He can't breathe damn it.   I think
               his lung's collapsed!

                        CLEAR
               Someone call for help!

We STEADICAM around Brian to reveal a woman screaming from the
driver's seat. The sound is surreal.

                        KAT
               I can't move my fucking leg!
               Please get me out of here before it
               explodes!

The color drains from Brian's face as the dying man on the ground
coughs blood and the girl performing CPR recoils.

The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from
the horrors he can't face. Into the street --

And Rory yanks him back from imminent death as an AMBULANCE SPEEDS
onto the property.

                        RORY
               Watch it, dude!

That SNAPS Brian back to reality. Sounds become normal again. Brian
collects himself and SNIFFS the air. He then drops to ground level,
looking under the Expedition for something.

                        KIMBERLY
               Help us, we need help over here!

                        BRIAN
                      (to Kat, reassuringly)
               I don't smell any gas. And none's
               dripping, either.

Brian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped
leg. He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick
flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to YANK the door open with all
his might.

No good, Kat SCREAMS in pain.

                        KAT
               Stop that! I still need this foot,
               thank you.

Brian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GIBBON'S FARM - LATER

Clear watches two EMTS lo ad Eugene into the back of an ambulance. An
oxygen mask has been placed over his mouth.

                      CLEAR
             Be careful with that, check the
             gages on the regulator and be
             mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch
             for potholes and puddles.

As Clear continues, the exasperated Paramedics do their best to
ignore her. When she tries to climb inside, she is pushed away.

                      CLEAR
             Look, I made him a promise --

                        PARAMEDIC
              Sorry.   There's no room.

Again, she's shoved away and steps back, helpless.

Thomas and Kimberly stand by Kat, still trapped in the SUV.

                      THOMAS
             Get that over here!   Move move
             move!

A RESCUE WORKER carries the JAWS of LIFE past Clear towards the
Expedition.

                       RESCUE WORKER
              Excuse me, hot soup coming through.

The hydraulic hose that leads back to the Power Unite WRAPS AROUND
CLEAR'S LEG.

As the hose tightens, Clear realizes she's surrounded by shards of
glass and metal. She quickly WRESTLES herself free of the hose and
watches the Paramedics lock Eugene's gurney into place.

                      CLEAR
             One more thing.   Watch out for
             power lines.

The doors slam, revealing the PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL logo. The
ambulance speeds off, spraying gravel at her.

She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a CRUSHED cell phone. Shit.
She runs back over to Thomas.

                       CLEAR
              We have to contact Isabella now!

A NEWS VAN tries to weave through the emergency vehicles to get
closer to teh accident.

ANGLE ON NEWS VAN UNDERCARRIAGE

It sinks into the loose dirt, SCRAPING A LARGE ROCK. The gas tank
PUNCTURES.

EMT'S angrily wave the news van back to the road, where it parks near
the twin wire fence opposite the DEAD OAK TREE.

Immediately, A CAMERA CREW exits the van to catch the action. Rory
steps behind the News Van, making sure he can't be seen, and digs
into his sock, coming up with a bindle. A SMILE...

                        THOMAS (O.S.)
              Rory!!!

Rory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then EXITS FRAME. WE
PUSH IN, the news van gas tank is leaking. A SMALL DRIP...

EXT. GIBBON'S FARM - CONTINUOUS

Thomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the JAWS OF LIFE being clamped
onto Kat's door.

                       THOMAS
              Where's the cell phone Clear gave
              you?

                       RORY
              I dunno. I think I gave it to
              Eugene back at your place.

                       THOMAS
              Damn it. We have to call the
              Greenwood Police Station and warn
              Isabella.

Thomas runs in the direction of some local POLICE. After he leaves,
Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket.

Kimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the
Expedition.

                       KIMBERLY
              You doing alright in there?

                       KAT
              My legs are starting to cramp up.
              And God, why am I so thirsty? Does
              anyone have any Fiji?

The KA-CHUNK of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to
death.

                       KAT
              Christ, you wanna give me a heads
              up next time, pal?

Brian and Mr. Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water. They hand it
to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway.

CUT TO:

THE DRIP

Of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle. GAS SLITHERS over packed
dirt, around debris, toward the crash site.

BACK TO:

THOMAS DARK ROOM

Speaks to another COP who clicks off his radio.

                       COP
              She's at Phelps Memorial. They're
              prepping her to give birth right
              now.

                       THOMAS
              Where's that?

                       COP
              A few miles up the road.   Near the
              docks.

KAT

Lights one cigarette off the other KA -CHUCNK! The sound makes her
flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor.

                       KAT
              Damn, can't you be quieter with
              that thing?

                       RESCUE WORKER
                     (dripping scorn)
              Sure, I'll just set it to the
              "quiet" mode.

Kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales.
KA-CHUNK!!! She jumps again, but maintains her composure.

MEANWHILE

The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through
pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas
even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty
feet closer to the site...

KIMBERLY

Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift
the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward
Kimberly.

                       THOMAS
              We gotta go now.   Isabella's in
              labor.

Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat
Flinches.

                       KIMBERLY
              What about that?

                       CLEAR
                     (calls over to Kat)
              How you doing in there, hero?

                       KAT
                     (re: spike behind head)
              I guess it could be worse.

Brian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers.

                       THOMAS
              So let's go...Where the hell is
              Rory?!

Thomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading
directly under the dead Oak Tree.

Rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the BINDLE. Enraptured, he
delicately unfolds it...

KIMBERLY

Is put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the
WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a
man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no
one there.

KA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat!
Everyone applauds!

                        KIMBERLY
              Wait!

Mr. Gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment
to sit on the bumper.

DEPLOYING THE AIRBAG!

SLAMMING Kat's head backwards through the spike, HEAD-KABOB.

Kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette -- which bounces along
the hard dirt -- toward the oncoming gas. Closer, closer,.. The
BREEZE KICKS UP, aiding the cigarette.

WHOOSH, the gas fuse catches. The blusih flame travels through pipes,
over rocks, racing toward the news VAN.

Kimberly , half-traumatized, watches an ominous BREEZE rustle through
the field, up to the trees, toward Thomas.

The GAS BURNS up an incline, and disappears into the ground... And
pops up twenty feet closer to the News Van.

Kimberly follows the BREEZE to the dead oak tree under which Thomas
stands. And blows a large branch until it snaps! A startled Thomas
sees it fall just in time to DIVE to safety.

Clear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van.

                      CLEAR
             Get back!

BOOM! The news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over
Thomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between
them. The flying garrote heads directly for --

Rory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile - and is
sliced into three sharp cuts of beef.

The silence from the emergency crew is deafening. Mr. Gibbons starts
crying hysterically.

                      MR. GIBBONS
             I didn't mean to do it - I didn't
             know.

Kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch, the one that caused
Thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence.

                      KIMBERLY
                    (to herself)
             It wasn't his turn.   And it's not
             my turn.

Kimberly sees the corpses of Kat and Rory, buries the pain, and
approaches Mr. Gibbons.

                      KIMBERLY
             Give me the keys to your truck.
             Now!

                      MR. GIBBONS
                    (hysterical)
             Anything you want. Anything.      I
             wish I knew. I didn't...

Mr. Gibbons hands Kimberly the keys.

EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - MOMENTS LATER

Kimberly drives Thomas and Clear in the Gibbons' truck. All are numb.

                      THOMAS
                    (buckling up)
             Hurry up. There's no time.   She's
             about to give birth.

Kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it.

                      CLEAR

             What are you doing?     You're going
             to kill us!

                      KIMBERLY
             No. If anyone dies from a crash
             now, it'll be me. But I can't die
             if Eugene and Isabella are still
             alive. I'm last on Death's list.

                      CLEAR
             Are you crazy? What makes you
             think you'd survive?

                      KIMBERLY
             What happened when Eugene tried to
             kill himself out of turn?

                      CLEAR
                    (considering)
             Six duds in a row.

                      KIMBERLY
             And when it was Rory's turn to die,
             and Thomas was in the way?

                      THOMAS
             That branch fell and saved my life.
             You're right, Death's maintaining
             the order.

                       KIMBERLY
              Let's pray that Isabella's still
              alive.

The truck speeds into the horizon.

EXT. PHELP'S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

Typical chatter as the staff preps Isabella. Steve paces nervously in
the background.

                      STAFF
             ...contractions coming quicker now.
             Take her pressure and CTG. One
             centimeter dilation. Prep the
             epidural stat.

Isabella breathes Lamaze style in the hospital bed, her feet in
stirrups. A NURSE rocks Isabella's body back and forth, until her
back arches almost unnaturally forward.

In the BG, an OBSTETRICIAN, 50s, sterilizes his hands in a scrub
sink.

A female ANESTHESIOLOGIST hustles over, swabbing a LONG EPIDURAL
NEEDLE. The nurse places a mask over Isabella's face. The
Anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of Isabella's spine.

                       ANESTHESIOLOGIST
              She's going to have to stop moving
              if I'm going to --

The Nurse SNEEZES.

                       ANESTHESIOLOGIST
              Goddamn it, keep her still!

                       NURSE
              Sorry, doctor.

XCU NEEDLE

Tracing skin between Isabella's constantly moving vertebra.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE

It buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors
and nurses, hovering above the --

ANESTHESIOLOGIST, who traces the long needle down Isabella's spine,
finding the proper vertebrae.

                       ANESTHESIOLOGIST
              Perfectly still now...

Everyone freezes. SILENCE. As the tip of the needle presses the skin
down --

The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear. And STINGS!

FLINCH!

The NEEDLE SINKS IN - a NURSE GASPS. Did something go wrong?

                       ANESTHESIOLOGIST
              Done.
                     (tears welling)
              Now could someone please find the
              open window and fucking close it?

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick
from wet leaves.

                       KIMBERLY
              This makes no sense. Isabella was
              supposed to crash her van into a
              lake. Could we have altered her
              destiny when we had her arrested?

                       CLEAR
              I don't think so. Alex's
              premonitions happened exactly as he
              saw them no matter how much we

               tried to change it.

                        THOMAS
               Then the only way to survive is to
               get to the hospital and protect
               Eugene and Isabella for as long as
               we can.

                        CLEAR
               If only Alex and I had done that
               with the others, Alex might still
               be...

A somber beat. Then Thomas looks over at the speedometer.

                        THOMAS
               Um, Kimberly? This is a
               neighborhood. You may wanna slow
               it down.

                        KIMBERLY
               Don't worry. Nothing can happen to
               us.

                        THOMAS
               I wasn't worried about us.

Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!

HARD CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

UNKNOWN POV

A NURSE hovers over us in a hospital, WRESTLING us down by the look
of things. There is SCREAMING all around. The image comes at us so
fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the NAMETAG on her uniform:

KALARJIAN

                        THOMAS (O.S.)
               Kimberly! Slow down!

                                     BACK TO:

INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly "comes to" at the wheel -- FLAILING DESPERATELY at the
steering wheel. She even claws at Thomas who tries to control the
neglected steering wheel.

                        CLEAR
               Slow down! We're...

Kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars
are backed up at a stop sign. Kimberly screams and SLAMS on the
brakes.

The truck SKIDS on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a
LANDSCAPING TRUCK parked on the shoulder.

Kimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty
feet into the air, DUKES OF HAZZARD-style.

And lands miraculously without a scratch! On a parallel road. And
keeps going. Dumb, insane fucking luck.

Kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window.
She turns around with a cocky smile.

She rubs her throat and FLOORS IT again to Thomas' horror, more
determined.

                       CLEAR
                     (eyes darting)
              What did you see? What am I
              looking for?

                       KIMBERLY
              No, it's not here. This one was
              different. More like the pile up
              and the van going into the lake.
              It wasn't just a sign, I was there.

                       CLEAR
                     (confused)
              Another premonition?

                       KIMBERLY
              Yes. I was in a hospital. There
              was screaming... A nurse was
              choking me. I couldn't tell wh at
              she looked like, but the name tag
              was right in my face. Kalarjian.

                       THOMAS
              Kalarjian?

                       KIMBERLY
              I think a nurse named Kalarjian is
              going to choke Isabella to death!

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

WIPING FRAME, a NURSE enters a room and reads a clipboard on an
unseen patient's bed.

REVEAL EUGENE lying in a hospital bed, wired to the latest medical
hardware. Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR
TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.

The NURSE'S HAND reaches down to Eugene's neck...

Eugene WINCES when the Nurse gives the tube a friendly little SHAKE
to check if it's stable.

                       NURSE

              Sorry. Can you feel that in your
              trachea?

Eugene rolls his eyes. Stupid question.

                       NURSE
              Quite complaining. I got burnt
              babies in the Children's Ward
              braver than you.

She sticks an electri c thermometer in his ear. Eugene opens his mouth
as if to speak.

                       NURSE
              Don't bother. You won't be talking
              for at least a month. Think you
              can handle that, Jabberjaw?

Eugene looks ready to cry. The Nurse sits on the bed, jarring Eugene
enough to make him WINCE again.

                       NURSE
              Don't worry. Everyone learns to
              love me once they get used to my
              sense of humor, okay?

Eugene looks grat eful to see a humane side to this creature.

EXT. WINDY ROADS - DAY

The pick up truck races to the hospital. As Kimberly speeds past a
billboard, a POLICE CAR pulls in hot pursuit.

                       KIMBERLY
              Shouldn't we pull over?

                       THOMAS
              No time. Keep going. I wouldn't
              know how to explain any of this
              anyway.

At the next intersection, TWO MORE COP CARS APPEAR.

                       KIMBERLY
              Oh come on.

The pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars, which
instantly join the high speed chase. Kimberly takes a long look in
the rearview mirror at the TAILGATING COPS. She then inspects the
road ahead.

UP IN THE DISTANCE

A busy six-lane intersection.

                       KIMBERLY
              What do you want me to do?

                      CLEAR
                    (hesitated beat)
             Speed up.

                       KIMBERLY
              Yeah, fuck 'em.
                     (to Thomas)
              No offense.

Kimberly SPEEDS toward the intersection. She pulls her seatbelt
aside, making sure it offers ZERO protection. Thomas jumps in the
backseat, buckles up...

                      CLEAR
             Be alive, Isabella, please be
             alive.

Kimberly's eyes widen in fear. Her foot hesitates over the brake
pedal as --

The truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection, miraculously
missing every car!

The police are just barely able to fishtail into 90 degree turns,
avoiding the intersection completely.

Kimberly's eyes open and she lets out a victory cry.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

ANGLE ON

Oxygen valve. PAN OVER AND DOWN TO

Eugene tries to watch a news flash of HIS accident on the TV across
the room, but a bulky ORDERLY blocks his view.

                      ANCHOR MAN (O.S.)
             ...ironically impaled through the
             head as a result of an emergency
             airbag deploying.

As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in
front of him, again obscuring his view. Eugene frantically pantomimes
writing.

                       ORDERLY
              Need a pen? Sure. If you like,
              I'll bring crosswords for you, too.

Eugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers
his movement.

                       ANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.)
              ...police Have speculated that one
              of the deaths may have been

              narcotics related and urge children
              to stay away from d rugs.

Finally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the TV. An
ANCHOR MAN taps his pages on the desktop.

                      ANCHOR MAN
             Good advice, Sue. And stay in
             school. Up next, Johnny Showers
             has the weather...

A WEATHERMAN dressed as a frog points out cloud formations.

Eugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing
the huge cart out of the room.

The sound of a SKIDDING CAR fills the room. It comes from the TV
which shows a PSA featuring CRASH TEST DUMMIES.

                       ORDERLY
              Jeez, it's freezing in here.

The Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, VENTS CLOSE just
below the ceiling.

Eugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong.

ANGLE ON OXYGEN HOSE -

Bursting. It HISSES softly. We follow the OBLIVIOUS ORDERLY out of
the room.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

A hospital ADMINISTRATOR briskly strides up to the Orderly.

                      ADMINISTRATOR
             What are you doing? The Henzels
             are still waiting for you in the
             Children's Ward --

The Orderly smacks his forehead - shit. Totally forgot.

                      ORDERLY
             Right, right, right.     Gregory's big
             day.

                      ADMINISTRATOR
             And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy
             can't feel her legs.

The Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. The
Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past.

The HUGE CART. Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room.

EXT. PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly seems to have ditched the cops. She speeds the pick up
through the medical facility.

EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

The pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital. Kimberly,
Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

The OXYGEN HOSE hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the TV.
Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial
ends. The n, a NEWS REPORT comes on. The BANNER:

ROUTE 18 TRAGEDY

Footage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons,
and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over:

                       ANCHOR    WOMAN (O.S.)
             Mor e tears were    shed this morning
             in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy
             that rocked the     Tri -State area...

Suddenly, the FRAYED ELECTRIC CORD of Eugene's TV begins sparking.
The sound DROPS OUT, the picture SPUTTERS.

Eugene goes white with terror. He looks back to --

The broken OXYGEN TUBE. HISSING softly. The BEEPS of the EEG machine
frantically increase. Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch.
Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters.

INT. NURSES STATION - DAY

Clear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk.

                       CLEAR
              Isabella Cruz.    What room's she in?

                       RECEPTIONIST
              I'm sorry, I can't give out that
              info unless you're a relative.

                       CLEAR
              I'm her sister.

The Receptionist eyes her dubiously.

                      RECEPTIONIST
             I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz.

Clear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and
seizes the computer. Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned.

                      CLEAR
             Delivery rooms are downstairs.
             I'll find Eugene and catch up with
             you.

Kimberly and Thomas hurry to the elevator banks...then reconsider and
enter the stairwell.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eugene scratches the top sheet of the bed, trying to inch the call-
switch closer and closer to him. But it won't budge.

A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and
disappears by his stomach!

He pounds desperately on the empty food tray, his side rails, looks
toward the door --

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Outside the door, you can't hear a thing in the bustling hallway as
people rush by. Kimberly and Thomas rush past his door, lost.

                          THOMAS
                 Hurry, I think she's this way.

BACK TO EUGENE

His eyes scream insanely, but he respirator tube prevents any sound
from escaping him. And that's when the RAT appears on the floor and
begins gnawing on the respirator's power cord!

When Eugene sees this, the EEG machine climbs off the charts.

INT. NURSES STATION - CONTINUOUS

Clear takes off down the hallway. The Receptionist, shaken, dials her
phone.

                          RECEPTIONIST
                 Security?

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Obstetrician voices concern.

                          OBSTETRICIAN
                 Listen to me, Isabella, I need you
                 to stop pushing.

                          ISABELLA
                 What's wrong? IS the baby all
                 right?

                          OBSTETRICIAN
                 It's a breach. If I can't reverse

              it, we may need to do a Caesarian.

The Obstetrician's hands go to work. Steve looks ill.

                       STEVE
              Maybe I should step outside.

INTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS

Running down the corridor.

                       PA ANNOUNCEMENT
              Code Blue in Delivery Room 6.   Code
              Blue!

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

The rat GNAWS away at Eugene's power cord, Eugene looks trapped,
helpless, tortured.

His eyes dart from the sparking TV to the gnawed power cord to the
useless call- switch.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Clear walks up and down the corridor, scanning room numbers as she
passes. A -169, A- 171, A-173...

                       CLEAR
              B-187...B-187...

A HAND suddenly GRABS Clear and shoves her against the wall. REVEAL A
SECURITY GUARD leering at her.

                      SECURITY GUARD
             Just where do you think you're
             going?

Clear struggles to get away, getting sympathetic looks from an OLD
MAN walking a rolling IV STAND down the corridor.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Isabella is pushing again.

                       OBSTETRICIAN
              Almost there. I see the head...

The NURSE takes a pair of SCISSORS off a tray.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Clear plays possum, offering no resistance to the Security Guard as
the Old Man wheels his IV STAND along.

Suddenly, Clear grabs the stand - and WHAMS the heavy wheeled base
into the Guard's BALLS! As the Guard recoils, she thoughtfully hands
the IV back to the Old Man and runs.

INT. DELIVERY ROOM 0 CON

The Nurse is startled when Kimberly and Thomas BURST THROUGH the
door. In the BG, a puzzled Steve peeks inside until Kimberly pulls
the door closed.

                      NURSE
             What are you doing in here?    Get
             the hell out! Right now!

Finally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to
swaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking
Isabella.

                       OBSTETRICIAN
              Isabella, look down and see your
              son.

To the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST
INTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other.

It's a magical moment --

EXT. EUGENE'S PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense
relief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt
pocket and lighting a victory cigar.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Relaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the
delivery room as Clear runs up to them.

                      CLEAR
             A guard grabbed me before I could
             find Eugene.

                      THOMAS
             Don't sweat it.   It's over.

                      CLEAR
             She had the baby?

                      KIMBERLY
             New life defeats death. We've done
             it. Death has to rewrite the list.
             We're safe.

Steve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and HUGS the
others.
Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her.
Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision --

HARD CUT TO:

UNKOWN POV

Looking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined!

                        THOMAS (O.S.)
               Kimberly! Are you okay?!


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT

Kimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her
trance. Thomas helps her to her feet.

                        THOMAS
               Are you okay? You just face
               planted!

                        KIMBERLY
               I know how it feels to be dead.

Her lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably. Clear sees TWO
SECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others
toward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE.

                        CLEAR
               What did you see?

                        KIMBERLY
               I was dead. And came back to life.
               An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?

                        THOMAS
               But it's over. Isabella's baby was
               the key. You saw her die and
               everything, right?

                        KIMBERLY
               I don't...what if I made a mistake?

                        THOMAS
               Impossible. She was on the onramp.

Kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers.

CUT TO:

PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN

Moment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly
suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder.

Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an
accident.

BACK TO:

Kimberly, overcome with self- doubt.

                       KIMBERLY
              I'm not sure... I don't think
              Isabella was ever destined to die
              in the pile -up.

                       THOMAS
              Then what's the premonition of the
              lake supposed to mean?

                       CLEAR
              Can you remember anything about it?

Kimberly shuts her eyes, remembering:

EXT. LAKE - DAY

POV DRIVER

Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van
speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE!

The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In
moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped.
Drowning. Horrible.

And on the rearview mirror, six floral scented AIR-FRESHNERS.

BACK TO:

Kimberly looks down at her grease -covered hands and looks ill.

                       KIMBERLY
              ...the Same hands from the van.

Finally everything makes sense to Clear.

                       CLEAR
              It's you Kimberly. The
              premonitions are about you.

Kimberly trembles, refusing to accept what she's hearing.

                        KIMBERLY
              No!   It can't be.

                       CLEAR
                     (suddenly remembering)
              I have to save Eugene!

Clear leaves Kimberly and Thomas together. Kimberly verges on tears
and Thomas consoles her with a hug.

IN THE BACKGROUND

Clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor.
She comes to a room with a HUGE CART parked outside, blocking the
door. She looks up to see - B -187.

Clear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door.

                           CLEAR
                Eugene?    Are you in there?

EUGENE'S ROOM

Eugene strains to hear through the thick door.

                         CLEAR (O.S.)
                Can you hear me? I'm coming in .

An intense wave of relief washes over Eugene.

BACK TO:

As Kimberly hugs Thomas, she watches Clear push the cart past the
door.

                         ORDERLY (O.S.)
                Make way, make way lovebirds.

Kimberly spins as Eugene's Orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a
crossword book in one hand, A BIRTHDAY CAKE in the other.

The CAKE reads "Happy Birthday Gregory". The THIRTEEN SPARKLING
CANDLES on top ODDLY FRAME Clear's head.

                           KIMBERLY
                Oh no...

The Orderly speeds down the corridor toward Clear, whose hand reaches
for Eugene's door handle. She leans into it --

                         ORDERLY
                       (to Clear)
                Thanks hon, the Henzels are going
                crazy for this thing.

THOMAS AND KIMBERLY

Watch as Clear opens the door, briefly revealing Eugene, a whoosh of
Oxygen --

BOOM!!!

Clear's body is obscenely hurled END OVER END towards the CAMERA,
heading straight for Kimberly and Thomas!

Thomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being
crushed by Clear's lifeless body!

The hospital erupts in total chaos. Just as Kimberly is about to
break down completely, she sees --

A WOMAN hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash
cart.

Kimberly sees the nametag: KALARJIAN.

                         KIMBERLY
                Nurse Kalarjian...

                         DR. KALARJIAN
                Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me,
                please.

ANGLE ON CART

DEFRIBULATOR PADDLES rest on top. And then Dr. Kalarjian passes them
toward the area of the explosion.

KIMBERLY OMINOUSLY TURNS, the camera following her view, until she
sees a small lake across the street from the hospital.

                         KIMBERLY
                Oh my God. That's it. The lake.
                The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.

                         THOMAS
                What?

Just then, an AMBULANCE SKIDS up to the nearest entrance. PARAMEDICS
jump out and run towards the blast site.

                         KIMBERLY
                You can't cheat destiny. I know
                what I have to do to save us. I
                have to die.

                         THOMAS
                That's crazy. You can't give up
                now. We can still fight this
                thing.

But Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at
the --

AMBULANCE

A red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six
floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from
her vision! And it's running!

                         KIMBERLY
                I have to do this.

Kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns
and runs before he can speak.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost
seems to swing open for her as she gets in.

INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which
SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart.

EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the
doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance,
rushes outside.

                      EMT
             What the fuck?!

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Thomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over
curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the
lake!

Thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far
behind.

INSIDE THE AMBULANCE

Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a
final gasp of air --

ON THE LAKE'S EDGE

Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle
descends below the surface -- and he dives in!

UNDERWATER

Thomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets
to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his
baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing!

He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of
the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically...

And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything --

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

BLACKNESS.

                      DR. KALARJIAN (O.S.)
             Ready and...CLEAR!

The SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life.

KIMBERLY'S POV

Looking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's
face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian".

It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but --

An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same
POV as the premonition.

                      NURSE
             She's back!

                          DR. KALARJIAN
                 Five CC's of narcodon. I want her
                 stabilized and prepped for ICU.

Kimberly turns her head to see

THOMAS

Unconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking
wet). Thomas doesn't respond.

An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes
his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR.

Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS
UPRIGHT.

                      THOMAS
             Kimberly?!

He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved,
he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the
platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.

                      KIMBERLY
                    (whispering)
             Welcome back. We did it.           For
             real.

                           THOMAS
                 I know.   I can feel it too.

Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood
into the hospital. Its light covers Kimberly and Thomas with an
ethereal glow. There are no more doubts; they've won.

They exchange meek, yet triumphant smiles in the smoky, chaotic
hospital.

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

We are at a summer barbecue. Frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et.
Everyone's happy.

TITLE CARD: FIVE MONTHS LATER

ANGLE ON

Shish -Kabob entering a mouth.

REVEAL

Kimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the
metal skewer from her mouth.

                       KIMBERLY
              My God, this is delicious. I can't
              believe I used to be a vegan.

Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer
is deep in his mouth --

A running FRISBEE PLAYER accidentally bumps into Thomas! But no harm.
Thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his
mouth around the shish-kabob.

                       MR. BURROUGHS (O.S.)
              So what's the deal, Thomas? Three
              months and you still haven't asked
              my daughter out on a date.

Kimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.

                       THOMAS
              What's wrong with a platonic
              relationship?

                       MR. GIBBONS
              Platonic my ass. That's for ugly
              women.

                       KIMBERLY
              For God's sake, leave him alone,
              Dad.

                       THOMAS
                     (smiling)
              Yeah, don't make me cite you for
              harassment.

                       MR. GIBBONS
              Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone.
                     (looking around, lowering
                          voice)
              Besides, if you can beat Death,

             what's he got to worry about me
             for?

Mr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife,
MRS. GIBBONS, joins.

                      MR. GIBBONS
             You know, you still never explained
             to us how you did it.

It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.

                      THOMAS
             Well, technically when we died, we
             gave Death what it wanted. And by
             the time we were revived, it had
             already moved on to graver
             pastures.

Mrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She
changes the conversation.

                      MRS. GIBBONS
             You know, I'm having the greatest
             day?

                      KIMBERLY
             Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons.
             Big props to you and Brian.

                       MRS. GIBBONS
             Our...pleasure. So, ready for the
             back-to -school season? NYU, right?

                      KIMBERLY
             Three short glorious weeks away.

                      MRS. GIBBONS
             Sounds wonderful. I wish I were
             going myself.

                      MR. GIBBONS
                    (to Mr. Burroughs)
             You may want to think twice about
             letting her live in the village,
             Bob. Our eldest daughter moved
             there and came back with piercings
             all over her face.
                    (looks grave)
             Among other places.

A chorus of friendly laughter.

                      BRIAN (O.S.)
             Dad used to call her the
             pincushion. From Hellraiser.

BRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full
of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.

                        BRIAN
               Dad, you had the spatula last,
               right?

                        MR. GIBBONS
               Sure, here.

Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera,
SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between
Kimberly and Thomas' heads.

                        KIMBERLY
               Brian looks like he's having fun.

                        MR. GIBBONS
               Sure does. Owes it to that friend
               of yours, in a way.

Mr. Gibbons immediately regrets having said that.

                        KIMBERLY
               How's that?

                        MR. GIBBONS
               Well, Brian was nearly hit by an
               ambulance the day...but your friend
               Rory pulled him back at the last
               second.

Kimberly and Thomas ominously turn their heads around. In the BG,
Brian fidgets in front of the barbecue.

                        MRS. GIBBONS
               You never told me that, Peter.
               Boy, that was lucky.

BOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening
silence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons'
plate. PLOP.

FADE TO BLACK.

                                    2ND REVISED DRAFT

                                     February 8, 1993

                

               TITLES UNFOLD IN BLACKNESS as we are lulled by the distant 
               flute-like sounds of a recorder. Overall the effect is 
               mournful and haunting, elegant and serene...

               ...and we CRASH TO:

               EXT - BARENTS SEA - NIGHT

               ...a storm of inconceivable force and violence. Merciless 
               arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells.

               This is the last place in God's creation that any human being 
               should be. And yet...

               ...the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before 
               us, looming from the darkness and chaos. it crashes upward 
               through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- 
               first into the trough. The sails on the forward mast are 
               still deployed. It's insane; in this weather they should be 
               stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3).

               Hurtling toward us. Rising and falling. Thundering through 
               the swells. And as she sweeps past CAMERA within a seeming 
               hairbreadth, we PAN with the ship and find ourselves...

               EXT - SHIP - NIGHT

               ...aboard the "Alexander Nevsky," along for the ride whether 
               we like it or not. There are men all around us, dark screaming 
               FIGURES glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes 
               flapping in the gale. A GROUP OF MEN are in a life-or-death 
               tug of war

                                     WALTON
                         PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!

               Riiiiippp! All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears 
               loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing 
               tatters. The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, 
               trailing rope and fabric. The men dive aside as the jib 
               smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. Splintered 
               shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel.

               Walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- 
               down on the pitching deck.

               GRIGORI, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid. Walton 
               shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. LIGHTNING 
               throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: 
               blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, 
               staining his teeth. He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact 
               and straining against the wind. We hear a huge CRACK!

               The base of the mast is starting to give.

                                     WALTON
                         Cut the damn rigging free before we 
                         lose the mast!

               Long-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. Frantic men 
               begin hacking at the ropes. Walton snatches an axe from a 
               passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. He attacks 
               a guy-rope with primal fury, CAMERA rising and falling with 
               the motion of his axe. Suddenly, a chilling cry from high 
               above:

                                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
                         IIIICEBEEEEERG!

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope 
               knotted at the chest. He points ahead.

               WALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF 
               THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. 
               The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting 
               the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying 
               these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine 
               field.

               An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the 
               foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us 
               into darkness...

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               ...and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas 
               billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in 
               breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before 
               them like a ghostly white mountain. Walton finds his voice:

                                     WALTON
                         HARD TO PORT!

               THE PILOT fights to turn the wheel. Men rush to his aid, 
               throw their backs into it, straining to the limit. The wheel 
               is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way.

               PUSH IN on Walton and the crew:

                                     GRIGORI
                         It's going to ram us.

                                     WALTON
                         It wouldn't dare.

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around 
               his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands. Face 
               white with terror. Breath coming in ragged gasps.

               SHIP'S POV

               Crashing through the swells. Rising and falling. Tilting the 
               world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming.  For a 
               brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing 
               back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge...

               ...and smack the ice.

               VARIOUS QUICK-CUT ANGLES

               God just hit the ship with an anvil. Mast #1 snaps at the 
               base with a thunderous CRACK and begins to topple in a 
               symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging...

               The lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the 
               crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs 
               windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below... 

               And is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around 
               his chest, We hear another horrible CRACK... the sound of 
               his back breaking...

               Men are sliding, tumbling, screaming. Mast #1 completes its 
               fall, slamming massively to the deck, shattering a section 
               of the gunwale to splinters. Utter panic. Total chaos...

               Sheer mortal terror. And as the sequence builds to a final 
               brain-splitting crescendo of sound and fury, we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               Total, stunning silence.

               A glittering wasteland of ice. Breathlessly cold. Even the 
               sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. Pellets of 
               snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a 
               desolate arctic wind. It's as if Hell had erupted through 
               the floor of the Earth in the form of ice. Nothing could 
               survive here. Nothing. 

               SLOW PAN reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at 
               a permanent list. Silent. We see no signs of life.

               SUPE TITLE: "The Arctic, 1839."

               VARIOUS LINGERING ANGLES provide ominous detail-shots of the 
               Nevsky

               A flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind...

               The pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice. The 
               forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, 
               extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging...

               The ship's prow is smashed open above the water line...

               A familiar rosary lies broken on the deck. Beads scattered. 
               |A tiny Christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted 
               eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice...

               HIGH, HIGH ANGLE

               From the top of mast #2. A breathtaking perspective of the 
               entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo. The corpse 
               of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen 
               rope, His posture mimics the Christ figure: His arms thrown 
               wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet 
               of ice. A ghastly still-life, the corpse twisting ever-so-
               slightly on the wind, rope creaking...

               A SAILOR thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the 
               rigging, WIDEN to reveal TWO MORE MEN as they reach out with 
               long gaffing poles to snag the corpse.

               EXT - NEVSKY - LOW ANGLE FROM ICE - TWILIGHT

               Walton watches them reel the body in. ANGLE SHIFTS as he 
               turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to 
               free the ship. Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming 
               into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. The men are near 
               collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. The dogs are 
               nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow. Walton 
               rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice.

                                     WALTON
                         Put your backs into it!

                                     SAILOR #1
                         What's the use? This godless ice 
                         stretches for miles! Would you have 
                         us chow our way back to England?

                                     WALTON
                         No. But we'll chop our way to the 
                         North Pole if we have to. Inch by 
                         bloody inch.

                                     GRIGORI
                         You can't mean to go on! Our journey 
                         is ended! The best we can hope for 
                         now is to get out of this alive!

                                     SAILOR #2
                         Aye, if the ice ever lets us!

                                     WALTON
                         The ice will break. And when it does, 
                         we proceed north... as planned.

               Cries of dismay from the men. Grigori thrusts his arm toward 
               the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast.

                                     GRIGORI
                         At the cost of how many more lives?

               He's interrupted by a long, chilling HOWL. The lead husky 
               rises to its feet, hackles up, HOWLING at some unseen thing 
               in the distance. The other dogs start rising around him, 
               joining in, staring off across the ice.

                                     GRIGORI
                         There's something out there.

               The dogs are going berserk. The lead husky breaks free and 
               launches himself across the ice. The men scramble to restrain 
               the animals, but three more break away and take off after 
               their leader. Walton snatches up his rifle.

                                     WALTON
                         You five come with me! The rest stay 
                         with the ship!

               EXT - ARCTIC PANORAMA - TWILIGHT

               The Nevsky in the distance. The dogs come howling across the 
               ice toward us. The men trail substantially behind.

               BOOM DOWN to the icy boulders f.g. A massive hand comes 
               briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin 
               rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal 
               surgical scars marring the wrist. A HUGE DARK FIGURE wipes 
               frame, fleeing into the rocks. The dogs come bounding past 
               in pursuit, snarling and slavering.

               THE RUNNING MEN hear an INHUMAN HOWL rise amidst those of 
               the dogs. A vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks.

               Barking gives way to shrill squeals. An object is launched 
               from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc.

               Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground 
               with tremendous impact before them...

               ...and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight 
               of the lead dog. Silence now. Those who have fallen, rise.

               Walton cocks his rifle. The group proceeds, picks and axes 
               held ready, slowly skirting the rocks...

               ...and the massacre is revealed. Blood-stained ice. Dead, 
               mangled animals strewn about. One twitching survivor crawls 
               toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its 
               entrails in a red smear.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Look.

               They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, 
               ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague... but one 
               is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross 
               themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the 
               surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its 
               misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. The shot echoes 
               for miles.

                                     WALTON
                         Back to the ship.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

               Silhouetted against the aurora borealis. The horizon swirls 
               mysteriously with color and light. Distant slivers of 
               lightning kiss the earth. Men keep watch in furtive groups, 
               huddled against the cold, breath punching the air with billows 
               of vapor. A massive CRACKLING is heard. A YOUNG SAILOR spins, 
               jumpy.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Only the ice to starboard, boy.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         Is it breaking up?

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Just dancing on the current. It'll 
                         freeze even tighter come next wind.

               CAMERA DRIFTS past to another group:

                                     SAILOR #4
                         It was a polar bear. That's what I 
                         say.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         Say all you want, but you weren't 
                         there. It left human tracks.

                                     SAILOR #6
                         No man could tear those dogs apart.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         No human. We've roused a demon from 
                         the ice.

               CLANG-CLANG! The men spin. A SAILOR on starboard has rung 
               the signal bell. The men race over, crowding the gunwale.

                                     SAILOR
                         Something. In the mist.

               Walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, 
               rifle aimed at the sky. The men wait. Holding their breath. 
               Scanning the darkness.

               AN APPARITION looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe 
               of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. 
               The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor 
               kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side 
               and lolling slowly with the motion of the current.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         It's the demon! Shoot while you've a 
                         chance!

               The Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box 
               spotlight and swings it around. The beam seeks out the specter 
               and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man 
               collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions 
               with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around 
               him.

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               The men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised.

               Grappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged. 
               Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer. Men clasp arms, forming 
               a human chain. Grigori is the first to reach the motionless 
               figure on the dog sled.

                                     WALTON
                         Dead?

               Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the 
               furred hood to search the neck for a pulse...

               ...and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a 
               convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood 
               rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, 
               beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. 
               Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with 
               VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - NIGHT

               A HOWLING WIND has kicked up, pelting the huddled sentries 
               with sleet. CAMERA TRACKS past, moving steadily toward the 
               dimly-glowing window of Walton's cabin...

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               ...where we find Walton and Grigori in tense discussion:

                                     GRIGORI
                         Captain, I implore you. The men are 
                         frightened and angry. They want your 
                         assurance.

                                     WALTON
                         They knew the risks when they signed 
                         on. I've come too far to turn back 
                         now.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Then you run the danger of pushing 
                         them to mutiny.

               Walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on 
               the table before him.

                                     WALTON
                              (low, tight)
                         Let them try.

               Grigori is taken aback. He hears a shifting of blankets and 
               glances to the captain's bed. Walton follows his look.

               Frankenstein has awakened and is watching them.

               Grigori exits, uneasy under Frankenstein's gaze. Walton rises, 
               retrieves a pot from the stove.

                                     WALTON
                         You're awake. I've prepared some 
                         broth. It'll help restore you.

                                     VICTOR
                              (hoarse, faltering)
                         I'm... dying.

               Victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before 
               his face. Fingers skeletal and black.

                                     VICTOR
                         Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple 
                         diagnosis.

                                     WALTON
                         Are you a physician?

                                     VICTOR
                              (faint smile)
                         How is it you come to be here?

                                     WALTON
                         There's a startling question, coming 
                         from you.
                              (beat)
                         I'm captain of this ship. We sailed 
                         from Archangel a month ago, seeking 
                         a passage to the North Pole.

                                     VICTOR
                         Ah. An explorer.

                                     WALTON
                         Would-be. I'm plagued with my share 
                         of difficulties just at the moment.

                                     VICTOR
                         I heard.

                                     WALTON
                         I can't say I blame them. We're 
                         trapped in this ice and bedeviled by 
                         some sort of... creature.

                                     VICTOR
                         Creature? A... human like creature?

                                     WALTON
                              (stunned)
                         You know of it?

                                     VICTOR
                         Your men are right to be afraid.

                                     WALTON
                         Then explain it, whatever it is. It 
                         could save the voyage. I've spent 
                         years planning this. My entire 
                         fortune.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'd persist at the cost of your 
                         own life? The lives of your crew?

                                     WALTON
                         Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge 
                         we gain, the achievements we leave 
                         behind... those live on.

               Victor reaches out with his blackened claw of a hand, pulls 
               him closer. Impassioned, intense:

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you share my madness?

                                     WALTON
                         Madness?

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY on Victor's face...

                                     VICTOR
                         We are kindred, you and I. Men of 
                         ambition. Let me tell you all that I 
                         have lost in such pursuits. I pray 
                         my story will come to mean for you 
                         all that is capricious and evil in 
                         man.

                                     WALTON
                              (angry, frightened)
                         Who are you?

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat)
                         My name is Frankenstein...

               And CAMERA proceeds into the bottomless depths of Victor's 
               staring eye, plunging us into:

               TOTAL DARKNESS. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. A METRONOME fades up 
               before us.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Failure has no pride, Victor. You 
                         must try again.

                                     LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                         Yes, Ma'am.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - DAY

               We hear a HARPSICHORD begin playing as a WIDER ANGLE reveals 
               a huge, magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet 
               high. Floor-to-ceiling windows. Hanging tapestries.

               VICTOR sits at the harpsichord, a very serious 7 year-old in 
               his little gentleman's suit and stiff starched collar.

               MRS. MORITZ, head of the housekeeping staff, conducts the 
               lesson. Her daughter JUSTINE, age 4, sits with her doll in a 
               huge wingback chair, making it dance to the music as she 
               listens... but her eyes are on Victor. She adores him.

               An enormous door swings open. Victor stops playing. His 
               PARENTS enter, ushering a somber and beautiful ELIZABETH, 
               age 6, across the vast expanse of floor. Victor slides off 
               the bench and faces them.

                                     FATHER
                         Mrs. Moritz, would you and your 
                         daughter excuse us?

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along, 
                         Justine. Bring your dolly.

               Mrs. Moritz takes Justine's hand. Justine gazes back at Victor 
               and Elizabeth as her mother whisks her off.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's 
                         coming to live with us.

                                     FATHER
                         She has lost her parents to scarlet 
                         fever. She is an orphan.

                                     MOTHER
                         You must think of her as your own 
                         sister. You must look after her. And 
                         be kind to her.

               Victor stares at Elizabeth. She returns the gaze evenly, 
               self-possessed and dignified even at this young age.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I loved her from the moment that I 
                         first saw her.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - NIGHT

               A MASSIVE BOLT OF LIGHTNING hammers from the sky, reducing a 
               centuries-old oak tree to smoldering ruin...

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               ...while Victor gazes at the storm, face pressed against a 
               window, astonished at the sight.

               Lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by 
                         the storm. Go comfort her.

               INT - UPPER LANDING - NIGHT

               We hear a CHILD SOBBING. Victor comes racing up the grand 
               staircase from below as LIGHTNING sends wild banister shadows 
               skittering. He caroms down the hall toward:

               INT - ELIZABETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor enters. Elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult-
               size bed, gazing up with tear-streaked face at the huge 
               skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary 
               boom and flash. Victor approaches and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't cry, Elizabeth.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (frightened)
                         Aren't you?

               KA-BOOM! A LIGHTNING BOLT rips overhead, rattling the panes 
               of glass. Victor does find it scary... but exhilarating.

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll build a fort. So the lightning 
                         can't get us.

               He races about the room, grabbing every pillow he can find 
               and hurling them to her. Big decorative pillows from the 
               chaise, bed pillows from the armoire... they all come flying. 
               She giggles as a big one knocks her flat. Victor scampers 
               onto the bed with her. They pile the pillows around and above, 
               concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions.

               INSIDE THE PILLOW-FORT

               Victor pokes his hand up, widening a space so they can still 
               see. Lightning glistens in their upturned eyes.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Are you sure it can't hurt us?

                                     VICTOR
                         Nothing can. Not ever.

               She seeks his hand. Fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

               TILT UP to the skylight. Rain drumming the glass...

               INT - MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements 
               stiff and awkward, childlike. MRS. MORITZ is at the 
               harpsichord. Justine sits with her dolly, watching.

                                     MRS. MORITZ

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a 
                         sweeping arc about the room! one- 
                         two-three, twirl-two-three.

               Victor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast 
               room, tripping on each other's toes. They pass within inches 
               of CAMERA, bodies WIPING FRAME...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY (TEN YEARS LATER)

               ...and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from 
               camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he 
               approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful 
               beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... 
                         Excellent! You'll be the envy of all 
                         the young ladies and gentlemen!

               They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor 
               as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't 
               concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws 
               her a look of reproval:

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine. Surely you can maintain 
                         better time than that.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes, Mama.

               Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as 
               Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about 
               the room, their attention only on each other.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the 
               glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor 
               perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension.

               Waiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying 
               to reassure him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She'll be all right.

               Another SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying 
               up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh 
               load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, 
               trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably 
               blocked by Mrs. Moritz.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You can do nothing here. Wait 
                         downstairs.

               He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing 
               and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His 
               father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her.

                                     VICTOR
                         Mother?

                                     FATHER
                         Victor, do as you're told!

               Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She 
               squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He 
               turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror...

               INT - PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, 
               blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth...

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               ...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, 
               the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in 
               the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain.

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               VICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth 
               appears at his side. He doesn't look at her.

                                     VICTOR
                         As a boy, I stood at this window and 
                         watched God destroy our tree.

               b.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up 
               the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more 
               frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A 
               door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's 
               father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward 
               them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue.

                                     VICTOR
                         Father?

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's 
               father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes 
               spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh God. The blood.

               Father sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth 
               race up the stairs and pause before him.

                                     FATHER
                         I did everything I could.

               Victor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry.

               Father gathers them into his arms.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAY

               A BABY CARRIAGE stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic 
               and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace.

               A PRIEST recites a Latin burial mass. DOZENS OF MOURNERS are 
               gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum... an 
               imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its 
               steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix.

               A sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers 
               and sorrow. The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark 
               against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart 
               from the others, staring at the casket. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         How could all my father's knowledge 
                         and skill fail to save her?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's not ours to decide. All that 
                         live must die. It's God's will.

               Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the 
               mausoleum. Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes

                                     VICTOR
                         What kind of God is He to will this?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She was mother to me as well. But 
                         ours is the job of the living. It's 
                         up to us now to hold this family 
                         together. We must think of Father 
                         and be strong for him.
                              (beat)
                         I cannot do that alone.

                                     VICTOR
                         God took her from us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He left a beautiful gift in her place. 
                         A baby boy. To cherish and love as 
                         our very own. Your brother

               Victor glances at the baby carriage. He seeks her hand. Their 
               fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

                                     VICTOR
                         Our brother.

               The baby starts CRYING as the casket is lowered, its thin 
               voice carried on the wind...

               EXT - MEADOW - DAY

               A gorgeous, sun-dappled day. Tall grass waving on the breeze. 
               Butterflies skittering. WILLIAM, 11 months-old, toddles into 
               view. He doesn't get far. PLOP! Down he goes, right on his 
               ass. His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into 
               tears.

               Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and 
               comforting him. Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join 
               them. Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the 
               silverware and food.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Poor William! What indignant tears!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         There, there... shhh...

               Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. The 
               child shrieks and wails, held aloft.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, have a care! You'll make him 
                         dizzy!

                                     VICTOR
                         The world is a dizzying place.

               She tries to reclaim the baby. Victor feints, keeping Willie 
               out of reach. Elizabeth grows crosser:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh, do give him here! He needs to be 
                         comforted and held!

                                     VICTOR
                         He needs to vent his outrage to the 
                         skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! 
                         Learning to walk is not an easy thing! 
                         Why should it be so?

               Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun 
               to laugh. She glares at both of them. Men.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         That's the nature of all progress, 
                         William. Don't let your brother sway 
                         you otherwise.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Quite right!

               Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears. He 
               peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to 
               the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a 
                         feast to be consumed. Women would 
                         have you believe you must walk before 
                         you can run. Or run before you can 
                         waltz!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (laughing)
                         Give me that child before you fill 
                         his head with drivel!

               Victor waltzes the baby in circles. Elizabeth stalks them.

                                     VICTOR
                         Devil take walking, ladies! My brother 
                         shall learn to waltz!

               He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. There's no use 
               resisting. She succumbs and they dance with the baby between 
               them. Justine is gasping with laughter.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Scandalous! What would your dear 
                         mother say?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (thinks a beat)
                         One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-
                         two-three...

               Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around 
               in a sweeping arc. They pass within inches of the CAMERA, 
               bodies wiping frame...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT (6 YEARS LATER)

               To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and 
               spectacle as a HUNDRED DANCERS swirl about the floor in a 
               breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble 
               (NOTE: The music here should be our movie's distinctive 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME, which will reoccur later.)

               Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about 
               them in a blur. Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood.

               Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and 
               intelligence. They're so right for each other, so beautiful 
               together, your heart could break just looking at them.

               Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. She's 
               at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone 
               would ask her to dance. William, now 7, scampers to her side. 
               She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. 
               Waltzing couples swirl past them.

                                     WILLIE
                         Auntie Justine, Papa said I could 
                         have a sweet.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You can. But not before dinner.

               The music ends amidst applause. The men bow to the ladies, 
               the ladies curtsy in return. Victor escorts Elizabeth off 
               the dance floor. Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You dance so beautifully together.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         And you look so lovely.

               They share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. The orchestra 
               recommences. The music is lush. Justine looks hopefully to 
               Victor, keeping her tone light:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor? Spare me one dance?

               Elizabeth catches Victor's eye.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite 
                         out of breath.

               Victor gallantly offers his arm. Justine takes it, lighting 
               up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ...

               ...and they begin to dance. She's glowing. This is a big 
               moment for her. But they've hardly begun, when...

               ...ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne 
               glass with a knife. The dancers stop. The orchestra falls 
               silent. Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass 
               among the guests with glasses of champagne.

                                     FATHER
                         My friends, fatherly pride won't 
                         allow this occasion to pass without 
                         my raising a toast.

               Shouts of assent. Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged 
               forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands.

                                     FATHER
                         To Victor. My son. Who read every 
                         medical book in my library by age 
                         thirteen... and then re-read them, 
                         which seemed excessive even to me.
                              (the guests ROAR with 
                              laughter)
                         Drape yourself in glory, my boy.  
                         Study well.  When you return, you 
                         return a man of medicine. I will 
                         then be honored to call you 
                         "colleague."

                                     VICTOR
                         But never your equal.

                                     FATHER
                         No. You'll surpass me.

               Applause and roars of approval. The drinks are tossed back.

               Victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Music and warm light spill from the windows. A COUPLE eases 
               through a French door and come racing across the lawn, 
               giggling and hushing each other. They take refuge under a 
               tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and 
               Elizabeth. She leans against the trunk to catch her breath.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Smell the air. Wonderful.

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a send-off, isn't it?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Father's so proud.

                                     VICTOR
                         And you?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Prouder still. You'll be the 
                         handsomest student there.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll have to do better than that.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You will.
                              (searches his eyes)
                         What do you want, Victor?

                                     VICTOR
                         To be the best there ever was. To 
                         push our knowledge beyond our 
                         dreams... to eradicate disease and 
                         pestilence... to purge mankind of 
                         ignorance and fear...

               He's so serious, she can't help laugh.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm not mad.

               She smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No. Just very earnest. And very dear.

               An extended moment. Unspoken words flowing between them.

               Victor leans forward and kisses her. Her eyes widen slightly. 
               So do his. Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. 
               They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. He 
               whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         I've loved you all my life

                                     ELIZABETH
                         All my life I've known.

               They kiss again. A breath. A shiver.

                                     VICTOR
                         This feels... incestuous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is that what makes it so delicious?

               She brushes her lips against his. Gentle as a sigh.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister still?

                                     VICTOR
                         I wish to be your husband.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I wish to be your wife.

                                     VICTOR
                         Then come with me to Ingolstadt. 
                         Marry me now.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If only I could. But one of us must 
                         stay. Father's not strong. Willie's 
                         just a child. Who can look after 
                         them in your absence? Who can run 
                         the estate?

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I will be here when you return.

               Another kiss. Turning lustful and steamy. They melt into 
               each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire.

               These people are hot for each other. They stop, stunned at 
               the intensity. He lays his head to her breast. Their fingers 
               clasp. She whispers her secret:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         My head is spinning. I want to give 
                         myself to you.

               He raises his head. She meets his gaze evenly

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If we're to be married, must we wait?

               He touches her face. Fingertips tracing downward, gentle and 
               reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of 
               her bodice. She shivers. Closes her eyes. Lays her hand over 
               his. Guiding his touch.

                                     VICTOR
                         You make me weak.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Not as weak as I.

               She raises his hand to her mouth. Brushing his fingertips 
               with her lips. Wrestling with desire. Their eyes meet.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Our decision. Together.

                                     VICTOR
                         Your decision. For us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (hesitates)
                         I give you my soul...

                                     VICTOR
                              (nods)
                         ...until our wedding night. When our 
                         bodies will join.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor. I love you,

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. My more than sister.

               They kiss again. Gently...

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAWN

               A misty gray dawn. Victor is kneeling at a gravestone, 
               observing a moment of silence. His saddled horse is tethered 
               nearby. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll make you so proud, Mother.

               He lays a small sprig of flowers on the grave, rises and 
               walks toward his horse.

               EXT - MANSION - MORNING

               Overcast and chill. An open carriage stands loaded. The family 
               and household staff have turned out. Victor stands ready to 
               go. Father pulls him into a back-slapping embrace.

                                     FATHER
                         Write to us often.

               Victor moves on to Justine, takes her hand.

                                     VICTOR
                         We never finished our dance.
                              (she smiles)
                         Someday we shall.

               Next is William. The little boy stands stiffly, tears on his 
               face, trying to be brave. Victor kneels and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         The others will look to you while 
                         I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.

               The boy nods miserably, throws his arms around Victor's neck. 
               Last comes Elizabeth. She and Victor regard each other, 
               sharing the secret of last night. A faint smile plays at the 
               corners of her mouth. He kisses her cheek.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               He mounts the carriage. CLAUDE snaps the reins and lurches 
               away, speeding Victor off to his future. Victor turns back 
               for a final look at the home and family he loves so much.

               William runs after him until he's gone from sight...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INGOLSTADT - ESTABLISHING ANGLES - DAY

               High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. Church steeples 
               rising among the rooftops. Beautiful.

               BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               FRAU BRACH trudges heavily up a long, steep, narrow flight 
               of stairs with Victor teetering uneasily behind.

                                     FRAU BRACH
                         No real rooms left. All we've got is 
                         attic space. No one ever wants the 
                         attic space...

               ATTIC SPACE/GARRET - DAY

               She leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted 
               path the entire length of the building; various levels and 
               areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams 
               crisscrossing as understructure to the roof. Daylight filters 
               dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated 
               with grime. Nooks and crannies abound.

                                     VICTOR
                         This will do nicely.

               UNIVERSITY - DAY

               A monumental structure of brick. A BELL TOWER TOLLS. Dead 
               leaves scurry across the lawn.

               LECTURE HALL - DAY

               PROFESSOR KREMPE, a squat little man, paces before the packed 
               galleries of eager young STUDENTS.

                                     KREMPE
                         In science, the letter of fact is 
                         the letter of law. Our pursuit is as 
                         dogmatic as any religious precept. 
                         Think of yourselves as disciples of 
                         a strict and hallowed sect. Someday 
                         you may be priests... but only if 
                         you learn the scripture chapter and 
                         verse.
                              (off their laughter)
                         Any questions?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hand shoots up)
                         But surely, Professor, you don't 
                         intend we disregard the more... 
                         philosophical works.

                                     KREMPE
                         Philosophical?

                                     VICTOR
                         Those which stir the imagination as 
                         well as the intellect. Paracelsus, 
                         for one.

               This reference is lost on all but a few. At the faculty table: 
               PROFESSOR WALDMAN peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses 
               on his nose. Up among the students: HENRY CLERVAL leans out 
               and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction.

               SCHILLER catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes.

                                     KREMPE
                         Paracelsus?

                                     VICTOR
                         Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius 
                         Agrippa...

                                     KREMPE
                         What is your name?

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor Frankenstein, sir.
                              (no response)
                         Of geneva.

                                     KREMPE
                         Of Geneva.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. 
                         Do you wish to study medicine? Or 
                         mysticism?

               Titters sweep the room. Krempe remains staunchly unamused:

                                     KREMPE
                         Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. 
                         Frankenstein's suggested reading 
                         list... thankfully, that would be 
                         most of you... would be well advised 
                         to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we 
                         concern ourselves with immutable 
                         reality...
                              (specific to Victor)
                         ...not the ravings of lunatics and 
                         alchemists hundreds of years in their 
                         graves. Understood?

               Victor is flushed and humiliated. Held like to say more, but 
               wisely swallows his anger and nods.

                                     KREMPE
                         I am relieved. Are there any relevant 
                         questions?
                              (there are none)
                         Lecture hall dismissed.

               EXT - UNIVERSITY - DAY

               Victor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming 
               over the exchange with Krempe. He strides across the lawn, 
               eyes fixed straight ahead.

               Henry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step. 
               Victor glances over. Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been 
               there all along. Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes 
               his straight-ahead demeanor. They walk in silence, just two 
               guys heading in the same direction.

               Henry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself. Victor 
               shoots him a sharp look. Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced 
               with blank innocence. Did somebody snicker?

                                     HENRY
                         I was just clearing my throat.

                                     VICTOR
                         Very well then.

               They continue walking. Silence thick. Finally:

                                     HENRY
                         You know, you're quite mad.

               Victor stops. Turns.

                                     VICTOR
                              (low, measured)
                         I am not mad.

                                     HENRY
                              (matching Victor's 
                              tone)
                         As a march hare.

               Henry's expression betrays nothing... but perhaps there's a 
               trace of amusement in his eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you having me on?

                                     HENRY
                         Of course I am. It pays to humor the 
                         insane.

               Beat. Victor smiles. Henry grins, offers his hand. Takes it.

                                     HENRY
                         Henry Clerval.

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor, Victor Frankenstein.

                                     HENRY
                         I know. You have a way of making an 
                         impression.

               INT - GASTHOF - DUSK

               The tavern is packed with students and noise. Beer and food 
               served at a frantic pace. We find Victor and Henry at a small 
               table, tearing into sausages and cheese.

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you really think I'm mad?

                                     HENRY
                         Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing 
                         you know, you'll be teaching 
                         toadstools to speak.

               Schiller enters with FRIENDS. They pause at Victor's table

                                     SCHILLER
                         If it isn't the sorcerer. Found 
                         yourself an apprentice?

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm afraid I rejected his application. 
                         He merely dabbles.

                                     HENRY
                         Dilettantes need not apply. What 
                         about you? Schiller, isn't it?

                                     SCHILLER
                         Von Schiller. I'm interested in real 
                         medicine. Treating the sick.

                                     HENRY
                         Really? I myself find sick people 
                         rather revolting.
                              (off their looks)
                         I'm here to secure my degree with a 
                         minimum of fuss and hard work that I 
                         might settle into a life of privilege 
                         treating rich old ladies with gout 
                         and dallying with their daughters.

                                     SCHILLER
                         You two disgust me.

               Schiller and his friends stalk off.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT - DUSK

               LONG LENS magnificently compresses buildings and steeples, 
               distant hills and drizzly sky. Victor wears his greatcoat as 
               he and Henry walk along a twisty cobblestone street.

                                     VICTOR
                         Rich old ladies and their daughters?

                                     HENRY
                         Can you think of a better reason?

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a few.

                                     HENRY
                         Do me a favor then...
                              (claps his shoulder)
                         ...keep them to yourself.

               Victor takes a shocked beat and bursts into laughter.

               INT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

               Waldman, in sinock, addresses a GROUP OF STUDENTS from across 
               morgue slab. He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse 
               dissected to reveal the inner workings. The others crowd for 
               a closer look. Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and 
               rolls his eyes in utter disgust.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor sitting at a tall dormer window, 
               writing a letter with quill and ink. It's raining outside. 
               The garret is tidied.

               EXT - RYE FIELDS - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               WORKERS are harvesting for miles around. PAN to Elizabeth 
               and Claude examining the sheaves on a wagon. She cracks the 
               grain and tastes it, glances to Claude. He smiles and nods.

                                     CLAUDE
                         It's turning out to be a good year.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let's return a tenth of the crop to 
                         the tenants.
                              (off his look)
                         They had a hard winter.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Not even your father would be that 
                         generous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Then there's no need to tell him, is 
                         there?

               Claude grins and motions to his MEN. They resume loading the 
               sheaves as a STABLEBOY rides up:

                                     STABLEBOY
                         Miss! The mail arrived! There's one 
                         from Master Victor!

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN PARLOR - NIGHT

               We find the family gathered around the fire as Elizabeth 
               reads Victor's letter aloud:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         ...and not a day goes by that I do 
                         not cherish your faces in my mind's 
                         eye or ache to see you all again. Be 
                         assured that I am with you in spirit, 
                         and you are never far from my 
                         thoughts. I remain, as always, your 
                         loving and devoted Victor. P.S.

               She pauses, reading ahead.

               INSERT OF LETTER

               The P.S. reads: "Elizabeth... I am holding our vow precious 
               in my heart."

               ELIZABETH

               glances up at their expectant faces.

                                     WILLIE
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It says, give Willie an extra big 
                         hug for me.

                                     WILLIAM
                              (beaming)
                         Read it again?

               She smiles, rearranges the pages as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - DAY

               A classroom door. SHOUTING from within:

                                     VICTOR (O.S.)
                         That's no excuse for being a pompous 
                         ass!

               Victor storms out with Krempe at his heels. Krempe pauses in 
               the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him:

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll see you thrown out of this 
                         university! I'll go to the dean 
                         himself! Take me at my word, 
                         Frankenstein! The dean himself!

               Classroom doors are opening, faces peering out. Waldman among 
               them. Victor keeps going, doesn't look back.

               INT - GASTHOF - NIGHT

               Victor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in 
               his thick, well-worn leather journal.

                                     HENRY
                         The entire school heard it. It wasn't 
                         something one could miss.

                                     VICTOR
                         You're a comfort to me, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         What now? Writing about it in your 
                         journal won't help.

                                     VICTOR
                              (quietly)
                         It's a letter to my father.

               Henry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure 
               with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of 
               his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A 
               gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman 
               enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He 
               murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to 
               Victor's table.

                                     VICTOR
                         Professor Waldman.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (takes a seat)
                         Victor, explain yourself.

                                     VICTOR
                         Krempe has a way of provoking my 
                         temper.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You have a way of provoking his.
                              (beat)
                         I've been watching you. You seem 
                         impatient with your studies.

                                     VICTOR
                         To say the least. I came here to 
                         expand my mind, but honest inquiry 
                         seems strangled at every turn. All 
                         we do is cling to the old knowledge 
                         instead of seeking the new.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You disdain accepted wisdom?

                                     VICTOR
                         No, I embrace it... as something to 
                         be used or discarded as we advance 
                         the boundaries of what is known.

                                     HENRY
                              (mutters to Waldman)
                         Now you've got him started.

                                     VICTOR
                         These are exciting times, Henry. 
                         We're entering an era of amazing 
                         breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. 
                         He wasn't content to bleed people 
                         with leeches, he pioneered a new 
                         frontier of thought

                                     HENRY
                         ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox 
                         has been virtually eliminated. I've 
                         heard this speech before.

                                     VICTOR
                         But you haven't listened, Never in 
                         history has so much seemed possible. 
                         We're on the verge of answers undreamt 
                         of... but only if we have the courage 
                         to ask the questions.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I understand your frustration. I was 
                         young once myself.
                              (beat)
                         Walk me home. Something I'd like to 
                         show you.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               The gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor 
               and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to 
               big windows where the light would be best during the day. 
               Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of 
               subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, 
               all quite excellent.

               The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter 
               with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up 
               his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of 
               tables crammed with experiments and clutter.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You know for thousands of years the 
                         Chinese have based their medical 
                         science on the belief that the human 
                         body is a chemical engine run by 
                         electricity? They say we all contain 
                         streams of energy which flow through 
                         us like currents in the ocean, or 
                         rivers in the earth.

               They arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of 
               knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Their doctors treat patients by 
                         inserting needles like these into 
                         the flesh at various key points to 
                         manipulate these electric streams.

               He directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the 
               wall. It depicts the human body from front and side angles.

               Acupuncture points are clearly marked.

                         Preposterous.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I once saw it done, as a boy in 
                         Canton. My parents were missionaries. 
                         The cure was nothing short of 
                         miraculous.
                              (off their looks)
                         I've never forgotten it. Been 
                         fascinated ever since.

                                     HENRY
                         It smacks of magic.

               Waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal 
               an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins 
               trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in 
               turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries.

               Waldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as 
               the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as 
               Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet 
               flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?

               Waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm 
               at the array of wires and batteries.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Electricity.

                         It's utterly fantastic! This is the 
                         sort of thing I'm talking about! We 
                         should be learning this!

                                     WALDMAN
                         Why? God alone knows what it means. 
                         Until it has proven value, it's 
                         nothing more than a ghoulish parlor 
                         trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

                                     VICTOR
                         But the possibilities. Combining 
                         ancient knowledge with new? Something 
                         like this could change our fundamental 
                         views!

                         It is a thrilling direction to 
                         explore. Thrilling and dangerous.
                              (off his look)
                         Nature can be wonderful and terrible. 
                         Science is not a realm for the 
                         reckless; it needs a conscience. We 
                         must proceed cautiously. Assess as 
                         we go.
                              (drapes the toad)
                         What I do on my own time is my own 
                         business. The same holds true for 
                         you. You wish to expand your mind?

                         I doubt that decision is still mine 
                         to make.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (waves)
                         Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an 
                         apology to Professor Krempe...

               Victor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a 
               stern gesture for silence. Listen.

                                     WALDMAN
                         "...a sincere and heartfelt apology 
                         which you will then read aloud to 
                         him before the assembled student 
                         body and faculty.

                                     VICTOR
                         Why?

                                     WALDMAN
                              (draws close)
                         Our profession needs talent like 
                         yours. Destroy your career over an 
                         issue of pride? What a waste.

               Waldman hands him the acupuncture needle. A gift. Victor 
               studies it, fascinated.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Go home, Victor. Write the letter,

                         him was both rash and inexcusable.

               Up in the gallery, Krempe nods grudgingly to himself.

               guests. KITCHEN STAFF are to-ing and fro-ing. Elizabeth splits 
               her attention between supervising and reading Victor's letter, 
               while Justine busies herself with a flower arrangement. Willie 
               gets underfoot. Father just sits.

               Waldman leans close to observe. Softly:

                                     WALDMAN
                         Re-configure the leads?

               With Waldman at his side and Henry providing the tools as 
               needed, Victor instructs a freshman class in the internal 
               workings of a dissected corpse. Professor Krempe observes 
               from a distance.

                                     VICTOR
                         ...and the medulla oblongata is the

                         We'll resume your torture tomorrow.

               He waves them dismissed. They laugh and exit, relieved.

               Waldman squeezes Victor's elbow. Well done. Victor stiffens 
               at Krempe's approach.

                                     KREMPE
                         You seem to be adapting well to the 
                         approved curriculum.

                         Despite the lack of challenge.

               Krempe reddens, but says nothing. He gives Waldman a curt 
               nod and walks off.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

                                     VICTOR
                         The strain was evident.

                                     HENRY
                         Come now, you must take some 
                         satisfaction. You've risen to the 
                         top of your class. A position of 
                         prominence and regard.

               Victor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles.

                                     VICTOR
                         What keeps me going are my friends.

               He throws his arm around Henry's neck, pulls him into an 
               affectionate headlock. Henry struggles and laughs:

                                     HENRY

               Victor is gazing with reverence at a gorgeous oval locket 
               dangled before him by a smiling JEWELER. He glances to Henry 
               for an opinion.

                                     HENRY
                         Your Elizabeth must be quite a 
                         treasure, Victor
                              (pointedly to jeweler)
                         ...to justify these prices.

               The jeweler's smile goes frosty.

               WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               TIGHT ANGLE ON the locket lying open against canvas, dangling 
               from an easel frame. TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent 
               miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than 
               three inches high within its penciled oval.

               Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, 
               jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally 
               large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently 
               for the portrait, suffused with daylight.

               Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. 
               Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly 
               hates people looking over his shoulder.

                                     HENRY
                              (deadpan)
                         Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?

               Waldman heaves a long-suffering sigh. He abruptly jabs his 
               brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint. Dignity upheld 
               he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains 
               of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's 
               company. Cigars are lit, wine is flowing. Conversation is 
               fast and loose, intense and passionate:

                         I'm quite serious. Look at all the 
                         charity and clinic work we do. Up 
                         until thirty years ago, the concept 
                         of vaccine was unheard of.

                                     HENRY
                         You're saying all disease will 
                         eventually be eradicated?

                                     WALDMAN
                         I'm convinced. Not by treating 
                         symptoms, but by diving nature's 
                         most jealously-guarded secrets.

                                     HENRY
                              (turning serious)
                         Do you foresee this happening in our 
                         lifetimes?

                                     WALDMAN
                         No. But someday.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.

               A HOWL OF OUTRAGE AND LAUGHTER. Victor flings his napkin in 
               Henry's face.

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you would think of that!

                                     HENRY
                              (laughing)
                         Somebody has to!

               Victor raises his wine glass. The others join. A toast.

                                     VICTOR
                         I tell you what we need, my friends. 
                         Forget the symptoms and diseases. 
                         What we need is a vaccine for death 
                         itself.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (laughter)
                         Oh, now you have gone too far. There's 
                         only one God, Victor.

                                     HENRY
                              (raises his glass)
                         And here's to Him. Everything in 
                         moderation, Frankenstein.

                                     VICTOR
                              (grins)
                         Nothing in moderation, Clerval.

               INT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               CAMERA, TRACKS the gritty reality of a big-city poor house, 
               crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, 
               wailing babies, stampeding children. Absolutely jangling 
               with noise and confusion... loud and stifling... people 
               getting eye-ear-nose-throat exams... being vaccinated...

               The "doctors" in attendance are all Ingolstadt STUDENTS 
               performing community service, none of whom look like they're 
               enjoying it. Schiller looks particularly harried. We find 
               Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations. They keep glancing 
               over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled 
               in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified 
               about getting his vaccination:

                                     MAN
                         Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox 
                         in it, I hear tell!

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Pox? They givin' us pox?

               Ripples of panic spread. Waldman is as tense and clipped as 
               we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper 
               amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue:

                                     WALDMAN
                         No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Vaca-what?

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, 
                         meaning cow
                              (glances at her girth)
                         ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...

                                     MAN
                         I told you there was pox in it!

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...no, no, cowpox in a minute 
                         quantity, perfectly harmless, gives 
                         you a natural immunity to small ox, 
                         which is the point of this whole 
                         bloody exercise...

               Victor and Henry are pausing work. Concerned. Drifting closer. 
               The ferret-faced man is cornered.

                                     MAN
                         You doctors kill people! I don' care 
                         what you say, you ain't stickin' it 
                         in me!

                                     WALDMAN
                         I most assuredly am! It prevents 
                         disease and it's the law! Why am I 
                         explaining myself? Somebody restrain 
                         this damn fool!

               It happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as 
               the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he 
               darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry. Victor looks 
               after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. 
               He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. 
               Puzzled. It still hasn't really dawned.

               Waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed 
               to his sternum, lips tight. He looks more annoyed than 
               anything else. He exhales slowly.

                                     HENRY
                         Professor?

                                     WALDMAN
                              (softly)
                         Oh God.

               That's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. 
               They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls 
               to the floor. People are pushing and crowding to see.

               EXT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               A cobblestoned street-scene. Carriage. A delivery wagon. 
               Vendors. Pedestrians. The doors of the poor house burst open, 
               releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying 
               Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running 
               alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at 
               their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians 
               scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, 
               bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for 
               help...

               INT - UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - DAY

               Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket. The chapel 
               is full. Victor is seated near the back. Dazed. Henry comes 
               up the aisle and slides in next to him. Victor doesn't even 
               glance over. Henry whispers:

                                     HENRY
                         They just caught the man who did it.

                                     VICTOR
                         He was a frightened soul who acted 
                         out of fear and ignorance.

                                     HENRY
                         They'll hang him all the same.

                                     VICTOR
                         Good. I'll be there to hear his 
                         worthless neck snap.

               People glance back. Henry lays his hand on Victor's elbow.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep your voice down. You don't know 
                         what you're saying.

                                     VICTOR
                         It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't 
                         have happened! The bastard deserves 
                         to die.

               Victor is causing ripples of attention throughout the chapel. 
               Even Krempe falters briefly in his eulogy. Henry pulls Victor 
               from the pew, drags him up the aisle...

               INT - CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY

               ...and into the confessional where they launch at each other 
               in harsh whispers.

               Dialogue here is overlapping and intense:

                                     HENRY
                         You're making a scene!

                                     VICTOR
                         Why Waldman? He of all people should 
                         have cheated death!

                                     HENRY
                         You can't. Death is God's will!

                                     VICTOR
                         I resent God's monopoly.

                                     HENRY
                         That's blasphemy!

                                     VICTOR
                         Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent 
                         his life trying to help people!

                                     HENRY
                         All the more reason for us to continue 
                         his work with the poor!

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat, low)
                         No. He had more important work.

                                     HENRY
                         There are sick people who need our 
                         help. Here and now. Not in some future 
                         time. Consider that.

               Henry exits. Victor tries to compose himself, clasping his 
               hands together as if in prayer... or quiet rage. He gazes 
               up. There on the wall hangs a crucifix.

                                     VICTOR
                         Life and death.
                              (beat)
                         Why should You alone have the final 
                         say?

               VICTOR'S POV PUSHING SLOWLY IN on the Christ figure before 
               him, bleeding from a crown of thorns, arms thrown wide.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DA VINCI'S STUDY OF MAN rises from the image of Christ, 
               striking an eerily similar pose, arms thrown wide within the 
               perfect circle. We hear a DOOR BEING UNLOCKED as...

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               ...a WIDER ANGLE reveals the deserted workshop. The door 
               swings open as Victor lets himself in. He sees the finished 
               locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the 
               beautiful miniature portrait it contains. Snaps it shut.

               He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on 
               the wall. He stares. Intense.

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               TRACKING SHOT: Things are in the process of being sorted and 
               boxed. We find Victor poring over Waldman's notes:

                                     VICTOR
                         To understand the causes of life, we 
                         must first have recourse to death... 
                         and examine the process in minutest 
                         detail...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A gray day. Waldman's ferret-faced MURDERER stands weeping 
               helplessly on the scaffold as sentence is read:

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         ...his body to be left on public 
                         display for a twenty-four hour period, 
                         thereafter to be consigned to an 
                         unmarked pauper's grave. So the court 
                         has spoken.

               The EXECUTIONER draws the hood over the murderer's head, 
               cinches the noose tight. The condemned man is blubbering, 
               pleading for his life.

               Victor stands in the crowd. Watching. Waiting. We hear the 
               THUMP of the body dropping, the CRACK of a snapping neck...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               Dark as Hades. Pissing down rain. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and a 
               CRASH OF THUNDER. The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, 
               lashed by the wind.

               Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of 
               his greatcoat. He pulls out a thin, glittering blade. The 
               very weapon which took Waldman's life. He gazes up at the 
               dead man... at the rope from which he dangles...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab. Victor leans 
               close, still dripping, studying the face closely. A FLASH OF 
               LIGHTNING throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer 
               windows and skylights. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         No longer pathetic and useless

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               The dead man, dissected and wired, jerks bolt upright, 
               flopping and convulsing, eyes opening and closing, mouth 
               gaping open and shut. He falls back limply as Victor shuts 
               the power off, making careful notations in his journal.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               TRACKING the dissection table... up the length of the 
               murderer's body... now in an advanced stage of decay... we 
               hear the SOFT BUZZING of flies...

               We find Victor standing over the corpse. Gaunt and hollow- 
               eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. 
               Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are 
               swarming in the flesh. He abruptly raises a cleaver and WHACKS 
               it off at the elbow.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING SLOWLY past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we 
               find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis. Dead 
               tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a 
               slow-burning flame. Victor smears a glass slide, places it 
               under a microscope.

               INT - GASTHOF - DAY

               Victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, 
               scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. 
               Henry is across from him:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor. This has got to stop.
                              (Victor glances up)
                         Nobody's seen you in months. You 
                         haven't attended a single class.

                                     VICTOR
                         I've been preoccupied.

                                     HENRY
                         We all know how hard you took 
                         Waldman's death. Even Krempe is 
                         sympathetic. But it is time to move 
                         on. It is time to concern yourself 
                         with life.

                                     VICTOR
                         That is my concern.
                              (faint smile)
                         I'm involved in something just now. 
                         I want to finish it in Waldman's 
                         memory.

                                     HENRY
                         How much longer?

                                     VICTOR
                         Few months perhaps. I'm gathering 
                         the raw materials even now.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               The wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open.

               CAMERA PUSHES through to find Victor standing inside over a 
               stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands. He's nervous, 
               working up his courage:

                                     VICTOR
                         Materials. That's all they are Tissue 
                         to be re-used.

               He pries off the stone lid. It THUMPS heavily to the floor, 
               cracking in half. He opens the casket, reaches in, raises 
               the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Stone monuments. Bare trees. Ivy-covered ground. Victor 
               shoulder-deep in a grave. Shoveling. A lamp burns low.

               COFFIN - NIGHT

               Pitch black. The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. 
               Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING ALONG the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde 
               jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional 
               head staring through the glass, dead cats...

               ...and we find Victor working into the wee hours. Hunched 
               over his specimens. Candle flame flickering low. Referring 
               back to Waldman's notes. Making notations in arcane books 
               such as "De Occulta Philosophia," by Agrippa, and "Le Sciences 
               et les arts D'alchimiste," by Paracelsus.

               FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               A magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue 
               sky. TILT DOWN to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion 
               distant. A steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth 
               regards a stack of mail.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Nothing. Still nothing.

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's been months. It's not like him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Something's wrong. I know it.
                              (off her look)
                         I've heard rumors of cholera spreading 
                         south from Hamburg.

                                     JUSTINE
                         So have I

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I should go. I should leave today.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into 
                         Germany would be banned. You'd never 
                         get near Ingolstadt.
                              (beat)
                         Besides, they're only rumors.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (beat, nods)
                         And not a word of them to Father. 
                         He's agitated enough not hearing 
                         from Victor.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Read him one of the old letters and 
                         rephrase it. We'll say it came today. 
                         It'll set his mind at ease.

               Elizabeth gives her a hug. They walk toward the mansion

               INT - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Murky and dark. Bellows are pumping. Showers of sparks 
               cascade. The BLACKSMITH and his ASSISTANT are pounding a 
               metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet 
               into shape. Victor enters. The blacksmith directs his 
               attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the 
               wall. Victor runs his hand over the surface. Nice.

               INT - MATERNITY WARD - CHARITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               A WOMAN lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. 
               Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. One of the 
               ASSISTANTS snatches it up, scurries around the corner. Victor 
               is waiting in the shadows. Money changes hands.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor is examining the amniotic fluid. Boiling it off. 
               Working to synthesize it.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be 
               a large copper vat. He dips his hand in, examines the 
               consistency and smell. ANGLE WIDENS, spinning slowly up to 
               reveal that the vat is human in shape. A sarcophagus.

               EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               We find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, 
               checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. A PAIR OF MEN 
               lurk in the shadows, waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                         That one.

               The corpse is lifted off. Money changes hands.

                                     MAN
                         With this cholera come to town, we'll 
                         have plenty more for you.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor wearing elbow-length gloves, hacking furiously away 
               with a bone saw. Tossing aside the scraps.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor has an arm wired, testing reactions. He scrapes off a 
               small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break 
               apart. It doesn't look good. He glances feverishly at the 
               clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Not optimal. Must use. No time to 
                         replace. Body can't wait.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor stitches a torso with one of those big, awful curved 
               needles, yanking up hard to draw the catgut tight.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I stitched it together with my own 
                         hands...

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via 
               block-and-tackle mounted on a ceiling track. The body rises 
               limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, 
               long black hair covering its face.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         A patchwork man of my own devising.

               Victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning.

               He pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along 
               its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The Creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded 
               by shadows and clutter, draped/sprawled like Christ taken 
               from the cross in Michelangelo's "Pieta."

               Beakers bubbling and dripping. Intravenous lines seeping and 
               secreting. A misty chemical haze in the air.  Victor is 
               watching his patchwork man. Glowering. Waiting.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         It took nutrients like a child 
                         receiving milk... blushed like a 
                         young girl with the blood I forced 
                         through its veins...

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips through the skylights, bathing the 
               scene purple/white. Eerier and eerier.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         ...all in preparation.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               We find Victor passed out in a chair. His creation is still 
               taking fluids. Gray daylight streams through the windows.

               There's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' 
               hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or 
               wail. Victor doesn't stir. Dead to the world. Somebody starts 
               POUNDING on the door. Victor rouses, takes a moment to 
               remember where he is. He lurches from his chair, grabs a 
               canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man."

               STAIRWELL - DAY

               Henry is pounding. Finally the latch is drawn. The door swings 
               open a crack. Victor peers out. Gaunt and furtive. Suspicious. 
               Henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance.

                                     HENRY
                         God's sake, what is that stench?

               Henry peers past him.

               Victor shifts, blocking his view

                                     VICTOR
                         This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy 
                         just now. What do you want?

                                     HENRY
                         Things have gone worse with this 
                         cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases 
                         a day now. Classes have been 
                         suspended. University's shut down.

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes? And?

                                     HENRY
                         Listen to what I'm saying. The 
                         militia's arriving to quarantine the 
                         city. Most of us are getting out 
                         while we still can.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'll be leaving then.
                              (beat)
                         Just as well. You never were cut out 
                         for this, Henry. Goodbye.

               And the door slams shut. The bolt is thrown. Henry pounds.

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO 
                         REASON!

               Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and 
               heads back down the stairs.

               EXT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - STREET - DAY

               Henry exits into a nightmare. REFUGEES are streaming from 
               the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their 
               possessions. Henry steps into the street and is nearly run 
               down by a carriage.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         OUT OF THE WAY!

               Henry glances up to see Schiller at the reins, struggling to 
               control the animals as the carriage eases past.

                                     HENRY
                         Schiller? You're leaving? Where's 
                         all that high talk about treating 
                         the sick?

                                     SCHILLER
                              (icy)
                         To hell with them. And you.

               He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down. The carriage 
               lurches away, scattering refugees before it.

               Henry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking 
               around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like 
               cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry 
               stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned 
               at the human suffering around him as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Time running out. Rate of decay 
                         accelerating. Must strike now... or 
                         start again from scratch.

               He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab 
               before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length 
               steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling 
               above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped 
               with glittering needles big enough to knit with.

               Victor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been 
               daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips 
               a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing 
               identical marks on the body before him...

               Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these 
               spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good 
               contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage...

               Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners 
               of the steel grate...

               Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig 
               into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, 
               wires and all...

               HIGH WIDE ANGLE

               ...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's 
               gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature 
               dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length 
               and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick 
               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and 
               neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, 
               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary 
               slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous 
               array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. 

               Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward 
               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly 
               above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all 
               unlike the Da Vinci...

               And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it 
               spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding 
               in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it 
               along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after 
               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING 
               BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and 
               sinister shadows...

               ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper 
               sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He 
               positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature 
               down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the 
               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.

               Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, 
               unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- 
               tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, 
               grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also 
               suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with 
               reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he 
               swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place 
               with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, 
               spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the 
               sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster.

               The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, 
               zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear:

               Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking 
               the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble.

               Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes 
               checking on his creation drifting in the murk.

               Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, 
               supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they 
               send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables 
               along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge.

               Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING 
               painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. 
               Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle.

               Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive.

               The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first 
               jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with 
               energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through 
               the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking.

               Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, 
               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on 
               a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam 
               wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.

               He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going 
               knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- 
               tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. 
               And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this 
               twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, 
               with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming 
               phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, 
               wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...

               EEL POV (IN THE TUBE)

               ...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster 
               and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the 
               creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless 
               gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. 
               The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to 
               side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open 
               and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges.

               Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, 
               watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.

                                     VICTOR
                              (muffled through the 
                              glass)
                         Live, you bastard!

               A huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing 
               and spasming against the glass.

               FRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are 
               scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting 
               the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp 
               and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off.

               FRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation 
               has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly 
               devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing.

               It was all for nothing...

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its 
               mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries 
               to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid.

               FRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his 
               hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he 
               imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another.

               We see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation.

               Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's alive. It's alive.

               And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the 
               sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- 
               THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the 
               inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the 
               wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning 
               man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope 
               to hoist the lid away...

               ...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled 
               from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper 
               shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, 
               demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and 
               thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry 
               and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying.

               Silence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling 
               surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity 
               passes in the space of a heartbeat.

               The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, 
               thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all 
               directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, 
               trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding 
               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging 
               Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with 
               electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying 
               to break the Creature's grip...

               ...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling 
               as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, 
               washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body 
               tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping 
               electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, 
               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking 
               his legs away. He finds his traction and scrambles to his 
               feet.

               The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him. Flopping 
               and jerking. Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting 
               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the 
               fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.

               VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring 
               down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife 
               to this ghastly birth. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         What have I done?

               The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching 
               his clothes, pawing him.

                                     VICTOR
                         LET GO OF ME!

               Victor can't break free. Panicking. He snatches a hammer 
               from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's 
               head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding 
               it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding 
               down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and 
               jerking in its own afterbirth.

               Silence now.

               A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined 
               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a 
               dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, 
               jerking wild shadows across the walls.

               Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. 
               It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:

                                     VICTOR
                         Massive birth defects. Result is 
                         malfunctional and vile.
                              (beat)
                         Have chosen to abort.

               He walks stiffly away, disappears into the bedroom...

               INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...where he staggers to the canopied bed, beyond exhausted, 
               and collapses face-down into oblivion. Weeping.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The wee hours. Rain pattering desolately on the roof. Victor 
               sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. Through a crack in 
               the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, 
               throwing a twisted spill of light. A shadow appears.

               Entering. Shambling and gliding across the floor. Silent and 
               furtive. Creeping toward the bed.

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Moving into close-up. Sleeping.

               Unaware. The shadow falls across his face. Beat. His eyes 
               fly open. An intake of breath. Paralyzed.

               Sensing the presence. Feeling the shadow. Working himself up 
               to something. Perhaps a scream. He can stand it no longer, 
               thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside...

               ...and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death. 
               Naked. Beseeching. Dull yellow eyes trying to understand. 
               Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase CRASHING 
               to the floor. The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening 
               to cut off his path to the door.

                                     VICTOR
                         Stay away!

               He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab. The 
               Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows 
               him with surprising speed.

               INT - LAB - NIGHT

               Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling 
               behind, trying to catch up. Victor hurling lab equipment, 
               tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down.

               Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the 
               Creature's face. The Creature presses against the wood with 
               pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone.

               He sinks to the floor. Abandoned. Shivering with cold. Sees 
               Victor's greatcoat where it fell. Grabs it. Drags it over. 
               Shrouding himself.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races into the downpour, soaked to the skin in seconds, 
               mind racing. He needs a plan. He presses on.

               INT - SHOP - NIGHT

               Victor appears at the window. TILT DOWN to reveal an array 
               of gleaming swords lying in their velvet display. Victor 
               hurls a brick through the glass. Snatches up a sword.

               INT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               Victor careens in from the storm, drenched, racing up the 
               stairs, sword glittering in his grasp. He gets to the top of 
               the stairs...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               ...only to discover the door torn off it's hinges. He enters, 
               stunned. The thing is gone.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races back into the storm. Searching. Slogging grimly 
               on. Lashed by the wind and rain. Mocked by the lightning. 
               He'll never give up. Not until he finds the thing and takes 
               back the life he gave it. He dwindles from view, vanishing 
               into the gale as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT - ALLEY - MORNING

               Gray and drizzly. Heaps of wet garbage. Crawling rats. There's 
               a shifting, heaving motion. The vermin scatter as the waking 
               Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like 
               a frightened child peering from under a blanket. Lost and 
               confused.

               He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat. He 
               finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously. Ravenous.

               TWO FERAL DOGS appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters 
               and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes. Watching him 
               eat. Assessing his potential as a threat. The Creature stares 
               ingenuously back. Not knowing to be afraid.

               The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural SNARL. The 
               Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN. That's all 
               it takes. The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the 
               food torn from his hands. The dogs dart away, growling and 
               fighting over the scrap.

               The Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his 
               feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and 
               pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar 
               against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out 
                         your deeeaaad!

               A death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, 
               DRIVER ringing his bell. It makes no sense to the Creature, 
               but it's a sign of human life. He presses on...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               ...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a 
               fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, 
               though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still 
               trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling 
               out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, 
               unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People 
               trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little 
               attention.

               The Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to 
               a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches 
               down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing.

               It's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Here! What do you think you're doing?

               The Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's 
               reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him.

               Mouth gaping. Too stunned to scream.

               The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's 
               going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience 
               with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: 
               he curls his lips back and snarls.

               He's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps 
               back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman 
               SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away...

               ...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes 
               sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his 
               loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A 
               ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright...

                                     ROUGH MAN
                         Stupid bastard!

               ...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, 
               whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. 
               Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified 
               faces on all sides...

               He's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague!

               ...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. 
               Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning 
               him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround 
               him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, 
               whimpering for them to stop.

                                     VENDOR'S WIFE
                         BURN HIM! BURN HIM!

               The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling 
               back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob 
               sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He 
               gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, 
               scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's 
               wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men 
               start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A 
               torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat.

               The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete 
               bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, 
               bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He 
               breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat 
               billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, 
               hurling rocks and sticks.

               EXT - STREETS/ALLEYS - DAY

               The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many 
               cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a 
               wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. 
               They'll be here any second.

               He sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up 
               on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. 
               The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death 
               cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, 
               gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their 
               seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we

               EXT - STREET - DAY

               Elsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This 
               part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, 
               stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, 
               quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among 
               them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks.

               WORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking 
               them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy 
               burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the 
               wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The 
               worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder:

                                     WORKER #1
                         Over here!

               WORKER #2 hurries over. Stares down. Eyes also widening.

                                     WORKER #2
                         Oh my God.

               Worker #1 rips his mask away. It's Henry. He leans down and 
               grabs Victor, trying to rouse him.

                                     HENRY
                         Victor! 

               Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside. Professor Krempe.

                                     KREMPE
                         Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! 
                         Lift on three! One, two, three!

               They hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and 
               carry him into the street. Victor rouses, feels himself being 
               carried. He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with 
               heaps of reeking dead. Staring. Waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                              (delirious, struggling)
                         No... no... I'm not dead... please... 
                         Don't put me on the cart! I'm not 
                         dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!

               ANGLE WIDENS UP as they carry him kicking and screaming past 
               the death cart and on across the square...

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT - MASS CEMETERY - DAY

               A death cart rattles past, bearing its load. PAN WITH IT to 
               reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead 
               are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke 
               is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is 
               drifting like black snow.  BODIES  are dumped into a slit- 
               trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked 
               over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking.

               One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The 
               Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of 
               oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering 
               over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, 
               loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...

               ON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH

               ...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward 
               the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature 
               erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, 
               The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering 
               back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes 
               spinning over his head into the trench.

               WA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The 
               Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up 
               in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, 
               running from this ghastly place of flames and death...

               The Creature comes blundering into view. On the move. He 
               knows not where. Just away, He arrives at a pond. Water.

               He's thirsty. He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping 
               it up with his hands. He pauses, noticing his broken 
               reflection. The water settles and his face comes clearly 
               into view. He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at 
               his own reflection...

               ...and then he realizes it's him down there. He stirs the 
               water with his fingertips to make sure. He reaches up, 
               touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it...

               ...and utterly heartbroken. He drops his face into his hand 
               and weeps helplessly. BARKING DOGS in the distance. He looks 
               up, thinking they're after him. A moan of grief. He pushes 
               to his feet.

               TRACKING THE CREATURE  faster and faster through the trees, 
               running from this world he's been born into. Gasping for 
               breath. Crashing through branches.

               The BARKING draws closer. He hurls himself into a thicket, 
               scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. 
               Panic. Exhaustion. Mortal terror. He flinches as something 
               comes CRASHING through the brush nearby. The legs of a DOE 
               come into view. Staggering. Falling. Thrashing down into a 
               cushion of dead leaves. Two arrows protrude from her heaving 
               side.

               A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, 
               frothing with exhaustion and terror. Waiting for his mother 
               to rise. Her thrashing grows weaker. Dying.

               The Creature moans at the sight. The fawn turns, meets his 
               gaze. An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature 
               reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. 
               The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting. The Creature's 
               fingertips make contact with the fawn...

               A pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've 
               ever seen throw themselves HOWLING AND SNARLING onto the 
               doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets 
               out a SHRIEK, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, 
               crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his 
               chest. The dogs take off after him.

               DOLLYING THE CREATURE

               Running full-tilt, SHRIEKING in terror all the way. Trying 
               to save the fawn. Trying to save himself. The dogs are 
               snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and 
               bring him down. He hears RUSHING WATER ahead, crashes headlong 
               through a thicket...

               EXT - RIVER - DAY

               ...and sails SCREAMING into empty SPACE, twisting and spinning 
               as he falls, plummeting head-first into the rapids. The dogs 
               are left behind. The Creature gets swept along, gasping and 
               choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched 
               protectively to his chest.

               Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out 
               and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over 
               the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his 
               knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the 
               fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to 
               realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands. 
               He crushed it to death trying to save it. He lays it down, 
               moaning, trying to understand. ANGLE WIDENS UP into the trees 
               as we

               WOODS - DUSK

               TILT DOWN to reveal a solitary figure in a greatcoat trudging 
               across the sodden countryside under a dismal, darkening sky. 
               Cold. Hungry. Wet. Tired.

               The Creature pauses, hearing FAINT MUSIC drifting on the 
               breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder. He slogs 
               to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley 
               below. A peasant dwelling. Smoke drifts from the chimney. 
               That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive 
               rendition of our movie's WALTZ/LOVE THEME).

               The Creature proceeds down the ridge... drawn by the music 
               and the promise of warmth.

               HOUSE - DAY

               The Creature approaches cautiously. Furtive. He eases to a 
               window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. Listening. The 
               tune ends. We hear the pleasant murmur of VOICES. FOOTSTEPS 
               come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and 
               dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and 
               swings open. FELIX exits, a poor man trying to scratch an 
               honest living from the soil. He heads in the same direction 
               as the Creature...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               ...and walks around the corner of the house just as the 
               Creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops. The 
               Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches 
               and stops, only his legs visible. Feed is scattered through 
               the wire. The chickens begins to eat. The Creature backs up

               PIGSTY - DUSK

               ...and finds himself in the company of PIGS. The animals 
               GRUNT and SQUEAL in alarm.

                                     FELIX (O.S.)
                         Yes, yes, I'm coming...

               The Creature scurries further back into the shadows as Felix's 
               feet stop just outside. A pail is upended. Slop pours into 
               the trough. Felix walks away. The pigs scurry to eat. The 
               Creature leans forward intently. Food?

               He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They 
               jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. 
               He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his 
               chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.

               He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward 
               the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest 
               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. He 
               places his eye to a chink between the logs...

               ...and sees GRANDFATHER playing the instrument near a 
               fireplace of glowing embers. The Creature shifts for another 
               view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. Felix 
               and his wife MARIE are helped by their children, MAGGIE AND 
               THOMAS, ages 6 and 8

                                     MARIE
                         Bring Grandfather to the table.

               The old man stops playing as the children scurry over. As 
               Maggie helps him to his feet, Thomas tosses another log on 
               the fire. It BLAZES UP. Fire and sparks. In the pigsty, the 
               Creature draws back with a fearful moan...

               ...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze 
               blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering 
               what it might have been. Probably nothing. He lets the 
               children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from 
               the stove and ladled out.

               The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling 
               it from here. A string of drool spills from his mouth. It's 
               humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast 
               compared to pig slop...

               Victor lies sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. In an 
               eerie echo of before: the door creaks open in a spill of 
               light. A shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his 
               face. Victor's eyes fly open. He tries to erupt from bed, 
               choking on a scream... and Henry wrestles him back to the 
               pillow to feel his clammy forehead.

               Victor pauses, too emotional to respond. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I want to go home.

               Beat.

               Henry accepts this, though he doesn't like it.

                                     HENRY
                         It'll be months before you're well 
                         enough. Meantime, your family must 
                         be frantic not hearing from you.

               Henry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand.

                                     HENRY
                         I found these. Some of the postmarks 
                         go back nine months.
                              (slaps them on the 
                              bed)
                         Why don't you open them? And when 
                         you've the strength, have the decency 
                         to ease their minds with a reply. 
                         Soon as the city ends quarantine, 
                         I'll even mail it for you. Along 
                         with this.
                              (raises the locket)
                         It's a beautiful gift. Does her no 
                         good lying here.

               Henry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt. Victor is 
               swept with emotion and remorse. He closes his eyes. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It can't survive.

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               The Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. He rouses, 
               scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. Felix is 
               returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his 
               back. The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see 
               Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie. A 
               pathetic array of potatoes and turnips.

                                     FELIX
                         Not much to look at. Even less to 
                         eat. I don't how we're going to get 
                         through the winter with this yield.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll sell another pig at market.

                                     FELIX
                         One less for us.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll make do. We always have.

               He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. She moves to comfort 
               him, cradling his head to her breast. He returns her embrace, 
               drawing strength. A tender, gentle moment. The Creature 
               watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. 
               Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes.

                                     FELIX
                         I'll see if I can scratch a few more 
                         out of the ground.

               He hoists the basket and exits. The Creature turns to watch 
               Felix trudging back toward the fields.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               Felix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes. Back-breaking 
               work. Thomas provides what help he can. Some distance away, 
               Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow. ANGLE SHIFTS to 
               reveal the Creature watching from the brambles...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family eat their dinner. Potatoes 
               and turnips. A glimmer of understanding in his eyes.

               EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

               A long shadow looms toward the dwelling... circling the 
               house... approaching the shed. Baskets and tools...

               EXT - FIELDS - NIGHT

               We find the Creature working by the light of a refulgent 
               moon, hacking away at the soil, tilling the earth...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAWN

               The Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house. He 
               scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out. All the 
               baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before 
               the door.

               The door opens. Felix steps out and trips on a basket, 
               sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips. 
               He sits up, gazing in wonder.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               A sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall.

               The Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato.

               A pig comes snuffling at his elbow. He shoves him away. Go 
               find your own. Inside, the family is enjoying a much more 
               generous meal than the last one:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I wish we could thank our benefactor.

                                     FELIX
                         Nothing in this life comes free of 
                         cost. I'd like to know who and why.

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's the Good Spirit of the forest.

                                     FELIX
                         Who's been filling your head?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         It does no harm.

                                     FELIX
                              (peers at him)
                         Oh, I see.

                                     THOMAS
                         Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?

               Felix and Marie exchange a look. He's not as amused as she 
               is, but lets it go. She smiles at the children.

                                     MARIE
                         Of course it is. Now finish your 
                         food before it gets cold.

               EXT - POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. The cow is grazing at 
               a distance. The Creature creeps into view, listening to the 
               music. Grandfather senses his presence. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Who's there? Felix? Children?

               No response. He turns back. Unsettled. Continues playing.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches Marie instructing the children in their 
               letters. A half dozen words are written in chalk on a slate 
               board. Maggie is trying to puzzle one out:

                                     MAGGIE
                         ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.

                                     MARIE
                         Good! And now the next

                                     CREATURE
                              (mimicking the effort)
                         ...freh...nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.

               He's delighted to have uttered his first word.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               Felix is chopping lengths of wood, dulled by the task. The 
               children are stacking the wood on a litter.

               EXT - FIELD - DUSK

               Felix and the children walk home. The litter of wood is being 
               dragged by their cow...

               EXT - HOUSE - DUSK

               Felix stacks the last pile of wood under the eaves. Marie 
               meets him at the door, takes his hands.

                                     MARIE
                         Your hands are bleeding again. Come 
                         in. I'll rub liniment.

               They go inside. The door closes. CAMERA PUSHES to the pigsty. 
               Eyes peering out.

               EXT - WOODS - NIGHT

               The Creature walks along, munching a turnip, axe slung over 
               his shoulder, muttering:

                                     CREATURE
                         .brread... motherrr... frriend...
                              (stops, gazes up)
                         Treeeeee. 

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The walls around the house are stacked impossibly high with 
               cords of wood. Felix and Marie gaze out the door. Stunned.

                                     FELIX
                         What is going on here?

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Snow is drifting outside the tall dormer window. We find 
               Victor at his desk, reading a letter:

                                     VICTOR
                         "...but it's been so long since I've 
                         heard from you. Remember the vow we 
                         took the night you left? You must be 
                         honest with me if your feelings have 
                         changed. Answer for the sake of our 
                         friendship, and both our future 
                         happiness."
                              (pause)
                         She wrote that four months ago.

               ANGLE SHIFTS to include Henry. He's been listening.

                                     HENRY
                         A woman like that is far too rare to 
                         be taken lightly.

               Victor ponders the letter. He lays it next to the locket, 
               pulls out a sheet of paper and quill, begins to write...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature observes another lesson. Six more words are 
               chalked on the board. Thomas is struggling with the first:

                                     THOMAS
                         Ch...uur-ch. Church.

                                     CREATURE
                         Ch...uuu...ch.

                                     MARIE
                         Good. And the next.

                                     THOMAS
                         Fl...oww.

                                     CREATURE
                         Floww...

               And then, amazingly, the Creature finishes the word before 
               Thomas does:

                                     CREATURE
                         ...wwer. Flower.

                                     THOMAS
                         ...wer. Flower?

                                     MARIE
                         Very good! Maggie. Try the next.

               Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch:

                                     CREATURE
                         Garrr...denn. Garden.

                                     THOMAS
                         Maria! Look! It's snowing!

               The children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering 
               through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The 
               door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in 
               the doorway:

                                     MARIE
                         Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your 
                         death!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Let them play. There's plenty of 
                         wood for the fire.

                                     FELIX
                              (shoots her a look)
                         He's right about that.

               Before she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags 
               her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild 
               snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter.

               THE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having 
               the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. 
               Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         It's snnowwinng.

               EXT - HOUSE - DAY

               Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix 
               and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has 
               his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               TRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, 
               the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, 
               looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. 
               Happy as a kid himself.

               Maggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing 
               their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and 
               hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed 
               to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, 
               Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree.

                                     MAGGIE
                         That one! It's the most beautiful 
                         tree I've ever seen!

               Felix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit 
               up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of 
               ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and 
               laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire

                                     CREATURE
                         Most beautiful... tree...

               The kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to 
               the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light.

               The children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out 
               into the darkness:

                                     MAGGIE
                         Merry Christmas!

               The door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries 
               closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with 
               a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board 
               is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering 
               of a glowing angel and a message:

                                     CREATURE
                         For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of 
                         the... Forr-rest.

               He snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the 
               house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize.

               He plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it 
               gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to 
               reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies.

               He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad.

               He picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes 
               going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts 
               huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. 
               Screw potatoes and turnips.

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The children race out the door to find the plate empty. And 
               a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard,

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. 
               Marie reads a book aloud:

                                     MARIE
                         ...with particles of heavenly fire, 
                         the God of Nature did his soul 
                         inspire... and pliant still the 
                         ethereal energy which wise Prometheus 
                         tempered into paste...

               The Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the 
               concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, 
               and pulls out what's been there all along:

               Victor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds 
               the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from 
               the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head 
               this way and that. Slowly:

                                     CREATURE

               EXT - GRANDFATHER'S POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. Again, the Creature 
               approaches to listen. Grandfather stops. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I know you're there.
                              (waits for a response)
                         Won't you speak to me?

               The Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man 
               waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a 
               spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal.

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               ...and we CONTINUE PUSHING SLOWLY IN as the Creature reads:

                                     CREATURE
                         ...of sscience... and to c-create...

                         bodieess I have... gatherrred...

               He turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's 
               Victor's sketch of his patchwork man. The rendering includes 
               suture marks where the pieces were joined.

               The Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the 
               penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going 
               wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too 
               horrible to conceive...

               ...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge 
               of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm... And the 
               massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an 
               exact match to the drawing. He throws his head back in an 
               animalistic PRIMAL SCREAM, face twisted in a mask of utter 
               horror, Munch's painting made flesh...

               IN THE WOODS

               ...and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns 
               from chopping wood. His family gathers, eyes wide, listening 
               to the sound trail off. Softly:

                                     FELIX
                         God in heaven.

               IN THE PIGSTY

               A massive hand rips the page from the journal, raises it in 
               a clenched fist.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature huddled in a corner, 
               dropping his head into his arms to hide his face. Sunlight 
               throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats. He 
               sobs, wracked with despair as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT - VALLEY - DAY

               The house is distant below. Felix and his family are heading 
               out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow 
               before them. Only Grandfather is missing.

               The gentle MUSIC of the recorder drifts up from the house.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill. 
               Watching. Waiting. The family dwindles in the distance.

               INT - HOUSE - DAY

               For the first time, we actually see the inside of the house 
               from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall.

               Grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder.

               The Creature's face appears at a window. Peering in. He ducks 
               from view, appearing at another window. Making sure the house 
               is otherwise empty. He vanishes again. The door swings 
               silently open. His figure fills the doorway.

               Grandfather stops playing. Silence.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Would you like to sit by the fire?

               The Creature enters. Sits. Holds his hands toward the embers, 
               feeling the warmth.

                                     CREATURE
                         Nice.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         The music? Or the fire?

               Grandfather offers him the recorder. The Creature hesitates, 
               takes it, inept where such delicacy is required. He puts it 
               to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones. He gives 
               it back, huffing air, delighted.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'm glad you finally came to the 
                         door. A man shouldn't have to scurry 
                         in the shadows.

                                     CREATURE
                         Better that way... for me.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why?

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm... very, very ugly. People are 
                         afraid. Except you.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (smiles)
                         It can't be as bad as that.

                                     CREATURE
                              (soft)
                         Worse.

               The old man-reaches for his face. The Creature draws back.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I can see you with my hands. If you'll 
                         trust me.

               The Creature decides to trust. He eases forward. Grandfather 
               runs his fingers over his features. Gently:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You're an outcast.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. I have been seeking my friends.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Friends? Do they live around here?

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. Very close

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why do you not go to them?

               The Creature pauses. Emotions swirling. Afraid to continue.

                                     CREATURE
                         I have been... afraid. Afraid... 
                         they will hate me... because I am so 
                         very ugly... and they are so very 
                         beautiful

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (softly)
                         People can be kinder than you think.

                                     CREATURE
                         I am afraid.

               Grandfather reaches out and takes the Creature's hands.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.

               The Creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest 
               like a panicking child. His monstrous eyes well up with tears. 
               Trying to get the words out:

                                     CREATURE
                         I love them... so very much. I want... 
                         I want... them to be my ff-family. I 
                         II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm-
                         mmuch...

               The Creature pauses. Trying to get the words out. And the 
               door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands 
               Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She 
               lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself 
               on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't let them hate me!

               Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose 
               in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the 
               children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the 
               Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling 
               to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, 
               Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, 
               again and again, trying to kill the thing...

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Leave him alone!

               ...the CREATURE SCREAMING and taking the blows, writhing 
               across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his 
               pleading hands. The CREATURE rolls from under the brutal 
               beating and sails out the door.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               The Creature runs bleeding and sobbing, a specter sailing 
               among the trees with greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings. 
               Running from the horrified screams of rejection still echoing 
               in his mind.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               A snowscape. Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed 
               with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his 
               breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands 
               clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the 
               anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat.

               A realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the 
               inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen 
               palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes.

               HOUSE - DUSK

               The sky is brewing. The Creature runs across the courtyard 
               toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out. See? 
               Here's the flower you gave me. Don't you understand?

                                     CREATURE
                         It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!

               Nothing. He glances around. The pigs are gone. Chickens too.

               The Creature's eyes go wide. He dashes to the house

               HOUSE - DUSK

               ...and bursts in to find it empty. Items have been scattered 
               and left behind. Books, clothes, even the old man's recorder. 
               They left in a hurry.

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no.

               HOUSE - NIGHT

               We hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being 
               ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. 
               The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. 
               He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a 
               satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's 
               recorder jammed in his belt.

               A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning 
               the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along 
               with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting 
               as the house is consumed...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               Massive pale gray feet walking through the snow. ANGLE 
               WIDENING to reveal a lone, windswept figure traversing the 
               glacier with a walking staff. Struggling toward the crest of 
               a ridge. Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind.

               THE CREATURE rises from below the crest and gazes down.

               Glowering with triumph at achieving his goal. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Geneva.

               AERIAL SHOT sweeps up the slope of the glacier like the wind 
               itself, rising magnificently past the tiny figure standing 
               on the ridge, sailing up over the crest... to reveal the 
               valley and lake of Geneva below.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY (SPRING)

               Sunlight streams through the dormer window. Birds twitter on 
               the ledge outside. The trees are in bloom. Victor stands 
               dressed and ready to go, taking one last pensive look around 
               at the now-empty garret. Henry appears:

                                     HENRY
                         Our carriage is here.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT CITY GATES - DAY

               Bustling with activity. Hopeful. A traffic snarl is jammed 
               up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city. 
               People, carriages, wagons, goods. We find Professor and MRS. 
               KREMPE saying goodbye to Victor and Henry:

                                     MRS. KREMPE
                              (watching the gates)
                         Such a terrible winter. I'll praise 
                         God to see those gates open again.

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll have all your things sent on. 
                         They should arrive soon after.
                              (Victor nods)
                         It's been a rough time, lad. For us 
                         all. But if you'd like to come back 
                         and finish out your final term once 
                         university re-opens...

               A ROAR goes up from the crowd. The gates are finally opening 
               as SOLDIERS swing them aside. The traffic starts to flow.

               Victor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Professor. For everything.

               Krempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug.

                                     KREMPE
                         Write and let us know you've arrived 
                         safely.

               Victor breaks the embrace. He and Henry clamber into the 
               carriage. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Take me home, my friend.

               Henry signals the DRIVER. The reins snap. The carriage lurches 
               away, easing into the flow of traffic as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               William, now 10, comes charging up the steps with a small 
               package under his arm, nearly bowling over Mrs. Moritz as he 
               sails past her hollering his head off:

                                     WILLIAM
                         HE'S COMING HOME!

               INT - PARLOR - DAY

               Willie careens into the parlor, where Elizabeth and Justine 
               are entertaining FRIENDS.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth! Justine!

               Father enters, trailed by HOUSEHOLD STAFF.

                                     FATHER
                         What's all the fuss? Why are you 
                         shouting?

                                     WILLIAM
                         He's coming home! Tonight!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Who? Victor?

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's what I'm telling you!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (swept with relief)
                         Thank God.

               Willie thrusts the package into her hands. She hesitates

                                     FATHER
                         Open it.

               Willie scrambles to bring her the letter opener. Elizabeth 
               lays the package down, slits it open. Willie peers in.

               Elizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all. She 
               presses the catch. The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's 
               miniature oil painting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's Victor!

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's beautiful! May I?
                              (takes the locket)
                         He looks so handsome.

               Elizabeth pulls out the letter. Apprehension and hope. She 
               begins to read. The others watch her. Waiting. Her face lights 
               up, blinking back tears. She remembers to breathe.

                                     FATHER
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let this locket be a token of the 
                         vow we took the night I left.
                              (beat)
                         He's coming home to marry me.

               Instant pandemonium and joy... except from Justine, whose 
               heart quietly breaks. Father and the others ROAR with approval 
               while Willie jumps and shouts:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Married! The two of you?

                                     FATHER
                         Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you 
                         were children!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (softly)
                         That's wonderful.

               She hands the locket back. She slips quietly from the room, 
               unnoticed by the others...

               INT - ENTRYWAY - DAY

               and hurries down the hall, fighting back tears.

               RESUME PARLOR as Elizabeth is swept up in congratulatory 
               conversation. Willie grabs the locket, admiring it:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth? Can I take this to show 
                         Peter?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Willie, it's not a toy for your 
                         friends.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll take extra special care, I 
                         promise! Pete's never seen what Victor 
                         looks like! He'll admire it 
                         enormously!

               Willie's so solemn and earnest that Elizabeth has to smile.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few 
                         hours.

               The boy takes off like a shot. Father throws his arm around

               Elizabeth, announcing to all:

                                     FATHER
                         Join us for champagne! My son is 
                         coming home!

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               Geese scatter as Willie comes racing across the grounds. He 
               clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded 
               acreage behind the house. His favorite shortcut.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - LATE DAY

               Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket 
               clutched in his hands, admiring it. He can't get over the 
               fact that his brother's finally coming home.

               He pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie 
               and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds 
               further and further into the woods...

               EXT - POND - LATE DAY

               ...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting 
               half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the 
               water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly-
               pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME.)

               Willie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but 
               listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't 
               noticed him...

               ...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right 
               out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops 
               from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as 
               the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet:

                                     CREATURE
                         Wait! Don't be afraid!

               The boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from 
               the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped 
               object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket.

               At the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He 
               raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does 
               have reason to be afraid.

               The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, 
               teeth grinding in greater and greater rage. Eyes wild.

               THEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush. The 
               terrified boy. The pursuing monster. Faster and faster...

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN KITCHEN - DUSK

               Whirling with activity. Mrs. Moritz supervises the staff.

               Elizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations.

               Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen 
               staff. Carrots go flying.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine! Pay attention!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (tight)
                         Yes, Mother.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (pulls her aside)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (even tighter)
                         Fine.

               Justine sees genuine concern. She softens:

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'll be all right. Really.

               Father enters with Claude. Both men worried.

                                     FATHER
                         Have you seen Willie?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is he not back yet?

                                     FATHER
                         Claude rode over there to see if 
                         held lost track of time. They say he 
                         never arrived.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's far too late for him to still 
                         be out.

               EXT - MANSION - DUSK

               Elizabeth exits with the others

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find 
                         him.

               He rushes to gather the men. Elizabeth gazes off. Wind kicking 
               up. Night approaching. Almost too dark to see.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE/WOODS - NIGHT

               A massive search in progress. People are scouring the fields 
               on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name. Elizabeth enters 
               frame, calling out:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         WILLIE!

               LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.

               EXT - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

               The stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame 
               in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern 
               held high...

                                     JUSTINE
                         WILLIE!

               ...and one of the "tree trunks" turns out not to be. It darts 
               abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, 
               Justine enters the woods. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING sends shadows 
               skittering among the trees...

               EXT - ROAD TO MANSION - NIGHT

               ...And the storm is now a raging downpour, TILT DOWN to reveal 
               a coach clattering through the rain.

               INT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor is peering out the window flap.

                                     VICTOR
                         There! Look!

               Henry cranes to look. A LIGHTNING FLASH stutters the mansion 
               briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road,

                                     HENRY
                         Quite a place.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         For what?

                                     VICTOR
                         This. My home. My family.
                              (softly)
                         If not for you, I'd be dead in a 
                         burial pit somewhere.

               Henry smiles, squeezes his shoulder. The carriage lurches 
               violently, tossing them forward.

               EXT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor jumps from the coach as the DRIVER wrestles his rearing 
               horses under control and points. Victor turns.

               Elizabeth stands in the downpour like a ghost. Drenched to 
               the bone. Weeping from the depths of her soul. Holding Willie 
               in her arms. The boy's arms hang limp, his head dangles back. 
               Victor starts forward, stunned, unable to comprehend, running 
               faster and faster...

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth?

               ...and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming 
               figures in the storm. Victor reaches her first as the others 
               crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling 
               as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling 
               Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, -- 
               seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a SCREAM, 
               and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him 
               and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we

               INT - MANSION - FATHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Silence. All we hear now is the SOFT TICKING of a clock.

               Henry tenderly ministers to Father, who lies gravely ill.

               INT - PARLOR - MORNING

               Elizabeth is sitting. Elbows crossed. Holding herself 
               together. Face ashen. Dazed. Still in shock. Mrs. Moritz is 
               nearby, looking much the same. Eyes swimming with tears.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         We'll organize another search now 
                         that it's light enough. We'll find 
                         her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.

               Henry comes downstairs. He and Victor confer in whispers 
               then approach Elizabeth. Victor crouches before her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What is Father's outlook?

                                     HENRY
                         I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet 
                         and proper care he may eventually 
                         regain some or most of his strength.

               Victor squeezes her hand. Comfort and strength.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Thank you, Henry.

               There's a KNOCKING at the front door.

               INT - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

               Victor opens the door. POLICEMEN hover outside. Faces grim.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended 
                         the murderer. Not five miles from 
                         here, hiding in a barn.

                                     VICTOR
                         Who is it?

               The policemen trade uneasy glances.

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                         It's very unsettling, sir. And quite 
                         strange. Perhaps you'd better come 
                         with us.

               INT - JAIL CELL - DAY

               Victor is led in by policemen. The JAILER unlocks the cell.

               Victor enters as the men depart. Victor is alone, staring at 
               a FIGURE huddled in the corner, pooled in shadow. We get the 
               impression of long, dangling hair. The figure stirs...

                                     FEMALE VOICE
                         Victor?

               ...and leans into the light. Justine. Pale. Dazed. Scared

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor! It's you! Thank God!

               She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms. He reacts 
               stiffly, not at all sure he wants her touching him.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Is it true? What they say about 
                         Willie? Is it true?

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes.

               She dissolves into tears. Barely able to breathe.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Willie. My poor little angel.
                              (looks up)
                         Victor! They think I did it!

                                     VICTOR
                         Did you?

               Justine pauses. Stunned. Her eyes on his. Here's the deepest 
               betrayal ever experienced. Her heart turns to ash.

                                     JUSTINE
                              (low)
                         I don't believe... I am in need of 
                         your comfort... anymore.

                                     VICTOR
                              (a whisper)
                         Did you, Justine?

               Beat. She hauls off and slaps him hard enough to rock his 
               head around. Then she slaps him again. Harder.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Get out!

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               The courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older 
               KITCHEN MAID is on the stand.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         I found her sobbing her eyes out. 
                         Poor thing, I said, what's all this? 
                         And she spilled her heart to me about 
                         Master Victor. How she'd always loved 
                         him, and now he was coming home to 
                         marry mistress Elizabeth.

               A MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a 
               stunned glance.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         She cried and cried about the 
                         beautiful locket he'd sent. How she 
                         wished it was hers. She swore me 
                         never to tell a soul.
                              (peers at Justine)
                         That was before the boy went missing, 
                         a'course.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Victor is on the stand:

                                     VICTOR
                         I always viewed her with brotherly 
                         affection. I had no idea of her 
                         feelings for me.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Rejection can be a powerful wound. 
                         People have been known to do uncanny 
                         things.

                                     VICTOR
                         But to commit so ghastly and terrible 
                         a crime against a child she loved?

               Victor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to 
               Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's hard to believe.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Elizabeth is on the stand:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Justine and I grew up as sisters. I 
                         know her better than anybody.

                                     DEFENDING COUNSEL
                         Do you think it possible she committed 
                         this crime?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         William was as much her child as 
                         mine. We were both mother to him.
                              (beat)
                         I believe she would sooner have 
                         strangled the life from her own body.

                                     DEFENDING COUNSEL
                         Then you consider the charge without 
                         merit.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I consider the charge imbecilic.

               INT - COURT ROOM - DAY

               Justine is now on the stand:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes. I took refuge in the barn. 
                         Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? 
                         Freezing and wet? I was exhausted 
                         and could search no longer.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And is it true, Miss Moritz, that 
                         you love Victor Frankenstein? That 
                         your heart was broken?
                              (off her silence)
                         Answer the question. Do you love 
                         Victor Frankenstein?

               Her gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, 
               trapped.

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have always loved him.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Is it also not true that you murdered 
                         his brother William in a misdirected 
                         crime of passion?

                                     JUSTINE
                         Murder Willie? In my heart, he was 
                         our child. Victor's and mine. Such a 
                         thing could never have entered my 
                         mind.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         So you have claimed. Yet you have no 
                         explanation for this.
                              (holds up the locket)
                         The locket last seen in the hands of 
                         the poor murdered child was found 
                         hidden in your dress the morning 
                         following the murder. The locket you 
                         so coveted.
                              (leans close)
                         How did it come to be in your 
                         possession?

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have no knowledge of that.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               A PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe 
               flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to 
               the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor 
               just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling 
               from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still 
               twitching.

               EXT - SAME FIELD - NIGHT

               Another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body 
               dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor 
               looms from the darkness, staring.

               And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs 
               his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up 
               into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous 
               necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. 
               He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, 
               draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to-
               eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Frankenstein.

               Victor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his 
               arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look 
               there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating 
               Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then 
               the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness.  
               Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, 
               gazing at the scaffold, horrified.

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!

               Screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms 
               around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking 
               to his knees, weeping helplessly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.

               INT - MANSION - STUDY - DAWN

               Victor pulls a carved box from a shelf. Opens it. Lying inside 
               in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 
               Collier flintlock revolvers.

               MANSION - DAWN

               Victor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on 
               a horse held by Claude. Elizabeth is at his heels.

                                     VICTOR
                         My mind was not playing tricks. He 
                         was there in the storm... gloating 
                         over his crimes... challenging me to 
                         come.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         But why risk yourself? Hasn't this 
                         family suffered enough?

                                     VICTOR
                         I've no choice

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If what you say is true, it is a 
                         matter for the police!

                                     VICTOR
                         They've done a fine job. Hanging an 
                         innocent for the crime of a fiend.

               He rams the rifle into its scabbard, turns to her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (softly)
                         Do you know this man? Is there 
                         something between you?

                                     VICTOR
                         I know only that he is a killer.  
                         And I shall bring back his carcass.

               Victor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off. TILT UP 
               to the mountain. Shrouded in snow. Waiting.

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               A lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge...

               Victor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and 
               unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the 
               glacier. A bitter wind blows...

               They plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding 
               before our eyes. Primeval and vast...

               The horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is 
               that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the 
               cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the 
               snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him.

               The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great 
               bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box 
               from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the 
               snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair 
               of revolvers.

               He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of 
               white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the 
               flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the 
               rocks and crags. Searching.

                                     VICTOR
                         WHERE ARE YOU?

               He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then 
               FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is 
               running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, 
               greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings.

               Victor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and 
               angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the 
               achievement of actually having created life.

               He pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an 
               eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. 
               Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. 
               Still the Creature comes.

               Victor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, 
               firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking.

               Firing. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking...

               ...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean 
               out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning 
               off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips 
               over the edge of the precipice.

               Victor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a 
               30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks 
               up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge 
               to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a 
               cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him 
               sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...

               INT - ICE CAVE - DAY

               ...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling 
               and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to 
               sprawl heavily to the cave floor.

               Winded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see 
               the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra 
               clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a 
               rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates.

               A huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is 
               coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. 
               Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as 
               the Creature enters...

               ...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers 
               down. He tosses a few more sticks on the flames. Pause.

               He raises his hand before Victor's eyes, bony fingers curling 
               to clutch an invisible throat. Victor is petrified

                         was my rage. And when I let him go, 
                         he fluttered to the grass like a

               The Creature gazes down at Willie's body. He stares at the

               Tears welling. Overcome with shame and horror.

               He falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail 
               echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy.

               Justine is asleep in the hay. Haggard, wet, exhausted. The

                         What did you find?

               Victor glances over. Claude has pulled the Collier pistols 
               from the saddlebags and caught a strong whiff of powder.

                                     CLAUDE
                         These have been fired.

                                     VICTOR
                         At shadows. My nerves got the better 
                         of me.

               Victor walks on toward the house with Elizabeth

               EXT - GARDEN - DAY

               ...and we find them in discussion by the fountain:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What sort of task?

                                     VICTOR
                         It's not something I can explain 
                         now. Perhaps someday.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What of our marriage? Victor, we've 
                         had so much tragedy. I want this 
                         family to live again.

                                     VICTOR
                         So do I.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         We need each other now, I need your 
                         comfort and strength, not separation 
                         and solitude.

                                     VICTOR
                         A month at most, that's all I ask.
                              (draws close)
                         Elizabeth, please. Things have not 
                         yet resolved. I must take steps to 
                         see that they do. For our family's 
                         sake. For our sake.
                              (caresses her face)
                         You are life itself. We shall seal 
                         our vow. The moment I am done.

               He leans forward to kiss her... and pauses, hearing the 
               distant MUSIC of a recorder echoing from the hills...

               INT - BEDROOM - DAY

               Victor sits at bedside, holding Father's hand. The old man 
               is a weak and frail shadow of his former self.

                                     VICTOR
                         You must regain your strength to 
                         preside at our wedding... and spoil 
                         your grandchildren later on. These 
                         are duties you cannot shirk.

               Father smiles faintly.

               Victor squeezes his hand, whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         We're all safe now. I promise

               INT - MANSION ATTIC - DAY

               Murky and dark. Victor enters, yanks a dusty curtain off a 
               window to let in some daylight. He picks up a pry bar, 
               approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary. 
               One in particular is quite large. He rams the bar into the 
               wood, prying it open... and CAMERA PUSHES IN to reveal a 
               dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw.

                                     VICTOR
                         God forgive me.

               MONTAGE:

               Victor assembles his equipment, recreating the lab; bolting 
               together the sarcophagus, now resting in its cradle. Hanging 
               the huge glass tube, adjusting the boom. Installing the 
               ceiling tracks and hoist mechanism. Playing out the copper 
               wire along the ceiling beams. Hooking up the galvanic 
               batteries and generators. Testing the electrical circuit 
               with goggles and thick gloves, getting a huge cascade of 
               sparks...

                                     HENRY (O.S.)
                         I prayed never to see these again...

               Victor turns. Henry stands in the doorway.

                                     HENRY
                         Whatever they are.

               Henry enters, runs his hand over the gleaming surface of the 
               sarcophagus, circles toward Victor.

                                     HENRY
                         I won't bother asking what or why. 
                         You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just 
                         hope you know what you're doing...
                              (draws close)
                         ...because if this is a repeat of 
                         Ingolstadt, I won't be around to 
                         pick up the pieces.

               CAMERA PUSHES PAST to the Da Vinci print on the wall, contact 
               points still daubed with red...

               EXT - CEMETERY - NIGHT

               CAMERA DRIFTS among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight:

               SOMEONE hunched in a grave, digging madly, dirt flying. We 
               hear the THUNK of a shovel hitting wood

               INT - COFFIN - NIGHT

               ...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He 
               peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT

               The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping 
               the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses 
               as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself 
               onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer 
               window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature 
               enters with his prize...

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               ...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the 
               table before us.

               TILT UP TO:

                                     CREATURE
                         I want her.

               Victor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. 
               Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes.

               Knowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's 
               dead. He can barely get the words out:

                                     VICTOR
                         Why... her?

                                     CREATURE
                         Her body pleases me.

               That's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's 
               all he can do to keep from throwing up.

                                     CREATURE
                         Materials, remember? Nothing more. 
                         Your words.

               Victor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         My words.

               He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying 
               not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, 
               probing the back of the neck with his fingers.

                                     VICTOR
                         The brain stem was destroyed by the 
                         hanging. We'll need another. The 
                         body looks like it will do, but some 
                         extremities are too decayed. They'll 
                         have to be replaced. The fresher the 
                         better.

               EXT - ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

               Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE 
               servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against 
               the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. 
               Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her 
               skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL 
               FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best 
               saucy smile:

                                     PROSTITUTE
                         Want some yourself? Or just like to 
                         watch?
                              (draws close)
                         What do you say, lover? I can make 
                         it good for you.

               The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to 
               her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her 
               off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in 
               his palm. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         I know you can.

               And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine.

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining 
               her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror.

                                     VICTOR
                         What is this?

                                     CREATURE
                         A brain. Extremities.

                                     VICTOR
                         This was not taken from a grave.

                                     CREATURE
                         What does it matter? She'll live 
                         again. You'll make her.

                                     VICTOR
                         No. I draw the line.

               The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table.

                                     CREATURE
                         You will honor your promise to me!

                                     VICTOR
                              (through gritted teeth)
                         I will not! Kill me now!

                                     CREATURE
                         That is mild compared to what will 
                         come. If you deny me my wedding night. 
                         I'll be with you on yours.

               The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night.

               Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead 
               prostitute. The full horror sinking in.

               INT - ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING

               Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive 
               padlock. He hurries down the steps.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying:

                                     VICTOR
                         No. Not tomorrow, not next week, 
                         Marry me today.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Why the change? What about your work?

                                     VICTOR
                         It was misguided and pointless. Is 
                         your answer yes?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It is

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll leave this afternoon, right 
                         after the ceremony. Pack only what 
                         you need.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Does this have something to do with 
                         that man you saw?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         Yes. We're in danger here. Every 
                         moment we stay.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, tell me why! Trust me!

                                     VICTOR
                         I do. But you must trust me for now.

               INT - BEDROOM - DAY

               A small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's 
               bedside. The old man holds Elizabeth's hand. Softly:

                                     FATHER
                         This is not... the grand wedding... 
                         I had hoped to give you...

               He releases her hand, giving the bride away. She takes her 
               place at Victor's side. Henry stands as best man. The PRIEST 
               faces them:

                                     PRIEST
                         We gather now in the sight of God to 
                         witness this man and woman bond their 
                         lives in matrimonial vow.

               EXT - MANSION - DAY

               Elizabeth gets in the coach. Claude clambers up to the 
               driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out. EIGHT 
               MEN on horseback provide armed escort. Victor addresses the 
               men staying behind, all of whom are also armed:

                                     VICTOR
                         Be especially on your guard. Stay 
                         cautious to a fault.

                                     STABLE HAND
                         Who is this man, sir? How shall we 
                         know him?

                                     VICTOR
                         He is huge and deformed... and quite 
                         insane.

                                     CLAUDE
                         He killed Master William and sent 
                         Justine Moritz to the noose! No 
                         hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard 
                         on sight!

               CRIES of assent.

               Victor pulls Henry aside:

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you sure you'll be all right?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, don't worry. I'll look after 
                         your father. You look after her.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll be back as soon as I've got her 
                         far away and safe. We'll hunt this 
                         fiend down together.

                                     HENRY
                         Only if you'll tell me who he is.

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         I owe you that. Done.

               A quick embrace. Victor leaps into the coach.

               ANGLE FROM FATHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW

               The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen. 
               Those left behind scatter across the courtyard.

               Henry turns and walks back toward the house. ANGLE WIDENS to 
               reveal the Creature at the window.  In the bed behind him, 
               The old man stirs, opening his eyes

                                     FATHER
                         Victor?

               ...and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go 
               wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a 
               prolonged death-rattle... and a soft exhale. The Creature 
               reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture.

               A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, 
               dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across 
               the room, presses him against the wall.

                                     PRIEST
                              (breathless with horror)
                         You're the Devil himself.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes, and I've come to snatch your 
                         soul...
                              (leans close)
                         ...unless you tell me where they've 
                         gone.

               EXT - LAKE GENEVA - DUSK

               A magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds 
               roll in. A ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, 
               rippling the water. TILT DOWN to reveal...

               EXT - FERRY DOCK - DUSK

               Claude trotting to the window of the coach.

                                     CLAUDE
                         That was the last ferry. There's 
                         nothing else till morning.

                                     VICTOR
                         Damn it

                                     CLAUDE
                         We'll ride on ahead and secure you 
                         lodging for the night.

               EXT - RESORT - NIGHT

               A big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake. The storm is 
               raging. Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances.

                                     VICTOR
                         Make sure you keep your pistols dry

                                     GUARD #2
                         They're dry enough. And if they fail, 
                         we've others. And if those fail...
                              (draws his saber 
                              halfway)
                         ...we can always gut the bastard.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. 
                         Now why don't you go upstairs to 
                         your wife? It's not often a man has 
                         his wedding night.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles.

               Elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted 
               through the sheer white nightgown.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You're soaking.

               She approaches, peels off his coat. Victor stares at her, 
               awe-struck. She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms 
               demurely... then laughs at her own modesty.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister no more.

                                     VICTOR
                         Now husband and wife.

               He strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips.

                                     VICTOR
                         I remember the first time I ever saw 
                         you. Crossing the floor of the grand 
                         ballroom with my parents at your 
                         side. So beautiful even then.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (a whisper)
                         I have been waiting for this ever 
                         since.

               She leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, 
               triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable...

               ...kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, 
               CAMERA DRIFTING around them in slow circles, candles spinning 
               like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now 
               onto the bed. Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, 
               bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining...

               Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor 
               sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up 
               the nightgown, making her shudder with desire...

               ...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING.

               He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed 
               and ready on the nightstand.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor!

                                     VICTOR
                         Open this door for no-one!

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               Victor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his 
               pistols. The men converge, shouting in the rain:

                                     GUARD #2
                         I saw him in a flash of lightning! 
                         He vanished toward the lake!

                                     CLAUDE
                         Get after him!

               Several men race off in pursuit. TILT UP from Victor and 
               Claude... as a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the Creature 
               clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent 
               smile. He scurries  silently up, further and further into 
               the tree... closer and closer to the balcony.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth. Tense and waiting. A shadow looms across the 
               balcony... spilling through the French doors... onto the 
               floor... a bony hand reaches for the latch...

               The doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth 
               spins as candles blow out all over the room. The Creature 
               enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't bother to scream.

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men come running back from the lake. They stop before 
               Victor and Claude.

                                     GUARD #3
                         We lost him.

               And GUARD #4's eyes drift up:

                                     GUARD #4
                         Why are those open?

               Victor spins, gazing up. Breath catching in his throat. The 
               French doors are swaying in the wind.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves 
               inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She 
               makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, 
               spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light 
               of the fireplace.

               The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes 
               between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She 
               peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You don't want to hurt me.

               He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty.

                                     CREATURE
                         You're more lovely than I could ever 
                         have imagined.

               FOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs. A HEAVY CRASH of men 
               throwing their shoulders at the door...

                                     VICTOR
                         ELIZABETH!

               ...and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls.

               She tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't 
               have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. 
               He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest 
               with pile-driver force...

               INT - LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT

               ...and her SCREAM is cut short. The men give one last mighty 
               rush at the door...

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               ...and they burst in just in time to see Elizabeth cascade 
               back onto the bed, her chest a massive red stain. The Creature 
               whips toward them, fist glistening with blood...

                                     CREATURE
                         I keep my promises.

               ...and he races across the room as the men OPEN FIRE, 
               shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade 
               of shots. But the Creature is too fast. He hits the leaded 
               window head-on with the force of an anvil...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               ...and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of 
               shattering glass. He drops 40 feet to the grass below and 
               vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most PRIMAL SCREAM 
               OF ALL. He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, 
               cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking 
               moans and sobs of despair:

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         Oh God... he took her heart... he 
                         took her heart from me...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the 
               downpour. He puts her in the coach. Dazed.

               EXT - ROAD - NIGHT

               The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a 
               frenzy, faster and faster.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. Victor jumps 
               down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. Henry 
               appears, rushing out into the rain. Victor goes right past 
               him...

               MANSION - NIGHT

               ...and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls.

               ATTIC - NIGHT

               The door swings in. Victor stands dripping. Holding Elizabeth. 
               Gazing at the gleam of copper...

               MONTAGE:

               And we launch into the final throbbing madness. Victor hacking 
               and chopping. Discarding pieces. Sewing the creation, yanking 
               the catgut tight. Ramming the needles deep. Hoisting the 
               body in the air. Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening 
               the bolts. Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the 
               switch. Screaming at God as the LIGHTNING FLASHES and the 
               body convulses. Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, 
               battering a window open and shut, open and shut. Lowering 
               the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. Releasing the 
               eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the 
               spasming egg The body. Convulsing. Lashing. Screaming in the 
               copper womb. Hair whipping in the fluid...

               Victor shuts down the machinery. He opens the tank and reaches 
               into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. He pulls out 
               his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle 
               a newborn infant's...

               ...And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal 
               Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and 
               collarbone where pieces were joined. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Live.

               Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to 
               draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing 
               in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start 
               her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft 
               murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave 
               violently to dispel the fluid...

               He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers 
               and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping 
               her hand in his. Comfort and strength...

               Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me.

               Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, 
               draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up 
               with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name.

               Blank. Dazed. Stunned. Not a flicker of recognition.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you 
                         remember. Say my name.

               Nothing. He leans forward... and kisses her dead lips.

               Gentle as a sigh. A flicker in her eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         You must. You must.

               Maybe his imagination. Still whispering:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name. Say you remember.

               And slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white 
               hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it 
               out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of 
               recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping 
               slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. He 
               smiles, blinking back tears...

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes. I'll help you remember.

               And he takes her other hand in his. At first it's 
               imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, 
               perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into 
               the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in Victor's 
               eyes as she begins to move. Lurching. Faltering. Unsure.

               You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for 
               guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.

               Trace memories.

               A waltz.

               And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and 
               hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances 
               with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to 
               remember, please remember, and now our WALTZ/LOVE THEME really 
               comes back to haunt us as the MUSIC SWELLS, incredibly lush 
               and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, 
               music only he can hear...

                                     VICTOR
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.

               ...and the worst part? The very worst thing of all? There on 
               the shelf. A large formaldehyde jar. Justine's severed head. 
               Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. 
               Watching them dance. Still a wallflower? No. She's finally 
               finishing her dance with Victor... most of her, anyway. Under 
               the circumstances, it'll have to do...

               ...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in 
               glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes 
               them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening 
               across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, 
               climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo 
               with jagged glass claws...

               ...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. 
               Music echoes abruptly away into silence. Nothing now but 
               rain and distant thunder. In the doorway:

                                     CREATURE
                         She's beautiful.

                                     VICTOR
                         She's not for you.

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. 
                         Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper 
                         suitor.

               The Creature raises his hand. Beckoning. She takes a faltering 
               step. Drawn to him.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth, no!
                              (she turns, puzzled)
                         Say my name.

               Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged 
               child who's wet the bed. She knows she's supposed to 
               remember... but can't remember what remembering means.

               They both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught 
               between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war.

               Please... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts 
               toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. 
               Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A 
               frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look 
               like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of 
               flesh like a patchwork.

               She looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers.

               One belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars 
               marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, 
               sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization 
               creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to 
               Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh 
               God, what's happened to me?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Vic... tor?

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no...

               ...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest 
               pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. 
               She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to 
               find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to 
               peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her 
               own eyes.

               Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering 
               toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. 
               The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.

                                     CREATURE
                         GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!

                                     VICTOR
                         SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY 
                         NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!

               Yes. She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away 
               from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across 
               the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying...

               ...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before 
               they can stop her.

                                     VICTOR
                         NO!

               She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay 
               with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. 
               But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing 
               in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... 
               loathing for herself for what she's become.

               It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no 
               part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp 
               in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. 
               WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts 
               past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead 
               flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as 
               she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the 
               Creature racing after her...

               INT - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

               ...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything 
               she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls 
               herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she 
               plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up 
               on impact.

               VICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the 
               walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in 
               Hell.

                                     VICTOR
                         You killed her! You killed her!

               He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning 
               down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes 
               down at his Maker one last time...

                                     CREATURE
                         We killed her.

               And then vanishes through the smoke and flames.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath 
               a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are 
               all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family.

               Victor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man 
               Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his 
               side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor.

               No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard.

               He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack 
               horse. The animal stands saddled and ready.

               He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a 
               restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a 
               stranger... and then his features soften.

                                     VICTOR
                         All that I once loved lies in a 
                         shallow grave. By my hand.

                                     HENRY
                         Let it go.

               Victor pauses, emotions swirling. Wishing he could grab the 
               dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing 
               the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         You should have been my father's 
                         son. He would have been so proud.

               Victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his 
               horse. Henry runs after him, shouting:

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! COME BACK!

               But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. 
               The past is dead. Henry watches Victor until he's gone from 
               sight, as Willie did so long ago...

               EXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY

               The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept 
               glacier ...

               INT - THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY

               Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled. The cave is 
               now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot 
               where the campfire had been...

               EXT - GLACIER - DAY

               A panorama of snow. Pristine... save for the long trail of 
               footprints stretching off before us.

               Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy 
               horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor.

               He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by 
               the reins. Dwindling across the frozen landscape.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I followed his trail north... always 
                         north... and always one step behind... 
                         never stopping... driven by my fires 
                         of rage... and revenge...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - TWILIGHT

               Victor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able 
               to speak, drained now of everything.

                                     VICTOR
                         A year now I've followed him. Perhaps 
                         more. Only to arrive at this place. 
                         Tired. So very tired. I never did 
                         find... whatever it was... I was 
                         looking for... and neither will you, 
                         my friend.
                              (off Walton's look)
                         Value life above ambition... or those 
                         glittering prizes you seek will 
                         crumble to dust in your fingers... 
                         as they have in mine.
                              (reaches out feverishly)
                         See your loved ones again. I cannot.

               Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest. 
               Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Rest now.

               Victor is silent. His breathing shallow. Walton just sits 
               And waits...

               A SLOW DISSOLVE marks the passage of Walton's long vigil...

               Victor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen. 
               Perhaps, the faces of those he loved. The eyes glaze. A 
               peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward 
               off the chill. Exits the cabin.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT

               Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the 
               ice. His coat is open. Walton joins him. Surprised at how 
               warm it is. He holds up his hand, testing the breeze.

                                     WALTON
                         A warming wind.

                                     GRIGORI
                         This ice will break yet.
                              (glances over)
                         How's our guest?

                                     WALTON
                         He died. Raving about phantoms. He 
                         was mad, poor devil.
                              (beat)
                         Gather a detail. Have the body removed 
                         from my cabin.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Aye, Captain.

               Grigori moves off to gather help. Walton turns and heads 
               back to his cabin.

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Walton enters... and freezes at the sound of SOFT WEEPING.

               He can't see the bad from here. Could it be the dead man? He 
               glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor.

               He eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into 
               view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding 
               the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned.

                                     WALTON
                         Who are you?

               The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim 
               yellow light:

                                     CREATURE
                         He never gave me a name.

               Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the 
               desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen 
               beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with 
               fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move. Unconcerned.

                                     CREATURE
                         You were with him at the end.

                                     WALTON
                              (finds his voice)
                         Yes.

                                     CREATURE
                         I was watching.

               Walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the 
               breeze, chilled at the thought. The Creature returns his 
               gaze to Victor.

                                     CREATURE
                         I longed to be with him. But I wanted 
                         his final moments to have peace. I 
                         could see you were a friend to him.

                                     WALTON
                         What is that to you? Evil as you 
                         are.

                                     CREATURE
                              (swivels his gaze)
                         I am as he made me. In his own image.

                                     WALTON
                         You drove him to his torment.

                                     CREATURE
                         And he drove me to mine.

                                     WALTON
                         Then why weep for him?

                                     CREATURE
                         Would you not? He was father. And 
                         mother. We fell from grace together. 
                         He from his God. I from mine.

               The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up 
               with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         Could we ever have forgiven?

               The question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in 
               shadow to the door. Pauses.

                                     CREATURE
                         I've never been shown a kindness. 
                         Show me one now.

                                     WALTON
                         What kindness?

                                     CREATURE
                         Build for him a pyre. Light up the 
                         sky with his passing.

               And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the 
               night...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen 
               mast, axes rising and falling in waves...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier 
               of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough 
               canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice.

               Walton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads 
               a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small 
               campfire drifts past.

               Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances 
               to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other 
               men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it.

               Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He 
               dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men 
               back away, preparing for the coming blaze...

               ...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The 
               men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their 
               bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in 
               frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching.

                                     PILOT
                              (softly)
                         Christ.

               Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks 
               the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, 
               denying his aim.

                                     WALTON
                         It has a right to bear witness.

               Grigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more 
               unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. 
               Men start backing toward the ship.

                                     WALTON
                         Stand fast. All of you.

               The men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards 
               out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. 
               Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of 
               flame. Walton moves forward...

               ...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads 
               as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some 
               fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again.

               It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an 
               earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and 
               force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK!

               Ice cascading skyward.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!

                                     GRIGORI
                              (whips toward Walton)
                         TORCH THE DAMN THING!

               Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The 
               torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back.

                                     WALTON
                         BACK TO THE SHIP!

               The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full 
               retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for 
               miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton 
               to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A 
               heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go 
               for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...

                                     GRIGORI
                         LEAVE IT!

               ...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift 
               opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course 
               across the ice, separating them from the torch.

               They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the 
               others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels.

               THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein 
               snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.

               NO

               He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a 
               massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of 
               cascading water and spinning fragments.

               THE NEVSKY

               The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to 
               the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the 
               ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:

               THE CREATURE

               racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a 
               wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him 
               from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.

               THE NEVSKY

               breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, 
               triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew 
               hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet 
               into the icy water.

               THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped 
               on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to 
               plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice 
               crashing down after him. Gone.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears 
               between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a 
               teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back 
               but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping 
               maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.

               Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag 
               him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the 
               ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori 
               thunderously into the drink.

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as 
               she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching 
               the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to 
               the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their 
               fellows from the water, hauling them to safety.

               FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on 
               its own ice floe.

               THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.

               ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL

               Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces 
               of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming:

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and 
               strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms 
               thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight 
               of his own clothing.

               Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water 
               himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's 
               dying right in front of Walton's eyes.

                                     WALTON
                         SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!

               Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing 
               for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his 
               head back with a bellow of anguish...

               ...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And 
               impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against 
               the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He 
               gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... 
               and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and 
               up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath 
               him. The face of a nightmare.

               The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air 
               right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton 
               scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature.

               The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out 
               his arm, fingers grasping to help.

                                     WALTON
                         Swim.

               The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting 
               away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to 
               him. Come. Grab my hand.

               The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the 
               torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps 
               him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice.

               CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered 
               by ice floes on all sides. Going under.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated 
               ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding 
               nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught.

               Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water 
               and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard.

               BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony 
               fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand.

               The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion 
               and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high.

               Swims grimly on.

               ABOARD THE NEVSKY

               The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men 
               shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing 
               off. The men crowd to his-side.

               THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch 
               held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This 
               is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and 
               sinking beneath the surface...

               ...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe 
               upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself 
               from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of 
               exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the 
               top. Never giving up.

               The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the 
               wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's 
               way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across 
               the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his 
               creation's knees, content to be shown the way...

               The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading 
               his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his 
               skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. 
               So very cold.

               He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, 
               pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks 
               down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated 
               wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his 
               free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother 
               comforting a baby.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning:

                                     GRIGORI (SOFTLY)
                         Don't do it...
                              (screaming)
                         FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!

               THE CREATURE

               turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering 
               in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the 
               sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         For God's sake... I will.

               And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot 
               ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME 
               engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. 
               Blossoming. Roiling.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:

               THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant 
               wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair 
               going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, 
               peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from 
               bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. 
               Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps 
               it never will...

               FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight 
               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams 
               echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.

               WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The 
               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers 
               of lightning kiss the world. Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Home

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The 
               Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through 
               a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.

		NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.


	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for
		some newspaper...

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the
		accident on my police scanner, I
		came up here to have a look. When
		I found it I figured you'd want to
		know right away.

				MURDOCH
		You did the right thing.

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
	grave.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were
		comin' up here to do somethin'
		stupid.

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

					 CUT TO:

	BLACK... now it's over.

				THE END
NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.


	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for
		some newspaper...

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the
		accident on my police scanner, I
		came up here to have a look. When
		I found it I figured you'd want to
		know right away.

				MURDOCH
		You did the right thing.

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
	grave.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were
		comin' up here to do somethin'
		stupid.

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

					 CUT TO:

	BLACK... now it's over.

              The TRACK is SILENT.
 
              The CAMERA looks at a sign.  It reads:

              Gradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of
              CHILDREN playing.

         2    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY
 
              In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying
              a game of softball.
 
              In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17
              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
 
              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.
 
              The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
              SUPERIMPOSE:
 
                                       JULY 4, 1958

              ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot.
 
              The paper target is ripped in the black.
 
              The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
              line.
 
              CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Have you seen Barry?
 
              The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs.

                                  COUNSELLOR
                      He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
                      I saw him.
 
              CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles.

         4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY
 
              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE
              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
 
              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
 
              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      We've got to talk.
 
              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Okay.
 
         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
 
              The Everly Brothers continue as we:

         6    EXT. LAKE - DAY
 
              From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
              CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      You said we were special.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I meant everything.
 
              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

                                  BARRY
                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      I can't, Barry...
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
         7    EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              The TRACK goes SILENT.
 
              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I care very much.
 
              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
 
              BARRY decides to be politic.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn't know.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Oh, you...
 
              She kisses him and they are locked.
 
              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
 
              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
 
              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
 
              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Claudette...

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Somebody'll see.
 
                                  BARRY
                      No, they won't...
 
              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
 
              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Let's go back, Barry...
 
                                  BARRY
                      I need you so much, Claudette.
 
              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
 
              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
 
              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
 
              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
 
              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
 
              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
 
              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
 
              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.

              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
              the mossy floor of the clearing.
 
              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
 
              There is a confused jumble of struggle.
 
              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.
 
              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.
              We can hear the blade strike.
 
              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
 
              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into
              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
 
              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC
              has stopped abruptly.
 
              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
 
              It is completely SILENT.

              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to
              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional
              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final
              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper
              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
 
              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
 
              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.

              We can begin to hear a small-town DJ OVER as a pick-up truck
              moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens.  She has
              a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt.

              The radio is turned way down.  We see that the hand belongs to
              TRUDY, a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with
              a pencil stuck in it.  BUDDY, the boss, is seen in the BG
              working the grill.

              The regulars are there:  five MEN and two WOMEN who always come
              in for breakfast.  They are the retailers, the oil delivery
              man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.
 
              ANNIE walks in the front door, crosses the past the cash
              register and walks down the counter.

              ANNIE wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy.
              Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops RALPH, a crazy hobo
              who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth;
              they swing from him like a strange beard.

                      The job market for teachers is supposed
                      to be the pits these days, but I don't
                      care.  When you have a dream as long as
                      I have, you'll do anything...
 
              A look of surprise passes ANNIE's young face.

                            (frightened, confused)
                      I think we better stop... Please stop...
                      Please!  Stop!
 
              The Jeep's speed increases.
 
                                  ANNIE
                            (continuing)
                      Please!
 
              ANNIE grabs for the ignition key, but the DRIVER's hand darts
              out and slaps ANNIE away.  We see that this hand is missing its
              little finger!
 
              Panicked, without any other recourse, ANNIE looks about her and
              then leaps from the moving Jeep, aiming for the relatively soft
              underbrush alongside the narrow road.

              ANNIE lands, rolls, is upended, scratched by brambles, and

              ANNIE's feet pound the hard-packed dirt.  She looks over her
              shoulder to see the Jeep.  The sun flares on the Jeep's
              windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of
              the DRIVER.

              In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to
              escape.
 
              The Jeep skids to a stop.

              stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes
              past her in a blur.
 
              When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise
              on ANNIE's face.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses
              out of FRAME.

              A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.  We
              hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in-
              need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car.

              In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of
              fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
              They are instantly likeable.
 
              At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
              upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-
              looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
              He is funny and alert.
 
              Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
              American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not
              as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.
 
              MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front
              passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

              She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She
              enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by
              tragedy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
 
                                  NED
                      There you are dead wrong.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ha!
 
                                  NED
                      Sometimes I only think about kissing
                      women.
 
              MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
 
                                  JACK
                      Ow!
 
                                  NED
                      I was just wondering if you thought
                      there'd by any other gorgeous women at
                      Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
 
              MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      How about our last jay?
 
                                  JACK
                      Good call.
 
              JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a
              joint.
 
                                  NED
                      What about the dope paragraph in Mr.
                      Christy's letter?
 
                                  JACK

              She takes the lighted joint and tokes.

              An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of
              a huge tree stump.
 
              The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a middle-aged man in cut-offs,
              a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is
              STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is
              animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
              do things.
 
              In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped
              down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.

              NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
              polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his
              legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the
              big stump.

                      Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
                      Alice?
 
              ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
              and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Cabin B is ready.

                      Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,
                      Marcie and Ned.  Push.
 
              They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.

                      Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
                      You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into
                      'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
                      the boathouse.  I want him to start with
                      the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?

                      I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.
 
              As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.

              a coat of paint on the last canoe.
 
              BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his
              long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
              call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
              trail.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Steve said for you to start on the boats.
 
                                  BILL
                      I finished the boats.
 
              ALICE nods slowly.

                      I'll tell him.

                      To answer your question, my parents once

                      accidents and they went bankrupt.  I
                      promised them I'd reopen if I could.

                                  STEVE
                      Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?
 
              BRENDA turns and nods.

                            (continuing)
                      She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And
                      I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.
 
              They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,
              who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.

        35    EXT. EDGE OF THE LAKE - DAY
 
              STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
              swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as
              he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as
              appropriate.  ("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're
              lifting?" "Not so fast." "I'm walking backward.")
 
              They drop the things carefully.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Come on back here and let's above the
                      float in.
 
              They get behind it and shove it into the water.  NED hops
              aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.

              The screen has gone completely black.  The door to the shed is
              whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the
              sun.  There is a shape.
 
              The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
              on an errand.
 
              As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
              are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
              of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
              etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives
              in sheathes, also hanging neatly.
 
              Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
              shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with
              a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.

              REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      What are those for?  An Indian raid?
 
              She points to the row of hatchets and knives.
 
                                  JACK
                      Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see
                      any life rings?
 
              MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two
              rings.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.
                      Okay, Camper?
 
              She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.
 
                                  JACK
                      For sure.
 
              They exit together.

              STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on
              the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a
              sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
 
              INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of
              foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central
              compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You draw very well.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more
                      time at it.
 
              ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-
              naturedly and keeps on working.
 
              STEVE bends down next to ALICE.
 
                                  STEVE
                      This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
 
              She shakes her head.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Any particular reason?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Just a feeling.
                            (pause)
                      Nothing personal.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (nodding)

                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.  Probably be best for
                      everybody.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You may not care a lot about this place,
                      Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
                      life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme
                      a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it
                      ready.  Next Friday, if you're not
                      happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
                      I'll be grateful.
 
              He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
 
              She looks up.  She nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Next Friday.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
              He stands up.

                      trailer and all that other stuff, but
                      I'll be back around ten.  If you're
                      still up, we can talk, okay?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

              STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are

                                  JACK
                      You want it listed separately?

                      Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the
                      archery range.  If Annie gets here, have
                      her start in on the kitchen.  Do your
                      best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary
                      inspection by the state safety people.
                      I'd like to look good.
 
              He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others
              stand looking before NED breaks the silence.

              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She
              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
 
              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are
              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.
 
              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
              closer to setting up the target.
 
              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the
              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
              eighteen inches.
 
              BRENDA whips around.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
              simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.
 
              She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You're crazy!
 
              She snaps the arrow in half.

                      Did anyone ever tell you you're
                      beautiful when you're angry?
 
                                  BRENDA

              BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
              little she can do.  She laughs.

                            (still laughing)
                      You ever fire one of those bows again,
                      and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.

              bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.

              This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and
              uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,
              the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
 
              The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
              wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a
              bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
 
              The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
              on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary
              sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.
 
              ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
              little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-
              arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a
              matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against
              the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the

              her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her
              face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes
              through the room.
 
              The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in
              the doorway.
 
              It is BILL.

                                  ALICE
                      Did you want something?
 
              She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't

                      but it spooks me.

                            (smiling)
                      You're right.  It makes no sense.
 
              As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.

              MARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the
              CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are
              bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by
              JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The
              screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for
              effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more
              or less for a frolic in the lake.
 
              BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL
              is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused.

                      Help me!  Save me!  The frog people are
                      after me!  It's swim time at Camp Crystal

              A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull
              of a hot afternoon.
 
              At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of
              the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They
              are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no
              real attempt to exert too much energy.
 
              Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's
              POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
              on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.
 
              Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,
              we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.

              ALICE is treading water, talking with BRENDA, as NED comes up
              out of nowhere.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the
                      nitrites or something.
 
              NED surfaces between them.  He looks with googly eyes at ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      There are sand sharks in this lake and
                      they can eat the bathing suit right off
                      you.
 
              ALICE laughs.

                            (continuing)
                      See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.
 
              NED does a porpoise drive and disappears.
 
              BRENDA is not laughing.  She is looking off towards the cabin
              area.
 
              ALICE sees her and look where she looks.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What'd you see?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.
 
              She smiles.

        48    EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet
              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down
              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
 
              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the
              bag, which has something in it that moves.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
              the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.

              The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
              and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the
              animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and
              puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
              coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.
 
              The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.

              BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching
              the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun.  ALICE
              is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand.  BILL
              is on his back, listening.
 
                                  BILL
                      It still hurts?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt,
                      but I thought I could stand anything.
                            (pause)
                      I just wasn't ready for that kind of
                      pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A.
                      When I got back there, he sent a telegram
                      saying he was going back to his wife.
 
              BILL turns over so he can look at her better.
 
                                  BILL
                      What'll you do when you leave here?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.
 
              Various feet enter the FRAME.  BILL and ALICE look up to see
              JACK with his arm around MARCIE, NED toweling his head, and
              BRENDA putting on her blue workshirt.

                      and I are going back to work.
 
              BILL gets up.
 
                                  BILL
                      Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm
                      ready.  Frozen yogurt?

              ALICE smiles at the reference.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll be along.

                      Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll
                      scratch your eyes out...

              growth which have choked off a path.  He wipes the perspiration
              from his eyes and continues along.

              Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There
              are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
              an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights
              made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.

              We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
              parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt
              about his strength.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Not bad.
 
              As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
              little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.

              She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.

              ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it
              wasn't easy for BILL to say.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're very nice.

                      Hope you will.
 
              BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
              blade.
 
              ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place
              to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.

              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
 
              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
 
              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
 
              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
 
              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
 
              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
 
              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.
 
              She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.

              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
 
              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

        57    EXT. MAIN CABIN - DAY
 
              BILL, returning from his last half hour of trail-blazing, hears
              ALICE.
 
                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                      Help!
 
              BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to
              ALICE's cabin.
 
              MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        58    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
 
              ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and
              get her.
 
              BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks
              at ALICE.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a tight whisper)
                      There's a fucking snake in here.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto
              the floor.
 
              MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
              MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
              to see the blood and guts.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,
                      would you get some paper towels?
 
              JACK nods and exits.
 
                                  ALICE
                      How the... did he get in there?
 
                                  BILL
                      Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of
                      your perfume.
 
              JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay now?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
              BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,
              stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.
                            (to JACK)
                      Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
 
              JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
              underneath the wide-fanged snake.
 
              MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper
              toweling.

              Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among
              the late afternoon rays of the sun.  We can hear the sounds of
              the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt.

        60    INT. CAMP KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the
              same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of
              sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and
              some windows which look out on the rear.
 
              BRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian.
              MARCIE is making a guacamole dip.
 
              In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table.
              JACK and BILL are playing.
 
                           BRENDA                        JACK
                   She all right?                Get ready for the schneider.
 
                           MARCIE                        BILL
                   Yeah.  Scared the hell out    No chance.
                   of her.

                           BRENDA                Four zip.
                   How'd it get in the drawer?
 
              ALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after
              getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the
              kitchen.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      How you doin'?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Okay.  Can I help?
 
                                  BRENDA
                      It's catch as catch can.  I'm making a
                      salad.  The guys are planning to cook
                      greaseburgers for themselves.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      There's a lot of dishes if you just want
                      something to do.
 
              ALICE smiles.  Nods.

                                  ALICE
                      The way I feel, that's perfect.
 
              ALICE goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the
              dirty dish pan.
 
              NED comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and
              pieces of old Indian costumery.  He does a bad dance.
 
              JACK and BILL quit their game and come to the doorway.
 
                           JACK                          BILL
                   What the hell?                Where'd you get that stuff?
 
                           MARCIE                        BRENDA
                   Oh, Lord!                     Neddy!

                      goodies in the shed.  I also found this
                      letter which a camper never sent home.
                      Listen.
 
              He takes a letter out of his breechclout.  He pretends to read,
              when really we can see that the paper is blank.

                      night and sucks our counsellor's body...
 
              ALICE leans against the sink and laughs.  She is a very pretty
              girl, younger than she first appeared.

                      He says that whenever I'm scared, I can
                      sleep in his bunk with him.
 
              JACK and BILL laugh.

              ALICE looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side.
              Does she sees something?
 
              The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
 
              The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
              there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it
              stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?
 
              CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.
              When we CUT BACK, the shape is gone.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  Curious.  A cold chill...
 
              ALICE looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about
              food.
 
                           BRENDA                        JACK

              ALICE looks up.  Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.
 
              The bulb does not light.
 
              ALICE pulls it again.

              JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is
              standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.
 
              BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.
 
                                  BILL
                      This is almost like the one at my
                      uncle's cabin in Maine.
 
                                  JACK
                      Here we go.
 
              The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we
              see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
              concentrates.  He bites down on it.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine
              roars into action.
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Now ya' close the switch.
 
              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
 
              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.

              JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and
              cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his
              breathing.
 
              JACK shakes his head.
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
 
                                  BILL
                      Don't get up.  Take a second...
 
              JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.
 
                                  JACK
                      You saved my life.
 
                                  BILL
                      I had to.
 
                                  JACK
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd
                      have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
                      would have ruined my appetite.
 
              JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy
              athlete gets to his feet.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whew.
 
              Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
              looks in.
 
              We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
              switch and a now-silent generator.
 
                                  BILL
                      This puddle was enough to ground you all
                      the way to China.
 
              JACK looks in, too.

                                  JACK
                      Floor probably leaks.  This area is full
                      of springs.
 
                                  BILL
                      A short somewhere.
 
              BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
              another wire.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked
                      itself loose.
 
              He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
 
                                  JACK
                      Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm
                      gonna pick up some lanterns from the
                      equipment shack.
 
              JACKS walks away.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        63    INT. EQUIPMENT SHED - DUSK
 
              The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes
              in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on.
              As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
              slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
              and knives.  They are all missing.
 
              JACK takes his booty and exits.
 
              The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        64    INT. KITCHEN - DUSK
 
              ECU of the lightbulb over the kitchen area.  It flickers on as
              we hear in the BG the sound of the generator start up.  The
              bulb glows, goes down, glows cheerily.

                                  BRENDA
                      That was the telephone.

                                  NED
                      Ha!  You wily oriental!  The phone was
                      "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."
                      "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
 
              JACK comes in with his lanterns followed by BILL.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Last line of Gone With the Wind?
 
                                  NED
                      Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
 
              ALICE listens as she washes the dishes.  It looks as if things
              will be okay.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Shows how much you know.  It's something
                      about tomorrow.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Tomorrow is another day.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Right!  Right!
 
              MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.
 
              Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see.
              ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
              bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but
              the blood is visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      This just plain ain't my day.
 
              BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid.
 
                           MARCIE                        NED
                   You okay?                     Those things can be nasty.
 
                           BRENDA
                   Wash it out real good.
 
              BILL comes up to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
 
              That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
 
              BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
              BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.

              They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest
              continues.

                           ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my
                   I was careless.               guaranteed winner!
 
                           BILL                          MARCIE
                   How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli?
 
                           ALICE
                   Somebody probably dropped
                   something too hard.
 
                                  NED
                      Alice, you're just lucky there are no
                      snakes in the dishwater here.
 
              NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
              has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
 
              Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs
              his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it.
 
                                  JACK
                      What is it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Is it stuck?
 
              NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
              writhes about.
 
                           MARCIE                        ALICE
                   Help him!                     Oh, my God!
 
                           BILL                          JACK
                   Roll him over!                Get behind him more.
 
              As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
              NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish:
 
                                  NED
                      Ta-da!

              REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
 
                                  JACK
                      Not funny, Ned...
 
              BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Wait'll you're really in trouble and see
                      what happens...
 
                                  NED
                      But it's in the brochure!  "Camp Crystal
                      Lake has a full drama program."  You
                      just saw it.
 
              NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE
              walks away.  JACK looks at BILL.
 
                                  BILL
                      Chance to get even?
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll spot you five points.
 
                                  NED
                      Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it
                      again.
 
              NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him.
              The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little
              ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
              stunt.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Ned?  We're gonna be working together
                      for a while.  You're a nice guy without
                      all the entertainment, okay?
 
              NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look
              at the others.
 
                                  NED
                      Tell 'em I'm sorry?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

                                  NED
                      I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
                      z's.  Today wiped me out.
                            (pause)
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're welcome.
 
              The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG,
              MARCIE speaks.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I hope that's the last time we see the
                      Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.

        65    EXT. MAIN CAMP AREA - EVENING
 
              We watch NED come away from the main cabin and walk moodily
              toward his cabin.
 
              The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
              down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.  It
              cuts through.  He flips a few stones in his hand.
 
              NED looks off.  Sees something.
 
              WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a
              cabin.
 
              NED walks towards it.
 
                                  NED
                      Hello?  Can I help you?

        66    INT. KITCHEN AREA - EVENING
 
              ALICE is just drying her hands.  She stands next to a giant
              stack of clean dishes and pots.
 
              BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
              and cucumber slices.
 
              BILL and JACK saunter in.
 
                                  JACK
                      You just had some lucky shots.

                                  BILL
                      Where's Ned?
 
                                  ALICE
                      He went to bed early.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I don't blame him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      He's probably setting up another one of
                      his practical jokes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Yeah, like draining the lake!
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  JACK
                            (to MARCIE)
                      Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
 
              The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."
 
                                  JACK
                            (continuing)
                      Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (kidding)
                      Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
                      small-minded people around here.
                            (to JACK)
                      Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
                      be right with you.
 
              MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
 
              The OTHERS laugh.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        67    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
              There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
              the horizon.
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.  They have
              turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.

                                  JACK
                      Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred
                      and eighty degrees.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
 
                                  JACK
                      I love you.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I love you.
 
              They kiss.  MARCIE pulls back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      What about Neddy?
 
                                  JACK
                      I don't love Neddy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Ned!
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Don't call him.
 
                                  JACK
                      I thought you wanted to give him one of
                      your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do
                      whatever he wants to do, you know.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I guess...
 
              The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
 
                                  JACK
                      Looks like a storm.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I'm a little scared of storms.  Always
                      have been.  Since I was a kid.
 
                                  JACK
                      You?  The brick?
 
              JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
              shadows.  She flashes hers at him.

                                  MARCIE
                      I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a
                      dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.
                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears
                      off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets
                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
 
              A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is
              startled and reaches out for her lover.
 
                                  JACK
                      It's just a dream.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I call it my shower dream.
 
              They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain
              drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
 
                                  JACK
                      This is no dream.  Want to escape for a
                      while?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Lead the way!
 
              JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only
              a half step behind, laughing.
 
              FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme,
              just the rumble of thunder...

        68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
              JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
              nearest bed.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Are you wet?
 
                                  JACK
                      Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman.
 
              He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
              straight up and gives them some light to see by.

              They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
              hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
              towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
              it at the CAMERA.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the
              front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
 
                                  BILL
                      Not if they're where I think they are.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not always this stupid.
 
              She turned back into the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        70    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
              blanket.  Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
              sounds of the rain outside.
 
              The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
              leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
              dribbled down.  As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
              CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
 
              As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
              NED lying in the upper bunk.  In a flash of lightning we
              realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
              their blanket.  The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
              MARCIE's face is contented.  JACK is ready to doze off.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Mmmmmmmph?
 
                                  JACK
                      Mmmmmmmph.

                                  MARCIE
                      Best over...
 
                                  JACK
                      Umhummmmph.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Like waves.  It's never been likes waves
                      before.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whassamatta?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
 
              She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.  While
              still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
              clothing.  JACK gives her room.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (dressing)
                      I know this ain't very romantic, but
                      what can I say?  I don't want to explode.
 
              She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
 
              JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        71    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS - NIGHT
 
              MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
              bathroom facility.  She tries to skip between the raindrops,
              but she knows she'll get a drenching.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        72    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
              and lights it.  He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
              Something overhead catches his eye.
 
              Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
              stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
              We hear the toilet flush.
 
              We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
              graffiti to herself.  We can only see her from the chest up.

                                  MARCIE
                            (reading)
                      "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
                      Makit."  "The Yellow Stream by I.P.
                      Daley."  Not the most original stuff,
                      kids.
 
              There is a noise outside the stall.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?
 
              She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
              playing tricks with her.  MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
              exits the stall.
 
        73    MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
              flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.  There is
              no water.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              PROWLER'S POV:  of MARCIE.
 
              From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
              the sink and turn on one of the spigots.  Water rushes into the
              sink.
 
        74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
              turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks
              to the row of showers and smiles.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Jack?
 
              The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
 
              MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to
              scare her.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
 
              There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower,
              hesitates.
 
              Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She
              reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
 
              She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
              empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain.

                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Allee allee infree!
 
              She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there.
 
              She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Must be my imagination.
 
              In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
              TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash.
              A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
              shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet
              strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor.

              The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
              establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are
              being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
              seated on stools at the counter.

              The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
              older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her
              CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
              counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
              coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
              tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Anything else you want?
 
                                  STEVE
                      No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy.
 
                                  SANDY
                      You can't go back there tonight.  Not in
                      that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded.

                            (drinking quickly)
                      I got to.

                                  SANDY
                      Aw.
 
              SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I have six new counsellor up there.
                      They're all babes in the woods in every
                      sense of the word.
 
                                  SANDY
                      They'll be okay if they know enough to
                      stay in outta the rain.
 
 
                      How much do I owe you?
 
                                  SANDY
                      One night on the town.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I mean...
 
                                  SANDY
                      ...I know what you mean.  Two and a
                      quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to
                      make up for me spending the night alone.
 
              STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
 
                                  SANDY
                            (continuing)
                      You got a roof for that Jeep?
 
              She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a
              tip.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.  I got it on before this--
                            (indicates the storm outside)
                      --all started.
 
                                  SANDY
                      That's thirty percent.
 
                                  STEVE
                      For two lonely nights.
 
              She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
              extra makeup.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
                      self.

              STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes
              and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.

              and starts it up.  He roars off through a big puddle, splashing
              water towards the CAMERA.  The Jeep pulls a small equipment
              trailer.

              a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn.

                      Good point.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Well, it hasn't been that long.
 
              BRENDA smiles.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Long enough for me.
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I think we should go wake them up.  Just
                      in case.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Give them a little while longer.  It's
                      still early, anyway.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I guess...

              The tires squish in the muddy roadway.

              Lighted by dash panel, STEVE tries to concentrate on seeing the
              road.  He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get
              rid of the condensation.
 
              From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
              ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight
              dent in the night.
 
              In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
              bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical
              storm.
 
              STEVE's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio.

              ALICE has finished her coffee.  BILL enters, shakes the rain
              off his poncho and stamps his feet.
 
                                  BILL
                      Got to it just in time.  The generator
                      was running on fumes.  I filled it up.
                      That should keep it humming until Steve
                      gets back.
 
              BRENDA gets up.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Good night, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Good night, Brenda.
 
              BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
              head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
 
              ALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
              she heads off.
 
              BILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Help you clean up?

                      Absolutely.
 
 
 
              She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups
              into the kitchen.

              The door opens and BRENDA comes in with her lantern and
              slicker.  Her actions are direct and business-like.
 
              BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in
              the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
              examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other
              toilet articles.
 
              She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her
              lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She
              stands up, and washes her hands and face.

              She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
              that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
              shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.

              He looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view
              mirror.
 
              STEVE, wearing a yellow slicker, gets out of the Jeep to try to
              flag down the oncoming car.

              STEVE smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police
              car, driven by a middle-aged cop named TIERNEY.  TIERNEY has
              the window down already.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
 
                                  STEVE
                      I think water got into the electrical
                      system.  You ride me back to camp?  I'll
                      get one of my counsellors to drive me
                      back tomorrow morning.

              The weather howls outside.  There's a tapping sound.  BRENDA

                      That could drive a person bug-city.
 
              The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
              perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
 
              BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
 
              The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the
              front door.

              ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
              closer by.  She looks and sees.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
              string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows,
              making the knife tap against the building.

                                  BRENDA
                      Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
 
              She grabs the knife, breaking the string.

              BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a

                      Sgt. Tierney, there's a bad accident.
                      One fatality known, several possibles
                      near mile marker 17 on the Interstate.
                      Bus, tractor trailer.  Over.

                      Roger.  Acknowledge receipt.  Estimate
                      arrival time fifteen minutes.  How copy?
 
              TIERNEY has jammed on his brakes and swung the car around.

                      100%.  I'll tell 'em you'll be there in
                      fifteen minutes.  Out.
 
              TIERNEY bangs the mike down on the holder.  He stops the car.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      Have to drop you here, Steve.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Sure.

              STEVE gets out quickly.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Good luck.
 
                                  TIERNEY
                      Another coincidence.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.

              CU as STEVE watches the lights grow dim in the distance.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as STEVE turns and jogs the other way.  Low

       101    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              BILL and ALICE have made their way to BRENDA's cabin.  From the
              outside they can see the Coleman lantern burning on the table
              within.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Brenda?  Brenda?  You there?
 
              There is no response.  The CAMERA stays in a MCU of ALICE as
              she and BILL cross up the stairs and into the cabin.

              The SHOT continues on ALICE as she looks about the empty cabin.
              Finally she stops, looking down.  The CAMERA continues to hold
              on her face.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill.
 
              BILL crosses over to ALICE.  They are both looking down, past
              the CAMERA LENS.

              ANOTHER ANGLE:  WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE:  the bloody hatchet left
              on Brenda's pillow.
 
              ANGLE on BILL and ALICE:  (as before).  Their faces are serious.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      What the fuck is going on here?

              The rain slants down as BILL and ALICE make their way towards
              Jack's cabin.  They go to the door.  BILL knocks.
 
                                  BILL
                      Jack?

                      Hey, guys!
 
              BILL opens the door to the cabin.

              The door opens at us.  We see the silhouetted figures of BILL
              and ALICE.  BILL flips on the light switch.
 
              The cabin is empty.  Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the
              contents neatly laid out.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

              It is dark inside.  The door slams open at us as BILL and ALICE
              make their way inside.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Marcie?  Brenda?  Jack?
 
              BILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      I think we should call the police, Bill.
 
              BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods
              and turns back to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Okay.
 
              They exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape
              passes between us and the night sky light which comes through
              the windows.  The shape is dragging something.

       106    EXT. OFFICE CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the
              left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office."  BILL
              tries the door, but cannot open it.
 
                                  BILL
                      Sucker's locked.  Who's got the key?
 
              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes
              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the
              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.
 
              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch
              on the desk set several times.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      It's dead.  Try the pay phone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Do you have a dime?  A quarter?
 
                                  BILL
                      No.  There must be some in the desk
                      somewhere.
 
              They fumble through the desk to find some change.  BILL finds
              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay
              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link
              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
              phone lines come in from the pole.  Here we see a dangling
              phone cable which has been recently cut.

              OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
              telephone.
 
                                  ALICE (V.O.)
                      Hello?  Hello?  This damn thing's dead,
                      too.

              BILL and ALICE comes out into the rain, heading for the camper
              van.  They hop in.

              BILL slides behind the wheel.  The keys are in the ignition.
              ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
 
              BILL turns over the engine.  It grinds away but does not catch.
 
              From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
              fail to catch.  We look in the mirror and see someone standing
              in the distance, watching.
 
              BILL gets out of the driver's side.  Slams the door.  The
              CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
              ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.
 
                                  ALICE
                      What's the matter with it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Wet.  I don't know.
 
              He tries a few more times.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Why don't we run?  Just run now?
 
                                  BILL
                      It's over twenty miles to the
                      crossroads.  Steve'll be back in an
                      hour.  Things will straighten out then.
                      We'll take his Jeep and get help.
 
              He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.

                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      Don't worry.  There is probably some
                      really stupid explanation for all this.
                      When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
                      smile.
                            (pause)
                      Promise.
 
              ALICE nods.

              In the FG we see a camp sign.  In the BG we see a figure
              running towards us.
 
              The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
              CHRISTY.  Just as he's about to make the turn into the
              driveway, he looks up and smiles.  He stops and catches his
              breath as the other person catches him in the light of a
              flashlight.
 
                                  STEVE

              BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG,
              ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front
              of her is a large machete.

              BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts
              to doze again.
 
              The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
 
              BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
              it on.
 
                                  BILL
                      Oh, shit....
 
              He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some
              lanterns.  He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong
              table.
 
              BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
              carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.

              It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
 
              BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks
              in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.
 
              Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.
              He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He
              puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.

              Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a

              burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee.
 
              Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin
              and looks out.

              cups.  She stirs the coffee.
 
              Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
              lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.

              for the generator shed.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       120    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT
 
              The door to the shed is closed.  ALICE looks around and then
              puts a hand on the hand.  In CU we see the hand pull.  The door
              doesn't budge.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.
 
              She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls
              until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long
              shadows upwards.
 
              The generator sits silent.
 
              ALICE leans into the shed to look.
 
              The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
              see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear
              the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
              from a branch above.
 
              The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in
              a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
 
              ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?
 
              She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to
              move or turn or run.  The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
              the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
 
              ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.  She
              turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
              cabin.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      Help!  Help!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       121    INT. MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE bursts through the front door into CAMERA.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack!  Marcie!  Help me!
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       122    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
              It is not there.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The knife!
 
              She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
 
              LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the
              couch.
 
              ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
              lamp.
 
              Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
              window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
              shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
 
              It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
 
              ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
              door.
 
              ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
              figure.
 
              ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
 
              When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
              enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,
              pointing back to the rear window.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't
                      help you if you can't talk to me.
                      There, there now...
 
              ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see
              the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
                      Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
                      my God, oh my God... oh God...
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It will be all right.  I'll take care of
                      you.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack?  Marcie?  Ned?
 
              MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It's just this place.  The storm.
                      That's why you're all upset.
 
                                  ALICE
                      No, no, they're all dead...
 
              ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
              without looking.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'll go look.
 
              ALICE's face registers the new terror.
 
                                  ALICE
                      They'll kill you!  Don't leave me!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'm not afraid.
 
              ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
              the back window.
 
                                  ALICE
                      All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie...

              ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body
              sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      Oh, my lord...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
              she picks up the lantern.
 
              ALICE waits at the fireplace.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      So young, so pretty.  What monster could
                      have done such a thing?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
 
              She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      We shall go straight to the police.
 
              ALICE backs up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The killer is still out there.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I will protect you.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, this place... It should never have
                      been a camp.  Not for children.  They
                      had so much trouble here.
 
              The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns
              through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Camp Blood.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
              Strokes her soft hair.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      You know a boy drowned the year before
                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.
 
              ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
              YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!
 
              The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
              version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      We should go now.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No.  That won't be necessary.
 
              As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
              surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
              knife.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't understand.
 
              MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
              of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
              version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                            (filtered)
                      Help me, mommy... save me... please,
                      mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
                      save me....
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (cocking her hand to listen)
                      I am, Jason.  I am.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a little confused)
                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It was my son they killed.  They said he
                      drowned, but I know it was inadequate
                      supervision...
 
              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the
              knife rise behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Mr. Christy will be back soon.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
 
              The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up
              and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
              to strike.
 
              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
              fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      I couldn't let them start this camp
                      again, could I?
 
              ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace
              poker.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I won't let you!
 
              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      No!  No!  No!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
              ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
              cage.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
 
              ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

              MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
              deliberately.
 
              Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT
 
              ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of
              the screen... somebody has latched it.
 
              CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
              the door, snapping the latch.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
              thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as
              ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
 
              TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
              above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
              STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under
              his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
              protrudes from his heart.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
              of legs which swing from the same big tree.
 
              STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we
              see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
              between herself and ALICE.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
 
              The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the
              SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
              bright overhead lights come on.
 
              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
 
              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
              feet.
 
              She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in
              CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,
                      please....
 
              The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
              JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both
              characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
 
              ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
              VOICE OF JASON.
 
              ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
              VOORHEES rave.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
                      breathe... Help me, breathe...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.  She
              strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
              child stops.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (in her own voice)
                      I can't let them kill any more children.
                      Come out now.
 
              She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
              way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
              PROWLER.
 
              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
 
              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
 
              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
              animal bellow.
 
              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
 
              ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
 
              We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her!

              The central area is bathed in light.  The rain has stopped.
              MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
 
              ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.  She stops to
              look back.  MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
 
              ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  The door is thrown back.  ALICE goes in.  Looks
              for a weapon.  Nothing is available.  ALICE sobs with fear.
              She runs.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.

              A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
              through the door.

       129    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              It is a small cabin.  On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
 
              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
              from the wall.
 
              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.
              Empty.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Where are the goddamned bullets?
 
              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
 
              ALICE looks around.

              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.

       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt
              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She
              turns.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
              steps slowly toward ALICE.
 
              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
              drops to the floor.

              ALICE runs out the door.

              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is
              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs
              into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
              then hides there, closing the door behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT
 
              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
 
              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
 
              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are
              turned on.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
                      please.  Kill her, mommy.
 
              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the
              sound of another door being slammed.
 
              ALICE relaxes again.
 
              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the
              idea.
 
              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are
              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large
              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
 
              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
 
              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
 
                                  JASON (O.S.)
                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
 
              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
 
              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Please...
 
              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
 
              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
 
              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
 
              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
 
              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
 
              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.

              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.

              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
              forward, slumped across a thwart.

              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
 
              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
 
              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
 
              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
 
              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
 
              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
 
              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
 
              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
 
              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
 
              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
 
              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.

              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
 
              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.

              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
              and come around to help ALICE.

              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
 
              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.
 
              The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
              SUPERIMPOSE:

              ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot.
 
              The paper target is ripped in the black.
 
              The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
              line.
 
              CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Have you seen Barry?
 
              The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs.

                                  COUNSELLOR
                      He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
                      I saw him.
 
              CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles.

         4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY
 
              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE
              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
 
              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
 
              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      We've got to talk.
 
              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Okay.
 
         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
 
              The Everly Brothers continue as we:

              From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
              CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      You said we were special.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I meant everything.
 
              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

                                  BARRY
                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      I can't, Barry...

         7    EXT. FOREST - DAY
 
              The TRACK goes SILENT.
 
              BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I care very much.
 
              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
 
              BARRY decides to be politic.
 
                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn't know.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Oh, you...
 
              She kisses him and they are locked.
 
              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
 
              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
 
              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
 
              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Claudette...

                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Somebody'll see.
 
                                  BARRY
                      No, they won't...
 
              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
 
              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
 
                                  BARRY
                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
 
                                  CLAUDETTE
                      Let's go back, Barry...
 
                                  BARRY
                      I need you so much, Claudette.
 
              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
 
              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
 
              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
 
              QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
 
              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
 
              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
 
              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
              by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
 
              A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.

              BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
              the mossy floor of the clearing.
 
              Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
 
              There is a confused jumble of struggle.
 
              Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight.
 
              The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward.
              We can hear the blade strike.
 
              BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
 
              MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into
              FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
 
              QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
              She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
              temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC
              has stopped abruptly.
 
              THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
 
              It is completely SILENT.

              The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to
              ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional
              rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final
              position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
              of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper
              left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
 
              The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the
              Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.
 
              TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out.

              We can begin to hear a small-town DJ OVER as a pick-up truck
              moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens.  She has
              a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt.
              She wears her hair in a long braid.  She wears Nike jogging

              The radio is turned way down.  We see that the hand belongs to
              TRUDY, a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with
              a pencil stuck in it.  BUDDY, the boss, is seen in the BG
              working the grill.

              The regulars are there:  five MEN and two WOMEN who always come
              in for breakfast.  They are the retailers, the oil delivery
              man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.
 
              ANNIE walks in the front door, crosses the past the cash

              Suddenly, from between two parked cars pops RALPH, a crazy hobo
              who has two dead rats in his mouth, their tails in his teeth;
              they swing from him like a strange beard.
 
                                  OIL MAN
                      Goddamnit, Ralph!  Get outta here.
                            (to ANNIE)
                      Don't worry about him.  He's harmless.
                            (back to Ralph)
                      G'won.  Git!
 
                                  RALPH
                      It's Friday the 13th.
 
              He giggles and skulks away.
 
                                  OIL MAN
                      Climb on up, Miss.

              The OIL MAN gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig.

              As the truck pulls away, we see RALPH through the windshield,
              standing at the edge of the road.  He is angry and upset now.
              He pats his rats.
 
              The OIL MAN shifts, looks over and smiles.  His two front teeth
              are missing on top.
 
                                  OIL MAN
                      Must be the fourth time somebody's tried

              He nods.

                      Something always happens up there.
 
              He turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the DJ again.

              The oil truck has stopped.  ANNIE stands alongside the driver's

                      Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie.

              ANNIE smiles.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      No sweat.  Thanks a lot for the lift.
 
              He nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have
              been if he were thirty years younger.  He puts it in gear and
              roars off.
 
              ANNIE looks around and sees an old gas station.  It is closed.
              There's a sign which reads:  "No Gas 'Til Sat."  A mangey dog
              sits on the stoop watching ANNIE.
 
              ANNIE kneels down and calls the dog.  The dog comes.  ANNIE
              pets him and then heads off up the road.
 
              The dog watches her go.

              ANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.  It's hot and
              she's late.
 
              She looks up.
 
              From her POV a Jeep barrels along the road towards us.
 
              ANNIE puts out her numb.

              From the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.  The
              DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.  The
              Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.  ANNIE smiles a big delicious
              smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      Hiya!  I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake.
                      Can you help me out?
 
              Apparently the DRIVER nods, because ANNIE beams at us.  She
              tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard.  The DRIVER
              accelerates.

              Still in the DRIVER's POV, the CAMERA watches as ANNIE looks
              around, admires the woods, the Jeep, the day.  Things are going
              her way.
 
                                  ANNIE
                      I can't remember being this excited
                      about anything.  I want to be a teacher
                      when I finish at Southern State.  I
                      guess I've always wanted to work with
                      children.  I hate it when people call
                      'em kids.  Sounds like little goats.
 
              The forest outside the speeding Jeep is deeper and signs of
              civilization have all but disappeared.  ANNIE still turns and
              looks at the CAMERA when she speaks to the DRIVER.
 
                                  ANNIE
                            (continuing)
                      The job market for teachers is supposed
                      to be the pits these days, but I don't
                      care.  When you have a dream as long as
                      I have, you'll do anything...
 
              A look of surprise passes ANNIE's young face.

                      I think we better stop... Please stop...

              ANNIE grabs for the ignition key, but the DRIVER's hand darts
              out and slaps ANNIE away.  We see that this hand is missing its
              little finger!
 
              Panicked, without any other recourse, ANNIE looks about her and
              then leaps from the moving Jeep, aiming for the relatively soft
              underbrush alongside the narrow road.

              windshield, keeping us from being able to see any details of
              the DRIVER.

              In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to
              escape.

              In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of
              fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake.
              They are instantly likeable.
 
              At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed
              upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice-
              looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction.
              He is funny and alert.
 
              Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as
              American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not
              as smart as NED.  He has to think things through.
 
              MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front
              passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

              She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She
              enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by
              tragedy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
 
                                  NED
                      There you are dead wrong.

                      women.
 
              MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.

                      there'd by any other gorgeous women at
                      Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.

                      You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
 
              MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully.

                      Good call.
 
              JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a
              joint.

              a bare chest, hiking boots and beat-up cowboy hat.  This is
              STEVE CHRISTY.  He is strong, charming, and engaging.  He is
              animated, always in motion, impatient with how long it takes to
              do things.
 
              In the BG the van comes to a stop.  No sooner has JACK hopped
              down, than STEVE is beckoning him over.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Wanta give me a hand here?
 
              JACK smiles and comes quickly.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Alice?
 
              NED steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had
              polio when he was a kid.  His upper body is strong, but his
              legs are slightly deformed.  He and MARCIE hustle over to the
              big stump.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
                      Alice?
 
              ALICE comes into the MS.  She is carrying a shovel and a bucket
              and has obviously been working for a couple of hours.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Cabin B is ready.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack,
                      Marcie and Ned.  Push.
 
              They exchange "hellos" as they bend to the work.

                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve
                      Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
                      You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into
                      'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out
                      the boathouse.  I want him to start with
                      the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?
 
                                  ALICE
                      You told her to sweep the courts.
 
              STEVE sets off.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks.
 
              As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE.
 
                                  NED
                      I thought we had two weeks...
 
              ALICE shrugs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You can changed in three.

              The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull
              up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing
              a coat of paint on the last canoe.
 
              BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his
              long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone
              call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the
              trail.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Steve said for you to start on the boats.
 
                                  BILL
                      I finished the boats.
 
              ALICE nods slowly.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'll tell him.
 
              She turns away.

                                  BILL
                      Alice?  The others show up?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Everybody except the girl who's supposed
                      to handle the kitchen.  Annie.
 
              BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps.
 
              ALICE look at him, then turns again.
 
                                  BILL
                      You think you're gonna last all summer?
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not sure I'll last all week.
                            (pauses)
                      I'll tell Steve.

        34    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - DAY
 
              STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a
              dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting
              the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking
              paint.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Shim it up just a scooch.
 
              NED levers the door higher at the top.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      Perfection.  Hold it.
 
              STEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      To answer your question, my parents once
                      owned this camp.  There were some tragic
                      accidents and they went bankrupt.  I
                      promised them I'd reopen if I could.
                      See if it closes right now.
 
              NED swings the door on its hinges.
 
                                  NED
                      Looks good.

                                  STEVE
                      Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?
 
              BRENDA turns and nods.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (continuing)
                      She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And
                      I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned.
 
              They exit with the tool box.  MARCIE stops and turns to BRENDA,
              who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead.

              STEVE, ALICE, BRENDA, MARCIE, NED, JACK and BILL are lugging a
              swimming float down to the water's edge.  STEVE supervises as
              he carries the thing, which is quite heavy.  They ad-lid as
              appropriate.  ("There goes my hernia." "Are you sure you're
              lifting?" "Not so fast." "I'm walking backward.")
 
              They drop the things carefully.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Come on back here and let's above the
                      float in.
 
              They get behind it and shove it into the water.  NED hops
              aboard for the ride, flipping into a handstand.

              The screen has gone completely black.  The door to the shed is
              whipped open quickly, letting in the full brightness of the
              sun.  There is a shape.
 
              The CAMERA IRISES DOWN so that we can see that JACK has come in
              on an errand.
 
              As JACK looks around, we can take the time to see that there
              are a half-dozen lantern, a few cans of lantern fuel, a couple
              of hibachis, some entrenching tools packs, portable ice chests,
              etc.  Up on the long side wall are a half-dozen hunting knives
              in sheathes, also hanging neatly.
 
              Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the
              shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.  JACK turns with
              a start.  He looks into the CAMERA.

              REVERSE POV to see MARCIE standing in the doorway.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      What are those for?  An Indian raid?
 
              She points to the row of hatchets and knives.
 
                                  JACK
                      Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see
                      any life rings?
 
              MARCIE looks behind some piled up equipment.  She pulls out two
              rings.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps.
                      Okay, Camper?
 
              She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose.
 
                                  JACK
                      For sure.
 
              They exit together.

              STEVE CHRISTY comes upon ALICE, who is renailing floorboards on
              the porch of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  On the railing is a
              sketch pad which Steve thumbs through.
 
              INSERT:  ALICE'S SKETCH.  It is a moody pierce, a sense of
              foreboding dominates it.  Otherwise, it is the camp's central
              compound, featuring the tree that forms the central focus.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You draw very well.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more
                      time at it.
 
              ALICE misses a nail and hits her thumb.  She reacts good-
              naturedly and keeps on working.
 
              STEVE bends down next to ALICE.
 
                                  STEVE
                      This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
 
              She shakes her head.

                            (continuing)
                      Any particular reason?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Just a feeling.
                            (pause)
                      Nothing personal.

                                  ALICE
                      I don't know.  Probably be best for
                      everybody.
 
                                  STEVE
                      You may not care a lot about this place,
                      Alice, but I mean to make it my whole
                      life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme
                      a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it
                      ready.  Next Friday, if you're not
                      happy, I'll put you on the bus myself.
                      I'll be grateful.
 
              He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek.
 
              She looks up.  She nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Next Friday.

                      Thanks, Alice.
 
              He stands up.

                      I'll be back around ten.  If you're
                      still up, we can talk, okay?

                      Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the
                      archery range.  If Annie gets here, have
                      her start in on the kitchen.  Do your
                      best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary
                      inspection by the state safety people.
                      I'd like to look good.
 
              He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others
              stand looking before NED breaks the silence.

              BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She
              enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of
              this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated
              than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
 
              BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
              and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are
              already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far.
              The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job.
 
              The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
              closer to setting up the target.
 
              In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the
              face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
              weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
              streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
              eighteen inches.
 
              BRENDA whips around.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-
              to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked
              simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair.
 
              She grabs the arrow and storms at him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You're crazy!
 
              She snaps the arrow in half.
 
                                  NED
                      Did anyone ever tell you you're
                      beautiful when you're angry?
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (plussed)
                      I don't believe you...
 
                                  NED
                      Want to see my trick shot?  It's even
                      better.
 
              BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's
              little she can do.  She laughs.
 
                                  BRENDA
                            (still laughing)
                      You ever fire one of those bows again,
                      and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.

                                  NED
                      God, but I love that sexy talk.
 
              BRENDA snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the
              bow down next to a collection of wicked-looking arrows.

              This is a fairly large single room.  The walls are bare and
              uninsulated.  There are a few easels, but for the most part,
              the room is dominated by long tables and rough-hewn benches.
 
              The light seeps through the streaked windows, making the grey
              wood interior appear silver-colored.  ALICE, her hair in a
              bandana, has just finished sweeping up.
 
              The CAMERA picks up on ALICE's sketch of the central camp area
              on one easel.  On a second easel she has done the preliminary
              sketch of the lake itself.  It is also a moody picture.
 
              ALICE cocks her head to look at the sketches, shivers just a
              little, then goes on to her next task.  There is a row of newly-
              arrived cardboard boxes.  She opens the first in CU with a
              matte knife.  She take out the invoice and checks it against
              the first items:  gimp, the plastic string from which all the
              campers will make lanyards.

              We watch through one of the dusty panes, seeing the charcoal
              sketch in the FG, ALICE in the BG checking her materials
              against her invoice.

              ALICE snaps around, sensing that she is being watched.  In CU
              her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.  Her
              face relaxes until BANG!  The sound of a door slamming echoes
              through the room.
 
              The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK from her face to see someone standing in
              the doorway.
 
              It is BILL.

                                  BILL
                      Sorry.  How you doing?
 
              ALICE smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory.
              BILL watches her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Did you want something?
 
              She starts to take a box down from a high shelf.  She doesn't
              realize that there is something on top of the box.
 
                                  BILL
                      Steve said you were thinking of leaving.
                      True?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Un-hunh.
 
              ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working
              tools clatters down, shattering the silence.  ALICE fends off
              the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.
 
                                  ALICE

                                  BILL
                      You okay?
 
              She nods.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      You're lucky.
 
              They stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor.
              BILL looks at her while they work.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      How come you're leaving?
 
                                  ALICE
                      It's long and personal.  It has nothing
                      to do with you or the other kids.
 
                                  BILL
                      Maybe I can help?
 
              ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if
              naive, young man.

                                  ALICE
                      And it's this place.  It makes no sense,
                      but it spooks me.
 
                                  BILL
                            (smiling)
                      You're right.  It makes no sense.
 
              As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.

              MARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the
              CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are
              bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by
              JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The
              screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for
              effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more
              or less for a frolic in the lake.
 
              BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL
              is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused.

              At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of
              the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They
              are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no
              real attempt to exert too much energy.
 
              Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's
              POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held,
              on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight.
 
              Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally,
              we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush.

              The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place
              alongside Alice's cabin.  There is underbrush about two feet
              tall and all around that area.  The PROWLER stops, leans down
              and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
 
              The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a
              burlap bag which has been secreted there.  The hand lifts the
              bag, which has something in it that moves.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below
              the window.  The window is open, making entry quite simple.

              The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in
              and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake.  One hand has the
              animal firmly behind the jaws.  The hand takes the snake and
              puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white
              coverlet.  It slithers across the bed.
 
              The PROWLER's hand closes the window.
 
              The CAMERA MOVES towards one of the sheds.

                      I just wasn't ready for that kind of

                      When I got back there, he sent a telegram
                      saying he was going back to his wife.
 
              BILL turns over so he can look at her better.

        51    EXT. BEHIND THE MAIN CABIN - DAY
 
              Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area.  There
              are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's
              an aging set of parallel bars.  There is even a set of weights
              made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.
 
              ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression.  He
              explodes his breath.
 
              We PULL BACK to see BRENDA watching NED work out on the uneven
              parallel bars.  He is really very good and there is no doubt
              about his strength.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Not bad.
 
              As NED moves off the apparatus, BRENDA comes in and does a neat
              little turn which is dazzling.  NED does a take.
 
                                  NED
                      Holy shit...

              The sun has dropped lower on the horizon.
 
              The CAMERA looks down on ALICE as she sleeps peacefully in the
              late sun.  A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with
              a start.
 
              CUT BACK to see BILL standing over her with a machete.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I didn't know I was asleep...What time
                      is it?

                                  ALICE
                      Now I'm only eleven hours behind
                      schedule.  Steve is going to have a

              ALICE is walking quicker than BILL.  We realize we have seen
              this cabin before--when the snake was placed in it.
 
                                  BILL
                      You can only do what you can do.
 
                                  ALICE
                      And then Steve looks at you with those
                      hurt eyes--like you don't care about
                      children...
 
              BILL laughs at her imitation.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      I'll see you later.
 
              She turns to go up the steps to her front door.
 
                                  BILL
                      Alice?
 
              She stops and look down at him.  He is serious and he cares.

              ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard.  She knows that it
              wasn't easy for BILL to say.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're very nice.
 
              They share a short silent moment.
 
                                  BILL
                      Hope you will.
 
              BILL smiles and turns and jogs off, still carrying his long
              blade.
 
              ALICE watches him go.  She shrugs.  This might be a good place
              to stay.  She turns and goes into her cabin.

              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
 
              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
 
              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
 
              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
 
              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
 
              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
 
              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

              ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a
              towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for
              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.
 
              She hums.  Opens her top drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              Opens the next drawer.  Nothing there.
 
              ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes!  It flails
              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
 
              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

                      Help!
 
              BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to

              MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG.

              ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and
              get her.
 
              BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks
              at ALICE.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a tight whisper)
                      There's a fucking snake in here.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
              machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto
              the floor.
 
              MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
              MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
              to see the blood and guts.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack,
                      would you get some paper towels?
 
              JACK nods and exits.
 
                                  ALICE

                      Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of
                      your perfume.
 
              JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      You okay now?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
              BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly,
              stepping on MARCIE's big toe.
 
                                  MARCIE

                            (to JACK)
                      Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
 
              JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets
              underneath the wide-fanged snake.

              toweling.

              The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but
              there is something standing there out by a cabin.  But it
              stands, doesn't move... Is it a building?

                   you need if you mix them      to all of you guys.  It's

                      The squaws are revolting!
 
              ALICE looks up.  Pulls the light cord in the middle of the room.
 
              The bulb does not light.
 
              ALICE pulls it again.
 
                                  BILL
                      Trouble?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bad bulb or no power.  It's getting a
                      little gloomy in here.
 
                                  JACK
                      Steve taught me how to use the emergency
                      generator.  The town power lines are
                      supposed to be real shitty.

                                  NED
                      God, but I love that macho talk!
                      Emergency generators!  The Indian used
                      campfires.
 
              JACK turns to BILL.
 
                                  JACK
                      Give me a hand?
 
                                  BILL
                      For sure.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is
              standing.  The puddle is somehow significant.
 
              BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing.
 
                                  BILL
                      This is almost like the one at my
                      uncle's cabin in Maine.
 
                                  JACK
                      Here we go.
 
              The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we
              see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he
              concentrates.  He bites down on it.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine
              roars into action.
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Now ya' close the switch.
 
              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
 
              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON
 
              JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and
              cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his
              breathing.
 
              JACK shakes his head.
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
 
                                  BILL
                      Don't get up.  Take a second...
 
              JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm.
 
                                  JACK
                      You saved my life.
 
                                  BILL
                      I had to.
 
                                  JACK
                      Thanks.
 
                                  BILL
                      I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd
                      have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that
                      would have ruined my appetite.
 
              JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy
              athlete gets to his feet.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whew.
 
              Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and
              looks in.
 
              We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred
              switch and a now-silent generator.
 
                                  BILL
                      This puddle was enough to ground you all
                      the way to China.
 
              JACK looks in, too.

                                  JACK
                      Floor probably leaks.  This area is full
                      of springs.
 
                                  BILL
                      A short somewhere.
 
              BILL leans down and sees a smokey-colored wire that touches
              another wire.
 
                                  BILL
                            (continuing)
                      There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked
                      itself loose.
 
              He starts to wind it round a set-screw in CU.
 
                                  JACK
                      Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm
                      gonna pick up some lanterns from the
                      equipment shack.
 
              JACKS walks away.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        63    INT. EQUIPMENT SHED - DUSK
 
              The door opens at us, letting in the limited light.  JACK comes
              in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp.  He flicks it on.
              As he bends down to pick up two Coleman lanterns, the CAMERA
              slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets
              and knives.  They are all missing.
 
              JACK takes his booty and exits.
 
              The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        64    INT. KITCHEN - DUSK
 
              ECU of the lightbulb over the kitchen area.  It flickers on as
              we hear in the BG the sound of the generator start up.  The
              bulb glows, goes down, glows cheerily.

                      That was the telephone.

                                  NED
                      Ha!  You wily oriental!  The phone was
                      "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."
                      "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
 
              JACK comes in with his lanterns followed by BILL.

                      Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
 
              ALICE listens as she washes the dishes.  It looks as if things
              will be okay.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Shows how much you know.  It's something
                      about tomorrow.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Tomorrow is another day.

              MARCIE is finishing up making her green California dip.
 
              Suddenly ALICE cries out.  Everybody whips around to see.
              ALICE holds up a piece of broken glass--the bottom half of a
              bottle.  She has cut her finger.  It is not a serious cut, but
              the blood is visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      This just plain ain't my day.
 
              BILL reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a BandAid.
 
                           MARCIE                        NED
                   You okay?                     Those things can be nasty.
 
                           BRENDA
                   Wash it out real good.
 
              BILL comes up to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
 
              That said, the OTHERS go back to what they were doing.
 
              BILL and ALICE are featured even though we can hear the others.
              BILL takes great care and puts the BandAid on ALICE's finger.

              They share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest
              continues.

                           ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my
                   I was careless.               guaranteed winner!
 
                           BILL                          MARCIE
                   How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli?
 
                           ALICE
                   Somebody probably dropped
                   something too hard.
 
                                  NED
                      Alice, you're just lucky there are no
                      snakes in the dishwater here.
 
              NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE
              has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
 
              Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs
              his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it.
 
                                  JACK
                      What is it?
 
                                  BILL
                      Is it stuck?
 
              NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he
              writhes about.
 
                           MARCIE                        ALICE
                   Help him!                     Oh, my God!
 
                           BILL                          JACK
                   Roll him over!                Get behind him more.
 
              As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich,
              NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish:
 
                                  NED
                      Ta-da!

              REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
 
                                  JACK
                      Not funny, Ned...
 
              BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Wait'll you're really in trouble and see
                      what happens...
 
                                  NED
                      But it's in the brochure!  "Camp Crystal
                      Lake has a full drama program."  You
                      just saw it.
 
              NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE
              walks away.  JACK looks at BILL.
 
                                  BILL
                      Chance to get even?
 
                                  JACK
                      I'll spot you five points.
 
                                  NED
                      Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it
                      again.
 
              NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him.
              The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little
              ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting
              stunt.
 
                                  NED
                            (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Ned?  We're gonna be working together
                      for a while.  You're a nice guy without
                      all the entertainment, okay?
 
              NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look
              at the others.
 
                                  NED
                      Tell 'em I'm sorry?
 
              ALICE nods.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Sure.

                                  NED
                      I'm gonna go lie down and catch some
                      z's.  Today wiped me out.
                            (pause)
                      Thanks, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      You're welcome.
 
              The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG,
              MARCIE speaks.

                      I hope that's the last time we see the
                      Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.

              We watch NED come away from the main cabin and walk moodily
              toward his cabin.
 
              The CAMERA stays with the troubled child as he stops, leans
              down, picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush.  It
              cuts through.  He flips a few stones in his hand.
 
              NED looks off.  Sees something.
 
              WE SEE WHAT HE SEES:  a shape--a human shape--standing by a
              cabin.
 
              NED walks towards it.
 
                                  NED
                      Hello?  Can I help you?

              ALICE is just drying her hands.  She stands next to a giant
              stack of clean dishes and pots.
 
              BRENDA is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower
              and cucumber slices.
 
              BILL and JACK saunter in.
 
                                  JACK
                      You just had some lucky shots.

                                  BILL
                      Where's Ned?
 
                                  ALICE
                      He went to bed early.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I don't blame him.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      He's probably setting up another one of
                      his practical jokes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Yeah, like draining the lake!
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  JACK
                            (to MARCIE)
                      Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
 
              The OTHERS all go "Ooooooooh."
 
                                  JACK
                            (continuing)
                      Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (kidding)
                      Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy
                      small-minded people around here.
                            (to JACK)
                      Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and
                      be right with you.
 
              MARCIE puts an arm through JACK's arm and they exit.
 
              The OTHERS laugh.

        67    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - NIGHT
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk across the pint needles towards the lake.
              There is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on
              the horizon.
 
              JACK and MARCIE walk along the shore to the lake.  They have
              turned on the flashlights which they carry with them.

                                  JACK
                      Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred
                      and eighty degrees.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
 
                                  JACK
                      I love you.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I love you.
 
              They kiss.  MARCIE pulls back.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      What about Neddy?
 
                                  JACK
                      I don't love Neddy.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
 
                                  JACK
                            (yelling)
                      Ned!
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Don't call him.
 
                                  JACK
                      I thought you wanted to give him one of
                      your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do
                      whatever he wants to do, you know.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I guess...
 
              The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light.
 
                                  JACK
                      Looks like a storm.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I'm a little scared of storms.  Always
                      have been.  Since I was a kid.
 
                                  JACK
                      You?  The brick?
 
              JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie
              shadows.  She flashes hers at him.

                                  MARCIE
                      I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a
                      dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm.
                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears
                      off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets
                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
 
              A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is
              startled and reaches out for her lover.
 
                                  JACK
                      It's just a dream.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      I call it my shower dream.
 
              They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain
              drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them.
 
                                  JACK
                      This is no dream.  Want to escape for a
                      while?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Lead the way!
 
              JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only
              a half step behind, laughing.
 
              FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme,
              just the rumble of thunder...

              The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and
              JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the
              nearest bed.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Are you wet?
 
                                  JACK
                      Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman.
 
              He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points
              straight up and gives them some light to see by.

              They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's
              hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up
              towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses
              it at the CAMERA.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
 
              The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the
              front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
 
                                  BILL
                      Not if they're where I think they are.
 
              ALICE laughs.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I'm not always this stupid.
 
              She turned back into the cabin.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        70    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              TIGHT on JACK and MARCIE as they make love under a camp
              blanket.  Their breathing and noises are heard just above the
              sounds of the rain outside.
 
              The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have
              leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and
              dribbled down.  As the bed shakes with its love-making, the
              CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.
 
              As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see
              NED lying in the upper bunk.  In a flash of lightning we
              realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath
              their blanket.  The CAMERA PANS along their quiet bodies.
              MARCIE's face is contented.  JACK is ready to doze off.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Mmmmmmmph?
 
                                  JACK
                      Mmmmmmmph.

                                  MARCIE
                      Best over...
 
                                  JACK
                      Umhummmmph.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Like waves.  It's never been likes waves
                      before.
 
                                  JACK
                      Whassamatta?
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
 
              She rolls over and grabs her underpants and t-shirt.  While
              still on the bottom bunk, she puts herself into her limited
              clothing.  JACK gives her room.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (dressing)
                      I know this ain't very romantic, but
                      what can I say?  I don't want to explode.
 
              She grabs a flashlight, scoots to the door and is gone.
 
              JACK lies back and puts his hands under his hand.

              MARCIE runs across the now-wet central area towards the
              bathroom facility.  She tries to skip between the raindrops,
              but she knows she'll get a drenching.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
        72    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT
 
              JACK rolls to his side, picks up a small hand-rolled cigarette
              and lights it.  He inhales deeply, rolls on his back.
              Something overhead catches his eye.
 
              Across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower
              stalls, and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors.
              We hear the toilet flush.
 
              We CUT INSIDE the toilet booth as MARCIE stands reading the
              graffiti to herself.  We can only see her from the chest up.

                                  MARCIE
                            (reading)
                      "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie
                      Makit."  "The Yellow Stream by I.P.
                      Daley."  Not the most original stuff,
                      kids.
 
              There is a noise outside the stall.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?
 
              She hears no response and assumes that her imagination is
              playing tricks with her.  MARCIE picks up the flashlight and
              exits the stall.
 
        73    MARCIE crosses to the row of sinks, stops, puts the
              flashlight down and turns on the water faucet.  There is
              no water.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
              PROWLER'S POV:  of MARCIE.
 
              From the end of the row of showers, we watch MARCIE bend under
              the sink and turn on one of the spigots.  Water rushes into the
              sink.
 
        74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and
              turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks
              to the row of showers and smiles.
 
                                  MARCIE
                      Jack?
 
              The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
 
              MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to
              scare her.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
 
              There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower,
              hesitates.
 
              Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She
              reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off.
 
              She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the
              empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain.

                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Allee allee infree!
 
              She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there.
 
              She breathes a sigh of disappointment.
 
                                  MARCIE
                            (continuing)
                      Must be my imagination.
 
              In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the
              TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash.
              A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first
              shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet

              The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an
              establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are
              being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS
              seated on stools at the counter.

        76    INT. DINER - NIGHT
 
              The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly
              older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her
              CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the
              counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of
              coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and
              tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Anything else you want?
 
                                  STEVE
                      No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy.
 
                                  SANDY
                      You can't go back there tonight.  Not in
                      that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded.
 
                                  STEVE
                            (drinking quickly)
                      I got to.

                                  SANDY
                      Aw.
 
              SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I have six new counsellor up there.
                      They're all babes in the woods in every
                      sense of the word.
 
                                  SANDY
                      They'll be okay if they know enough to
                      stay in outta the rain.
 
 
                      How much do I owe you?
 
                                  SANDY
                      One night on the town.
 
                                  STEVE
                      I mean...
 
                                  SANDY
                      ...I know what you mean.  Two and a
                      quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to
                      make up for me spending the night alone.
 
              STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register.
 
                                  SANDY
                            (continuing)
                      You got a roof for that Jeep?
 
              She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a
              tip.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Yeah.  I got it on before this--
                            (indicates the storm outside)
                      --all started.
 
                                  SANDY
                      That's thirty percent.
 
                                  STEVE
                      For two lonely nights.
 
              She smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that
              extra makeup.
 
                                  SANDY
                      Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb
                      self.

              STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes
              and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.

              The rain continues as STEVE exits the diner, gets in his Jeep
              and starts it up.  He roars off through a big puddle, splashing
              water towards the CAMERA.  The Jeep pulls a small equipment
              trailer.

              PROWLER'S POV:  From outside the cabin, we can see some
              activity in the big meeting room.  The CAMERA moves slightly
              from left to right as the shot is established.  Then an unseen
              hand releases a branch which partially blocks the shot.

              ALICE enters from the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee.
              She hands one to BRENDA, who is curled up on the couch in front
              of the fire.  BILL stands to the left of the hearth, picks up
              a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      You think they fell asleep?
 
                                  BILL
                      Anything's possible.  My parents taught
                      me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      It wouldn't matter except Steve should be
                      getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't
                      look so great if he fell over them.

                                  BILL
                      Good point.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Well, it hasn't been that long.
 
              BRENDA smiles.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Long enough for me.
 
              They laugh.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I think we should go wake them up.  Just
                      in case.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Give them a little while longer.  It's
                      still early, anyway.

              Lighted by dash panel, STEVE tries to concentrate on seeing the
              road.  He leans forward, rubs a cloth on the windshield to get
              rid of the condensation.
 
              From his POV we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay
              ahead of the rain.  Beyond them the headlights make a slight
              dent in the night.
 
              In the BG we hear a country station on the radio, but it is
              bringing in more static than music, owing to the electrical
              storm.
 
              STEVE's hand reaches in and shuts off the radio.

              off his poncho and stamps his feet.
 
                                  BILL
                      Got to it just in time.  The generator
                      was running on fumes.  I filled it up.
                      That should keep it humming until Steve
                      gets back.
 
              BRENDA gets up.
 
                                  BRENDA
                      Good night, Alice.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Good night, Brenda.
 
              BRENDA takes her lantern, and, throwing the slicker over her
              head like a portable tent, she races off into the night.
 
              ALICE watches her go.  A glimmer of lightning outlines her as
              she heads off.
 
              BILL walks back into the big room, followed by ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Help you clean up?

              into the kitchen.

              BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in
              the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an
              examination lamp.  She takes out a toothbrush and some other
              toilet articles.
 
              She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out.  She put her
              lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves.  She
              stands up, and washes her hands and face.

              She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound
              that Marcie had heard.  BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls,
              shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.

              mirror.

              flag down the oncoming car.

                      I think water got into the electrical

                      That could drive a person bug-city.
 
              The SOUND is apparently coming from the front of the cabin;
              perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet.
 
              BRENDA grabs her slicker and heads out.
 
              The CAMERA FOLLOWS BRENDA through the darkened cabin to the

              ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER:  as BRENDA hears the tapping sound
              closer by.  She looks and sees.
 
              WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a
              string and left it dangling from the eaves.  The wind blows,
              making the knife tap against the building.

                                  BRENDA
                      Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!

              BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a

              revealing something that has been left there.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face.
 
              REVERSE POV:  WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  A camp hatchet lies across
              her pillow.  The shiny blade is marked with blood.
 
              BRENDA turns and runs from her room.

              BRENDA runs through the rain, her flimsy pajamas drenched.  Her
              bare feet slip in the mud.  She heads for a small rise that
              leads to the softball field.

              The softball field is now lit.  BRENDA is confused.  She looks
              off behind the backstop.  Then to center field.  Confused, she
              runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind
              third base.  The CAMERA slowly zooms in on the darkness where
              BRENDA exited.  We hold on that spot for several seconds.
              Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.  Then
              another.

                      Can't hear anything through that wind
                      and rain.

                                  ALICE
                      It sounded like Brenda.
 
                                  BILL
                      I'll go take a look.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Did somebody leave the lights on at the
                      softball field?
 
              We are looking over at her shoulder.  The distant glimmer
              suddenly goes dark.  BILL joins her and looks.
 
                                  BILL
                      Where?

                      They're off now.
 
              BILL heads for the door.
 
                                  BILL
                      I'll go check on Brenda.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Okay.
 
              ALICE turns.  BILL is halfway out the door.

                      I think we should call the police, Bill.
 
              BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods
              and turns back to ALICE.
 
                                  BILL
                      Okay.
 
              They exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape
              passes between us and the night sky light which comes through
              the windows.  The shape is dragging something.

              ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the
              left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office."  BILL
              tries the door, but cannot open it.

                      Sucker's locked.  Who's got the key?
 
              ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and
              comes up with a short 2x4.  She crosses to the door and smashes
              through one of the window panes.  She puts her arm through the
              broken glass, unlocks the door and enters.  BILL follows.
 
              The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
              They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's
              desk.  BILL picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch
              on the desk set several times.
 
                                  BILL

                      It's dead.  Try the pay phone.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Do you have a dime?  A quarter?
 
                                  BILL
                      No.  There must be some in the desk
                      somewhere.
 
              They fumble through the desk to find some change.  BILL finds
              some in the postage drawer.  He then crosses over to a pay
              phone mounted on the wall.  The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
              the building where the phone line exits.  It follows the link
              up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and
              phone lines come in from the pole.  Here we see a dangling
              phone cable which has been recently cut.

              OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead
              telephone.

              ALICE hops in on the passenger side.
 
              BILL turns over the engine.  It grinds away but does not catch.
 
              From an ANGLE behind the outside mirror, we hear the engine
              fail to catch.  We look in the mirror and see someone standing
              in the distance, watching.
 
              BILL gets out of the driver's side.  Slams the door.  The
              CAMERA TRUCKS with him as he opens the door to the engine.
              ALICE joins him as he shines his light on the engine.

                            (continuing)
                      Don't worry.  There is probably some
                      really stupid explanation for all this.
                      When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll
                      smile.
                            (pause)
                      Promise.
 
              ALICE nods.

              In the FG we see a camp sign.  In the BG we see a figure
              running towards us.
 
              The figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as STEVE
              CHRISTY.  Just as he's about to make the turn into the
              driveway, he looks up and smiles.  He stops and catches his
              breath as the other person catches him in the light of a
              flashlight.
 
                                  STEVE
                      Hi.  What are you doing out in this mess?
 
              He shields his eyes from the light.

       112    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG,
              ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front
              of her is a large machete.

              BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts
              to doze again.
 
              The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out.
 
              BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks
              it on.
 
                                  BILL
                      Oh, shit....
 
              He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some
              lanterns.  He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong
              table.
 
              BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits,
              carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp.
 
              HOLD on ALICE's peaceful face as she slumbers.

              The rain has lessened a bit.  BILL approaches the shed with his
              fluorescent lamp and rifle.  He has the rifle at the ready.
 
              CU on his hand on the door handle.  He pulls it open.

              The generator stands there quietly.  BILL comes into view,
              spraying the interior with lamplight.
 
              In the FG a broken sparkplug which BILL does not see immediately.
              It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer.
 
              BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks
              in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on.
 
              Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug.
              He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He
              puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed.

              ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid.

                                  ALICE
                      Bill?!
 
              She gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks
              at the bulb overhead.  Pulls its string.  No light.
 
              She sees the lanterns which have been placed around.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      The generator...
 
              Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a
              little.  Smiles.  She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern,
              and walks into the kitchen.

       116    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea
              kettle with water.  She puts it on the stove and pops on a
              burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee.
 
              Impatient and curious, she walks to the front door of the cabin
              and looks out.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?  Bill?
 
              The calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning
              to desert her.

              ALICE takes the kettle off the flame.
 
              The whistling stops abruptly.  ALICE pours water into the two
              cups.  She stirs the coffee.
 
              Unable to contain her impatience any longer, ALICE picks up her
              lantern, grabs a slicker, and heads out the door.

       119    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE walks very quickly around the side of the cabin, headed
              for the generator shed.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill!

       120    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT
 
              The door to the shed is closed.  ALICE looks around and then
              puts a hand on the hand.  In CU we see the hand pull.  The door
              doesn't budge.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE decides to pull harder.
 
              She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs.  She pulls
              until she finally wrenches the door open.  The lamp casts long
              shadows upwards.
 
              The generator sits silent.
 
              ALICE leans into the shed to look.
 
              The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can
              see behind the right-hand corner of the building.  As we clear
              the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down
              from a branch above.
 
              The something turns slowly in the wind.  It is BILL--dead--in
              a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
 
              ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill?
 
              She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE.  She is riveted with horror, unable to
              move or turn or run.  The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME,
              the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
 
              ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.  She
              turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main
              cabin.

                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      Help!  Help!

                      Jack!  Marcie!  Help me!

       122    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
 
              ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete.
              It is not there.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The knife!
 
              She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
 
              LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the
              couch.
 
              ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the
              lamp.
 
              Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a
              window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass,
              shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
 
              It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
 
              ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front
              door.
 
              ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited
              figure.
 
              ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
 
              When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early
              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long
              enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently,
              pointing back to the rear window.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't
                      help you if you can't talk to me.
                      There, there now...
 
              ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see
              the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible.
 
                                  ALICE
                      He's dead... She's dead... all dead...
                      Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh
                      my God, oh my God... oh God...
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It will be all right.  I'll take care of
                      you.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Jack?  Marcie?  Ned?
 
              MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It's just this place.  The storm.
                      That's why you're all upset.
 
                                  ALICE
                      No, no, they're all dead...
 
              ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table
              without looking.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'll go look.
 
              ALICE's face registers the new terror.
 
                                  ALICE
                      They'll kill you!  Don't leave me!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I'm not afraid.
 
              ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to
              the back window.
 
                                  ALICE
                      All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie...

              ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body
              sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      Oh, my lord...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table,
              she picks up the lantern.
 
              ALICE waits at the fireplace.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      So young, so pretty.  What monster could
                      have done such a thing?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Bill--Bill--Bill is out there...
 
              She lets MRS. VOORHEES take her in her arms.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      We shall go straight to the police.
 
              ALICE backs up.
 
                                  ALICE
                      The killer is still out there.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      I will protect you.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES looks around the room.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Oh, this place... It should never have
                      been a camp.  Not for children.  They
                      had so much trouble here.
 
              The fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace.  A log burns
              through and rolls off, throwing up a small shower of sparks.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      Camp Blood.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has almost completely calmed the girl down.
              Strokes her soft hair.

                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      You know a boy drowned the year before
                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.
 
              ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MCU as the OLDER WOMAN's hand strokes the
              YOUNGER WOMAN's hair.  The hand is missing its little finger!
 
              The THEME enters upon the TRACK in a lyrical, child-like
              version, echoing back to another era, pretty and light.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      We should go now.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head gently.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No.  That won't be necessary.
 
              As she speaks, MRS. VOORHEES reaches into her slicker in a
              surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting
              knife.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I don't understand.
 
              MIXED on the TRACK, filtered, echoed and distant, is the SOUND
              of a ten year old boy, JASON, crying for help in a fantasy
              version of what might have happened when he drowned in 1957.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                            (filtered)
                      Help me, mommy... save me... please,
                      mommy... please, mommy... help me, mommy...
                      save me....
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (cocking her hand to listen)
                      I am, Jason.  I am.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (a little confused)
                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      It was my son they killed.  They said he
                      drowned, but I know it was inadequate
                      supervision...
 
              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the
              knife rise behind her.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Mr. Christy will be back soon.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                      No, he won't.  I killed him as well....
 
              The shock of recognition hits ALICE.  In CU her eyes look up
              and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready
              to strike.
 
              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the
              fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (continuing)
                      I couldn't let them start this camp
                      again, could I?
 
              ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace
              poker.
 
                                  ALICE
                      I won't let you!
 
              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.
 
                                  ALICE
                            (continuing)
                      No!  No!  No!
 
              MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife.
              ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib
              cage.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
 
              ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

              MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE
              deliberately.
 
              Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT
 
              ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of
              the screen... somebody has latched it.
 
              CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at
              the door, snapping the latch.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the
              thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as
              ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
 
              TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from
              above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of
              STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under
              his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade
              protrudes from his heart.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair
              of legs which swing from the same big tree.
 
              STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we
              see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance
              between herself and ALICE.

       124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE runs for the door, slams through it.
 
              The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT
 
              ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the
              SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three
              bright overhead lights come on.
 
              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
 
              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few
              feet.
 
              She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in
              CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Help, mommy, I'm drowning!  Oh, mommy,
                      please....
 
              The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of
              JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC.  She is both
              characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
 
              ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the
              VOICE OF JASON.
 
              ALICE is very still.  Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS.
              VOORHEES rave.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Don't let me die, mommy... I can't
                      breathe... Help me, breathe...
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.  She
              strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the
              child stops.
 
                                  MRS. VOORHEES
                            (in her own voice)
                      I can't let them kill any more children.
                      Come out now.
 
              She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her
              way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the
              PROWLER.
 
              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
 
              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
 
              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low
              animal bellow.
 
              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.
 
              ALICE gets to the door, shuts off the light switch and runs out.
 
              We can hear JASON'S VOICE.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her!

       127    EXT. CAMP GROUNDS/EQUIP. SHED - NIGHT
 
              The central area is bathed in light.  The rain has stopped.
              MRS. VOORHEES has turned on all the flood-lights.
 
              ALICE runs to the corner of one of the cabins.  She stops to
              look back.  MRS. VOORHEES is gaining on her.
 
              ALICE runs to the equipment shed.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  The door is thrown back.  ALICE goes in.  Looks
              for a weapon.  Nothing is available.  ALICE sobs with fear.
              She runs.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES passes the equipment shed.
 
                                                       CUT TO:

       128    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              A single bulb outside the building shows ALICE as she bursts
              through the door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       129    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              It is a small cabin.  On the walls are five .22 calibre rifles.
 
              ALICE runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles
              from the wall.
 
              She rummages in a drawer.  It's empty.  She tries another.
              Empty.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Where are the goddamned bullets?
 
              The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it.
 
              ALICE looks around.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the
              rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt
              stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She
              turns.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway,
              blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES
              steps slowly toward ALICE.
 
              ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only
              thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
              swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
              arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
              drops to the floor.

              ALICE runs out the door.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT
 
              ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the
              front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is
              no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs
              into the kitchen.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT
 
              ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide.
              She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and
              then hides there, closing the door behind her.
 
                                                       CUT TO:
 
 
       134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT
 
              There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
              ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
              which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
 
              ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
 
              As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
              Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are
              turned on.
 
                                  JASON (V.O.)
                      Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
                      please.  Kill her, mommy.
 
              There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the
              sound of another door being slammed.
 
              ALICE relaxes again.
 
              Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
              now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the
              idea.
 
              She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are
              the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large
              skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
 
              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
 
              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
 
                                  JASON (O.S.)
                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
 
              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
 
              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
 
                                  ALICE
                      Please...
 
              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
 
              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
 
              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
 
              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
 
              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
 
              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
 
              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
 
              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
 
              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.

              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.

              Exhausted, ALICE puts her paddle across her lap and falls
              forward, slumped across a thwart.

              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
 
              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.

       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
 
              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
 
              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
 
              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
 
              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
 
              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
 
              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
 
              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
 
                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
 
              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
 
              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
 
              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.

       139    EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING
 
              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
 
              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.
 
                                  1st INSPECTOR
                      Good morning, miss.

                            (Leaning across the front seat)
                      Are you all right, ma'am?
 
                                  ALICE
                      Help me.
 
              The CAMERA PANS BACK while the two men get out of their vehicle
              and come around to help ALICE.

              LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of
