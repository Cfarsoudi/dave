               FADE IN:

               UNDERWATER - DAY

               Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface.

               A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the 
               distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the 
               shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming 
               side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering 
               the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut-
               off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an 
               expensive camera with a flash attachment.

               One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it," 
               and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts 
               of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and 
               floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of 
               illumination.

               SEA BOTTOM - DAY

               The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly 
               under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these 
               four years.

               Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands 
               of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering 
               with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow 
               from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly 
               tangled.

               The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by 
               the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. 
               The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor 
               drive camera.

               ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW

               Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.

               SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA

               Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, 
               moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.

               An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues 
               snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.

               BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)

               Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes 
               a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, 
               f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.

               He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling 
               his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.

               Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.

               Something's out there, moving towards us.

               Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.

               Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, 
               Death.

               OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT

               The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A 
               dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash.

                                                         MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN

               Flash! An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag 
               fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor.

               Flash! A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us. The boat 
               rocks in the ceaseless swell.

               On the stern, "Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I." A long way from 
               home...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. A 
               figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent 
               mission. It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.

               The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs 
               leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet 
               solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a 
               door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a 
               hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of 
               a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in 
               progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity 
               Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School 
               band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet 
               player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd 
               applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some 
               dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity 
               Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that 
                         eloquent solo. Now, for that point 
                         in the ceremonies where we formally 
                         dedicate this magnificent resort-
                         hotel complex, a worthwhile addition 
                         to the recreational paradise we call 
                         Amity.

               ANGLE ON THE DAIS

               Seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several 
               of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson, 
               and Ellen Brody, very chic. Brody slips into the vacant chair 
               next to her. The following is conducted in urgent whispers, 
               sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on.

                                     ELLEN
                         Where the hell were you?

                                     BRODY
                         Late.

                                     ELLEN
                         I can see that. Don't you know this 
                         is a big deal?

                         BRODY
                 Couldn't help it. 
                 Hendricks over there...
                    (he indicates his 
                    deputy)
                 ...still has the keys 
                 to the jeep in his 
                 pocket, and I couldn't 
                 find the spares.

                         ELLEN
                 Terrific. Act as if 
                 you've been here all 
                 along.

                         BRODY
                 How'm I supposed to do 
                 that?

                         ELLEN
                 Look bored. 

                                                       VAUGHN

                                               the action is... We've had 
                                               our share of hard times 
                                               and long winters and the 
                                               past few years have not 
                                               been easy. But today, the 
                                               sun is rising on a new 
                                               Amity, a new island filled 
                                               with promise.

                                               Development is an exciting 
                                               addition to our island.

                                               in is likewise a new friend 
                                               who we welcome as family. 
                                               Amity means 'friendship' 
                                               and our community extends

                                                  (applause)

               Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a 
               wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his 
               idea of civilian finery. Hendricks is fussing with the banner 
               on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit...

               ANGLE ON VAUGHN

                                     VAUGHN
                         ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's 
                         Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that 
                         officially opens this luxurious new 
                         hotel...

               Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks' 
               attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon, 
               while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Tina was selected from more than 20 
                         of this island's lovely young
                         ladies in the Miss Amity competition 
                         held every spring, and she'll 
                         represent Amity Island in the Miss 
                         Massachusetts Competition in Worcester 
                         next month. When she cuts this ribbon, 
                         she will be opening our island to 
                         growth, to development, to planned 
                         expansion with full employment for 
                         our thriving community.

               ANGLE ON THE BAND

               Paul Lohman ("Polo" to his friends) is exchanging whispers 
               with Lucy, a flute player nearby.

                                     LUCY
                         I don't think she's such hot stuff.

                                     POLO
                         When are we going out? You and me?

                                     LUCY
                         Not tonight.

                                     POLO
                         You going with Patrick?

               Lucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby.

                                     POLO
                         Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as 
                         soon as we get out of these monkey 
                         suits?

               She nods happily, they whisper together, while we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON DAIS

               Martin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son, 
               Sean.

                                     SEAN
                         Mom, Michael won't talk to me.

                              (to Ellen)
                         Shouldn't he be at home?

                                     ELLEN
                         Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.

                                     VAUGHN
                         This money tree, you may have noticed, 
                         is made entirely of twenty-dollar 
                         bills, donated by Len Peterson, the 
                         builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, 
                         as a gesture of goodwill towards the 
                         community. $500 as a special gift to 
                         the Amity township scholarship fund...

               Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (prompting)
                         Go ahead, Tina.

               ANGLE ON TINA

               as she reaches out with the scissors. Something catches her 
               eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking 
               in the crowd. He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with 
               his fingers.

               ANGLE ON THE CEREMONY

               Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes 
               a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, 
               balloons drop from the ceiling.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua-
                         Sports, for contributing the special 
                         decorations. And now, the Amity High 
                         School band. Refreshments on the 
                         patio, everyone...

               The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to 
               dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HOLIDOME - LATER

               Ellen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry 
               Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation. They pass vignettes:

               Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting 
               Amity townspeople.

                                     BRODY
                              (seeing Peterson and 
                              Vaughn)
                         Do I have to talk to those two?

                                     ELLEN
                         My boss and your boss. Sure.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Hello, hello. It went well, I thought.

                                     BRODY
                         Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thank you, thank you. You know my 
                         son, don't you?

               He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young 
               man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer. They exchange 
               perfunctory greetings.

                                     PETERSON
                         The speech was right on the money.
                              (to Ellen)
                         Be a love and make sure the bar's 
                         open, will you?

               He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for 
               Brody's liking.

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Brody)
                         Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd 
                         do without her.

                                     BRODY
                         Me neither.

                                     PETERSON
                              (looking around)
                         Y'know, Brody -- for the first time 
                         in years it's worth putting money 
                         into this town.

                                     BRODY
                         All of us thank you, okay?

                                     ELLEN
                         Watch Sean for a minute?

               And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over-
               active 10 year old, while she's gone.

                                     SEAN
                         Can I go swimming?

                                     BRODY
                         No. Find your brother, okay?

               Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND

               He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a 
               pleasant face.

               Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby. A plumpish, curly-
               haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch.

                                     MIKE
                         How old is your cousin?

                                     BROOKE
                         Seventeen. She's a senior.

                                     MIKE
                         I'm not crazy about blind dates.

                                     ANDY
                         They're okay, if they got little 
                         white canes and tin cups.

                                     BROOKE
                         That's awful.

                                     ANDY
                         What the hell.
                              (to Mike)
                         Did your mom put all this together?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah, it's her job.

                                     ANDY
                         Is she responsible for the punch?

                                     MIKE
                         No.

                                     ANDY
                         Good. It's terrible.

                                     BROOKE
                         My cousin will be here tomorrow.

                                     MIKE
                         Great.

               Sean finds them, and bursts into their group.

                                     SEAN
                         Michael, Michael, Dad said to find 
                         you.

                                     ANDY
                         Okay, you did that.

                                     SEAN
                         Come on, Mikey, come on...

               He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged 
               off.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay, okay. Got to go.

               Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in.

                                     TIM
                              (to Brooke)
                         Want to dance?
                              (she shakes her head 
                              "no")
                         Okay. Later?

               On her shrug, as she turns to Andy:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT

               It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version 
               of "When I Fall in Love." Many teen-agers are dancing out on 
               the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is 
               ravaged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo.

               Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for 
               a dance and striking out.

                                     DOUG
                         Get a dance yet?

                                     TIMMY
                         Nope.

                                     DOUG
                         Me neither.

                                     TIMMY
                         Who'd you ask?

                                     DOUG
                         Tina Wilcox.

                                     TIMMY
                         You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.

                                     DOUG
                         Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the 
                         most beautiful girls are the 
                         loneliest.

                                     TIMMY
                         That's a crock of shit.

                                     DOUG
                         I know.

               Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up by 
               their side.

                                     BOB
                         Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?

                                     DOUG
                         The mayor?

                                     BOB
                         Larry Vaughn Junior?
                              (Doug shrugs)
                         If you see him, tell him I got a six-
                         pack, a blanket, and the Brebner 
                         twins.

               He exits, on the prowl.

                                     TIMMY
                         No class.

                                     DOUG
                         None at all.
                              (pause)
                         I wonder what the Brebner twins are 
                         doing tomorrow night.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN

                                     BRODY
                         Can you take a little time out from 
                         your busy schedule to dance with the 
                         old man?

                                     ELLEN
                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         Because they're playing our song.

               And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties 
               slow-dance standard: "I Wish You Love." Peterson approaches.

                                     PETERSON
                         May I have this dance?

                                     BRODY
                         Sorry, I'm all booked up...
                              (taking Ellen)
                         Come, m'dear.

               They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace. Both of them 
               nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows 
               the chief.

                                     BRODY
                         Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

                                     ELLEN
                         And how. I thought you wouldn't 
                         respect me.

                                     BRODY
                         I did, I did.

               The music and the summer moon are working their magic.

                                     BRODY
                         Listen -- what are you doing later?

                                     ELLEN
                         Fooling around?

                                     BRODY
                         Right.

               He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep 
               on a bench.

                                     ELLEN
                         Let's get the kid home.

                                     BRODY
                         Home it is.

               He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt.

                                     BRODY
                              (to the kid)
                         You're getting a little big for this.

               Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad. Mike, dancing with 
               Marge, waves good-bye. The Brodys start to leave, passing a 
               bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it. They exchange 
               a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle, sneaking 
               it out of the building while Ellen giggles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY

               Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early 
               morning light streams under the blinds. It's The Morning 
               After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered 
               all over the room. Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion, 
               morning-horny.

                                     BRODY
                         Mmmm.

                                     ELLEN
                         MMMmmmorning...

               They start to move a little, then turn face to face. Outside 
               their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding 
               downstairs.

                                     BRODY
                         Sean's awake.

                                     ELLEN
                         Door's locked.

                                     BRODY
                              (kissing)
                         Good.

               Their bodies move under the blankets. There's a crash from 
               the kitchen. They stop for a beat. As they resume, little 
               feet return.

                                     SEAN'S VOICE
                         The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.

                                     ELLEN
                              (whispering)
                         Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's 
                         sleeping.

                                     SEAN'S VOICE
                         Okay.

               His feet paddle off. Brody and Ellen start to slide together, 
               passion resumes.

                                     ELLEN
                         C'mere...

               Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up. The Brodys kiss, 
               trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between 
               brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk. Then the 
               sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn beep.

                                     BRODY
                         Mrs. Silvera?

                                     ELLEN
                         Mrs. Silvera.

               They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs, and 
               talk between the boys and Mrs. Silvera. The Brodys look at 
               each other and break up laughing at the morning, and 
               themselves.

               ANGLE ON THE BED

               As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of marriage, 
               swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the floor, each on 
               their side of the bed, still chuckling, up for the day.

                                     BRODY
                         Need a ride?

                                     ELLEN
                         As far as the office.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY STREET   DAY

               The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets, 
               Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers. It slows 
               near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate 
               office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson, 
               Pres." sits. Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at 
               the curb. It has the Amity Shores logo on its side.

                                     BRODY
                         Some people.

                                     SEAN
                         What's daddy doing?

                                     ELLEN
                         Writing a ticket.

               Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hey! That's my boss!

                                     BRODY
                         Better yet.

               Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the 
               office

                                     PETERSON
                         Wait a minute...

                                     BRODY
                         Too late, it's written.

                                     PETERSON
                         Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.
                              (to Ellen)
                         Don't you have any pull with the 
                         chief, here?

                                     ELLEN
                         Do I have to?

                                     PETERSON
                              (taking the ticket)
                         Better get a sales kit together for 
                         after lunch. I'm taking some prospects 
                         out.

               Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work.

                                     ELLEN
                         See you later.

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Brody)
                         Can't we fix it up to get this made 
                         into a green zone or something?

                                     BRODY
                         Len, pay the two dollars.

               Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office. Brody's attention 
               is drawn by some noise by the dock.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE, AMITY - DAY

               Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's 
               newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for 
               patrolling local waters. The boat is Hendricks' personal 
               pride and joy.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (to Red)
                         Tie it off on your left. Your other 
                         left!

               As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Good morning!

                                     BRODY
                              (walking onto the 
                              dock, Sean tagging 
                              along)
                         Aren't you off-duty?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Till noon. This is on my own time.
                              (to Sean)
                         Hi, Shorty.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not short. I'm eleven.

               There's a hoot from a passing boat horn. Sean waves happily.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT

               It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's a 
               scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a full 
               load. The Skipper hails Brody.

                                     SKIPPER
                         Yo! Chief!

                                     BRODY
                         What?

                                     SKIPPER
                         You got a gold-plater drifting in 
                         the main channel. Big cruiser.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Whereabouts?

                                     SKIPPER
                         Off the Point. No running lights, 
                         just a diver's flag.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (aside to Brody)
                         Want me to run out there?

                                     BRODY
                         On your own time?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Happy to do it.

                                     BRODY
                         Then check it out. I'll be in the 
                         office.

               Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Cast off your bow line. And your 
                         stern line. Spring line...

               While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the 
               street.

               Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS

               It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina.

                                     BRODY
                         Where to?

                                     MIKE
                         No place special. Just hanging out.

                                     BRODY
                         Sailing?

               Mike nods.

                                     BRODY
                         Watch your kid brother, huh?

               He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers.

                                     BROOKE
                         Bye, Mr. Brody.

               The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody 
               drives off in his jeep.

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

               The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers 
               around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother.

                         POLO
                 Anyone want to sail to 
                 the lighthouse?

                         PATRICK
                 Machs nix to me.

                         LUCY
                 Anyone got a spare 
                 mooring line? Mine's 
                 shot.

                         TINA
                 I've got one...

                                                       SEAN
                                               Can I go too?

                                                       MIKE
                                               No.

                                                       SEAN
                                               Please.

                                                       MIKE
                                               I said, 'No.'

               Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going 
               over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran.

                                     BROOKE
                         You're not going out right away, are 
                         you?

                                     MIKE
                         Waiting for Andy.

                                     BROOKE
                         I want you to meet my cousin.

                                     MIKE
                         I will, I will.

                                     SEAN
                         I want to go out with you. You need 
                         a crew, don't you?

               Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy 
               Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing 
               suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning 
               diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with 
               him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes."

                                     MIKE
                         I don't need you. Andy's here.

                                     SEAN
                         You always go with Andy.

                              (to Andy)
                         How was dive class?

                         Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-
                         bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is 
                         some weird shit on the bottom of the 
                         ocean.

                         Mostly old garbage. Today we found a 
                         '48 Hudson.

                                     SEAN
                         Do I have to play with the little 
                         kids?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah. Go on, beat it.

               Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for 
               sea.

               FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK

               Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a 
               provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions.

               He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves 
               at her cousin, Brooke.

                                     JACKIE
                         Brooke! Hey!

               One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing 
               some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps 
               on her way down the dock.

               CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE

                         I hope that's the cousin.

               As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the 
               music rocks up and we:

               Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and 
               ornately painted hulls tack back and forth. Lots of chatter 
               between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times.

               It's cruising, on water.

               EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY

                         Real fast.

               He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.

                         Far out!

               Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more 
               fun than a roller coaster.

               overtaking Mike's boat. It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr., 
               the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside.

                                     LARRY
                         Coming up!

                         Gangway, Turkies!

               It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler," 
               and Mike's "Green Machine." The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster," 
               "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe."

                         We're carrying weight.

                                     LARRY
                         We'll take your supercargo.

                         Is that me?

                         That's you.

                         I've never been supercargo.

               Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air.

                                     LARRY
                         Hey, get out of our air!

                                     DONNY
                         Want a passenger?

               ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER AND FELIX

               Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails 
               tight as a tick to the red cat.

                                     BOB
                         Way to go!

               QUICK CUTS: FUN AT SEA

               The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local 
               teen-agers partying with each other:

               --  Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull.

               --  Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze.

               --  Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch."

               --  Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up in their 
               respective boats, the Doughdish and the Inflatable.

               --  Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and Tina in 
               Tina's Joy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER NEAR THE ORCA - DAY

               Silent, green-blue depths. A diver, Crosby, working the 
               bottom, running a search pattern. Another diver, Tom Andrews, 
               running close. They signal to each other, and make another 
               pass.

               Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of 
               the Orca, half-buried in the silt. A diver's line runs up 
               and

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Bobbing on the surface are three boats: the Amity Police 
               launch, the deserted Elizabeth T., from Newport, flying a 
               diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated by 
               Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua 
               Sports" lettered on it somewhere. Hendricks and Red are on 
               the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser.

                         Happens every season -- someone takes 
                         off. Once we had a schooner for a 
                         month while the owners went fox 
                         hunting.

               A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's 
               Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera.

                                     ANDREWS
                         This is all there is.

               Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands.

                         If that's it, that's it.

               The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his engine, 
               and we:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man.

                         I can't watch the news, I can't watch 
                         a ball game, I can't watch movies -- 
                         all I hear is that rotten kid with 
                         his rotten radio... "Breaker, 
                         Breaker..."

                         I'll do what I can, but you're talking 
                         about a federal jurisdiction...

                         One petty theft, one domestic 
                         disturbance, and an exhibitionist.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll take the exhibitionist, you 
                         handle the others.

               Brody is caught in the open.

                         Her bedroom window faces my oldest 
                         boy's bedroom, and she's teasing 
                         him, dancing around in a towel, or 
                         less...

                         Dancing?

               Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from 
               the bottom by the divers.

                                     HENDRICKS

                         Hendricks. I want to go over your 
                         reports and your Form 908.

               They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues behind 
               the door, but it's calm in here.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I never heard of a 908.

                         I just made it up. It means, "Get me 
                         out of there."
                              (notices the camera)
                         What the hell's that?

                         Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought 
                         it up from under that abandoned 
                         cruiser.

                                     BRODY
                         Abandoned? It's a little early in 
                         the season for that.

                         Rich people. Home port is Newport, 
                         Rhode Island.

                                     BRODY
                         If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as 
                         hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone 
                         in the channel.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         If you had a $100,000 boat there'd 
                         be an investigation.

               Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box 
               sitting in the office. Brody makes the mistake of opening 
               the door, revealing the White-Haired Man.

                         Grace Kinney is driving my boy to

                         Hendricks, get a description of that 
                         dance.

                              (to Brody)
                         Chief Brody? I want to talk to you 
                         about my daughter... she's 15, but 
                         mature for her age...

                         WOMAN
                 Chief, I've been telling 
                 Mrs. Prendergast that 
                 it's no good just 
                 talking about Albert, 
                 she's got to do 
                 something...

                                                       2ND MAN
                                               Look -- the township is 
                                               responsible for protecting 
                                               life and property, and my 
                                               property is unprotected... 

               As Brody turns to deal with the mess, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER

               Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette 
               against the daylight. There's a commotion, and a water ski 
               drops into view. Then another one. Pale legs churn the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing 
               in the water, the engine idling. Two girls are fooling around; 
               the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is 
               Diane.

                                     TERRY
                         Did you ever see a dolphin?

                                     DIANE
                         Sure. They like to play. We may see 
                         some today.

                                     TERRY
                         Great!

               She fumbles with her skis.

                                     TERRY
                         Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play 
                         with the dolphins without skis...

                                     DIANE
                         Ready?

                                     TERRY
                         Hang on, hang on... Okay, go.

               Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, 
               starting forward. Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the 
               throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright.

               A wake boils out from under her skis.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter 
               of the dunes. There's a portable radio, a cooler with some 
               beer, and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone. Above 
               the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski 
               boat can be seen, raising a big wake. Tina disengages, and 
               sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.

                         Take a break for a minute, okay?

                                     ED
                         Huh?

               Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is 
               towing Terry on the water.

                                     TINA
                         Eddie, can we do that?
                              (no reaction)
                         Can we go skiing? We can use my 
                         Uncle's boat. Eddie?

                                     ED
                         Next week.

                                     TINA
                         With you, everything's next week. I 
                         want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?

               Ed grunts non-comittally. Tina takes a beer from the cooler, 
               and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane. She waves 
               to them, and to someone down the beach.

               EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, 
               also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. 
               She acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention 
               back to the skiers.

               ANGLE ON THE SKIERS

               having a wonderful time. Terry is good, criss-crossing the 
               wake, showing off.

               CLOSE ON TERRY

               rushing through the water, waving, stunting.

                                     TERRY
                         Faster! Faster!

               She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax 
               more speed out of the old engine.

               UNDERWATER

               following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the turbulent 
               wake.

               ON THE SURFACE

               Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her. She glances at 
               it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.

                                     TERRY
                         Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!

               The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her. She 
               puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free.

               UNDERWATER

               Closing in on the wake, crossing it.

               TERRY - ON THE SURFACE

               The fin cuts across her path. Too late to maneuver, Terry 
               hits the looming gray back of the Shark. The skis bump, leave 
               the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill. The rope around 
               her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging her, 
               preventing her from shouting. She flounders as Diane slows 
               the boat to see what's happened.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT

               turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or 
               hurt herself.

                                     DIANE
                         Terry! You okay?

                                     TERRY
                         Help! Help!

                                     DIANE
                         Okay, okay, coming...

               She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation -- 
               she hasn't seen the fin.

               ANGLE ON TERRY

               hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope, trying 
               to get to the boat.

               UNDERWATER

               Closing in on the thrashing figure.

               TERRY

               Screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her.

               Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water 
               where she went under.

               IN THE BOAT - DIANE

               Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky. She pulls 
               the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with 
               nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end.

                                     DIANE
                              (screaming)
                         Terry!

               Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and 
               butting the stern, jarring the engine loose. Fuel spills 
               from a ruptured line.

                                     DIANE
                         Help! God, help!

               She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under the 
               water.

               DISTANT ANGLE ON THE BOAT - FROM THE BEACH

               Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams 
               floating across the water; at this range they sound like the 
               normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun....

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT - CLOSE

               as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a 
               chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws. Diane 
               hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on.

               She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare 
               pistol. She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark.

               CLOSE ON THE SHARK

               The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of 
               the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame.

               DIANE

               A last flash before the gasoline explodes.

                                     DIANE
                         No-o-o-o-o-o...!

               A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame, the 
               Shark forgotten. She falls into the water as the ruined boat 
               overturns and there's an oily explosion.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY - ED AND TINA

               Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of the 
               boat blowing up.

               EXT. PORCH - DAY

               Mrs. Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy.

               She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore.

               Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook. Hendricks 
               is on the radio, talking to the shore.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I can't find anyone out here. They 
                         must've gone to the bottom, or drifted 
                         with the current.

               BRODY ON SHORE

               He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his 
               portable walkie-talkie. Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the 
               b.g.

               Nearby, we can see a sign: "BURIED CABLE: Call New England 
               Light and Power Before Digging." The cable itself surfaces 
               in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole 
               for distribution to the island. Ed and Tina are also there, 
               having given statements.

                         There should be bodies. Witnesses 
                         say two people; one in the boat, one 
                         skiing.

               Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook.

                         We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' 
                         out there, and when we looked, there 
                         was just this cloud of smoke.

                         That was the explosion. One minute 
                         they were having a wonderful time, 
                         the next, bang!

                         I don't know what could've done that.

               Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under 
               that calm surface?

                                     TINA
                         Can we go now?

               Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean.

                         Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?

                         Oh, yeah. Sure.

               As he gazes at the ocean, we hear the sound of a distant

               ABROAD THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT

               Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand, 
               with big grappling hooks attached. The boat is lit by its 
               powerful worklights. Hendricks heaves them out, watches as 
               the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear, hauling 
               back.

               It goes taut with a sudden strain.

               Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a

               There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of 
               the boat down as it struggles with the weight.

               lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch. The 
               cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the 
               black depths. What? The coupling appears, then the hook, and 
               an oily cable.

               He hits the release on the winch, and the cable whines as it 
               spins out and settles back on the bottom. Red jiggles the 
               line, trying to free it up.

                         Every day?

                                     MIKE
                         What else is there to do?

                                     BRODY
                         You could work out at the beach, 
                         make a few bucks for school.

                                     MIKE
                         Do I have to?

                                     BRODY
                         You'll have to make up your own mind 
                         about that.

                                     ELLEN
                         Where's my day book?

                                     BRODY
                         In the den.

               Ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it.

                                     ELLEN
                         He doesn't have to work all the time, 
                         it's his vacation.

               Mrs. Silvera enters from the service porch.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Good morning -- everyone up early 
                         today?

                                     BRODY
                         There's a lot going on.

               He follows Ellen into the den.

               INT. DEN - DAY

               Ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table, looking 
               for her book.

                                     ELLEN
                         Why don't you take a half day and 
                         clean this junk up?

                                     BRODY
                         Because, I'm in the middle of a 
                         boating accident, I got only four 
                         regular cops and one secretary, and 
                         a Chief Deputy who is constantly 
                         fiddling with the police boat. He's 
                         another one.

                                     ELLEN
                         One what?
                              (she finds the book)
                         Ah-ha!

                                     BRODY
                         Boat nut. What is it about this place 
                         that makes everyone a freak for 
                         boating?

                                     ELLEN
                         It's an island.
                              (she pecks him on the 
                              cheek)
                         Got to run.

               She heads out the door for the office. Mike approaches.

               ANGLE ON MIKE AND BRODY

                                     MIKE
                         I'm going.

                                     BRODY
                         What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up 
                         old cars? Bartending?

                                     MIKE
                         Bartending? I'm 17.

                                     BRODY
                         Okay, not bartending. Why on the 
                         water every day?

                                     MIKE
                         Because.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, humor the old man -- just be 
                         careful.

                                     MIKE
                              (going)
                         I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Mike passes through on his way out, nodding to Mrs. Silvera 
               who acknowledges his passage.  Brody is close on his heels.

                                     BRODY
                         Don't go out if it's rough or 
                         anything, huh? We've had a lot of 
                         trouble.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay, okay.

               The back door slams behind him.

                                     SEAN
                         Can I go with you today?

                                     BRODY
                         You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. 
                         Okay?

               Sean nods, resigning himself to the inevitable.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                              (to Sean)
                         You can come with me to the market.

                                     SEAN
                         All right.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll be at the office.

               Mrs. Silvera nods, and pours Sean a glass of milk. Brody 
               sighs, and heads out the door. Sean calls after him.

                                     SEAN
                         Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful, 
                         all day.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY

               Sitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike, 
               Andy, Brooke, and Jackie. They are heeled over in a brisk 
               wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are 
               Patrick and Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats.

                                     LUCY
                              (from her boat)
                         Where're we going?

                                     ANDY
                         Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse.

                                     BROOKE
                         The lighthouse?

                                     ANDY
                         No big thing, we'll see who's out 
                         there, maybe picnic.

                                     MIKE
                         We got some stuff at the store. Ed 
                         and Tina are going to be there.

                                     BROOKE
                         Oh, sure, they would be.

                                     JACKIE
                         What's the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE
                         It's an island, near here, with a 
                         lighthouse. We sometimes hang out 
                         there, you know...

                                     JACKIE
                         Great. I got some wine.

               She opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a 
               jug of Mountain Red. Brooke slides over to her.

               ANGLE ON BROOKE AND JACKIE

                                     BROOKE
                              (aside)
                         The lighthouse is a make-out spot.

                                     JACKIE
                         Now I really want to see it.

                                     BROOKE
                         You going to fool around with Mike?
                              (Jackie shrugs)
                         Well, I'm not doing anything with 
                         him.

               She indicates Andy, who pretends great indifference.

                                     JACKIE
                         Well, maybe I will, then.

               Andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool.

               Mike concentrates on his sailing, Jackie grins an impish, 
               vixen grin, Brooke shrugs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               spectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse, showing 
               ocean, sandy beach, some of the Kids' catamarans pulled up 
               on the sand, other pleasure boats cruising in the b.g.

               Ed and Tina are running down the stairs, laughing.

                                     ED
                         Come on back up here!

                                     TINA
                         Nope.

                                     ED
                         Give me back my hat!

                                     TINA
                         Double nope!

               ANGLE ON THE SAND

               where Andy, Mike, Jackie, and Brooke are camped around a 
               blanket listening to a portable radio. Ed and Tina run by.

                                     ANDY
                         Why'd they decide to move?

                                     BROOKE
                         Too hot in the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE
                         Too hot for those two? I can't believe 
                         it.

                                     JACKIE
                         Is there something I don't know about?

                                     BROOKE
                         I told you, remember?

                                     JACKIE
                         Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing 
                         it now?

               There's a little round of giggling.

                                     ANDY
                         Maybe by now they are.

                                     MIKE
                         They're moving pretty fast.

                                     JACKIE
                         He's cute...

               ANGLE ON ED & TINA

               running towards a dune and over it.

               ANGLE ON MASSIVE SHAPE

               in f.g., covered with birds. Ed and Tina appear over the 
               crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of 
               seagulls, suddenly disturbed. The whir and drumbeat of wings, 
               and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock.

               CLOSEUP - TINA

               reacting.

                                     TINA
                         Yech!

               HER POINT OF VIEW

               The huge hulk of a beached, decomposing dead whale, a few 
               birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails. Big 
               festering red holes mark its sides.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT -  SAND AND WHALE

               From the top of the lighthouse, we can see a group of 
               interested spectators, clustered around the whale like ants 
               at a picnic. A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor 
               just off the shore, including the Amity police boat.

               Three Ants are walking towards the crowd, one of them 
               gesturing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON BRODY, HENDRICKS AND A WOMAN

               She's Lureen Elkins, a marine biologist from the Oceanographic 
               Institute, and she's skeptical. Brody is the ant whose 
               antennae were waving in the long shot.

                                     BRODY
                         As soon as I heard about it, I called 
                         you. This thing is big!

               His arms indicate big.

                                     ELKINS
                         After we've looked, we'll talk.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         This is it.

               He moves forward to clear the crowd. Some kids are poking 
               the massive hulk with sticks. A tourist couple is snapping 
               away with a Polaroid SX-70. The whole mess stinks, too.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Move back, please... back off... 
                         open it up a little...

               The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins.

                                     BRODY
                         See? What'd I tell you?

               ANGLE ON THE WHALE

               Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches 
               the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.

                                     BRODY
                         Look at that!

                                     ELKINS
                         First things first.

               She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody.

                                     ELKINS
                         From the tip of the snout, please.

               Elkins is measuring the length of the creature. She calls 
               off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all 
               down, repeating numbers as he hears them.

                                     ELKINS
                         Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, let's check the bite radius.

                                     ELKINS
                              (cold)
                         The what?

                                     BRODY
                         Bite radius. You know, the size of 
                         the mouth?

                                     ELKINS
                         The whale's mouth?

                                     BRODY
                         The Shark's mouth.

                                     ELKINS
                         What shark?

               Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.

                                     BRODY
                         The shark that did this. It was a 
                         shark, wasn't it?

                                     ELKINS
                         We don't know that, do we?

                                     BRODY
                         But that's what we're here to find 
                         out, right?

                                     ELKINS
                         You don't tell me my job, and I won't 
                         tell you about yours, okay?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I can't hear you if you're going to 
                         whisper.

                                     MIKE
                         Can we go now?

               He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to 
               return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Mike)
                         You stay here a minute.

                                     MIKE
                         Oh, c'mon.

                                     BRODY
                         You heard me.

                                     JACKIE
                         We'll be over by the lighthouse.

                                     MIKE
                         I'll be right there. Wait up.

               They hang around, waiting for him. Elkins has reclaimed 
               Brody's attention.

                                     ELKINS
                         Could be a shark. But maybe not.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, I know a little bit about 
                         sharks.

                                     ELKINS
                         Do you?

                                     BRODY
                         I know that this was probably a Great 
                         White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...

               He fumbles for the correct Latin.

                                     ELKINS
                              (helping out)
                         Carcharadon Carcharias.

                                     BRODY
                         That's it.

                                     ELKINS
                         Okay, so that's it.

                                     BRODY
                         Is there one in these waters?

                                     ELKINS
                         What makes you think there might be?

                                     BRODY
                         Because this big fish has been bitten 
                         by some other big fish...

                                     ELKINS
                         This is a mammal, not a fish.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want 
                         to know if a Great White Shark did 
                         this.

                                     ELKINS
                         Probably.

                                     BRODY
                         That's it? Probably? Look, sharks 
                         are attracted by blood, and thrashing 
                         around...

                                     ELKINS
                         And sound.

                                     BRODY
                              (this is a new one)
                         Sound?

                                     ELKINS
                         Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They 
                         home in on irregular sounds, unusual 
                         sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency 
                         vibration.

                                     BRODY
                         So there's one around here.

                                     ELKINS
                         Not necessarily. These wounds could've 
                         been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, 
                         or more. None of them are immediately 
                         fatal. Currents could've carried the 
                         body 10 miles further.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (chiming in)
                         We got a helluva tide this month.

                                     BRODY
                         Could you just keep that crowd back, 
                         please?

                                     MIKE
                              (fidgeting)
                         Pop...

                                     BRODY
                         You stay right here. You're going in 
                         with me.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE

               As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to 
               Hendricks.

                         MIKE
                 We came out in my boat.

                         BRODY
                 Andy can sail in it.

                         MIKE
                 I got a date!

                         BRODY
                 She'll understand.

                         MIKE
                 She won't. 

                                                       ELKINS
                                               Lower jaw displaced and 
                                               lacerated by predator 
                                               attempt to seize the tongue. 
                                               Additional large tissue 
                                               loss in the dorsal and sub-
                                               dorsal areas, as well as 
                                               the caudal. Oriamal bite 
                                               radius 37 inches, allowing 
                                               for salt-water erosion and 
                                               subsequent small predator 
                                               and scavenger tissue 
                                               attacks...

               The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on 
               between father and son.

                                     BRODY
                         I don't want to discuss it.

               Elkins crosses to Brody.

                                     ELKINS
                         It's either a Great White, or another 
                         killer whale.

                                     BRODY
                         Can't you tell?

                                     ELKINS
                         Not when it's like this. This animal 
                         has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, 
                         and drifting for a day, at least. 
                         Every little nibbler in the sea's 
                         taken a bite.

                                     BRODY
                         Look -- can Great White Sharks 
                         communicate? Send out signals, or 
                         something? You know, take revenge, 
                         sense an enemy...

                                     ELKINS
                         Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't 
                         take things personally.

                                     MIKE
                         Dad, please...

               Brody turns on him.  This at least, is something he can do 
               something about.

                                     BRODY
                         No more sailing. You come back with 
                         me, and that's it.

                                     MIKE
                         Why me?

                                     BRODY
                         Because I say so.

                                     ANDY
                         I'll tie up at the town dock, don't 
                         worry, man.

                                     JACKIE
                         See you later, Mikey...

                                     ED AND TINA
                         Later, bye...
                              (ad lib)

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. AMITY TOWN HALL - DAY

               Vaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty 
               town meeting hall, towards the conference table. They are 
               alone.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm showing summer rentals. We got a 
                         helluva season going.

                                     BRODY
                         We have got to talk, and we have got 
                         to talk alone.

                                     VAUGHN
                         We're alone.

                                     BRODY
                         Larry, I don't know how to say this, 
                         but I think we got a shark problem. 
                         A real one.

               Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private 
               office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in.

               INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols 
               of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall: a photo of the beach, 
               featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new 
               Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress, 
               a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, 
               etc.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Are you serious?

                                     BRODY
                         Of course. Look -- I've got some 
                         missing persons, fatalities, evidence 
                         of a large predator...

                                     VAUGHN
                         No one has seen a shark -- no fin, 
                         no bites, nothing. Be realistic.

                                     BRODY
                         I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- 
                         you can understand that, can't you?

                                     VAUGHN
                         Of course I can, but can't it wait? 
                         These things cost money, and this 
                         town doesn't have much money.

                                     BRODY
                         We have to do something.

                                     VAUGHN
                         We have done something -- hell, we 
                         damn near went broke putting up a 
                         shark watch tower on the beach -- 
                         it's the only one in 2000 miles, 
                         y'know.

                                     BRODY
                         I know, I know...

                                     VAUGHN
                         And I stood by while you told the 
                         people from Ramada and Marriott that 
                         if they put up a hotel they'd need 
                         $800,000 worth of steel net around 
                         their beaches! In New England? We 
                         all lost on that one.

                                     BRODY
                         It's still a good idea.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, when we build up our tax 
                         base a little, you can have everything 
                         you want; right now, the town's broke.

                                     BRODY
                         Please, Larry -- there's good reason.
                         Those water skiers...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (interrupting)
                         A tragedy. But that was a boating 
                         accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing 
                         but a boating accident.

                                     BRODY
                         Two of them are still missing!

                                     VAUGHN
                         There's always deaths in these waters 
                         that never turn up. Are they all 
                         shark victims?

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe they are!

               Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Bullshit.

                                     BRODY
                              (shouting)
                         Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- 
                         there's a dead whale out there with 
                         bites all over it!

                                     VAUGHN
                              (shouting back)
                         What am I, an ass? When you called 
                         me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. 
                         Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

                                     BRODY
                         Someone has to do something.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (back in control)
                         Don't push it this time. If you do, 
                         it won't turn out the way you want, 
                         I guarantee you that.

               The two men study each other for a long moment. Then,

                                     VAUGHN
                         I've got to get back to work.

               He holds the door for Brody, who walks out as Vaughn lags 
               behind, locking up his sanctum.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)

               Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home 
               and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered 
               with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn. The 
               sign reads: "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN."

               Plastered across it is an added streamer: "NOW OPEN." Barely 
               visible underneath are older notices: "UNDER CONSTRUCTION," 
               and "OPENING IN JUNE."

               As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main 
               road and heads down towards the beach.

               EXT. BEACH - DUSK

               Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he 
               continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; 
               some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few 
               solitary surfcasters and fishermen.

               The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his 
               jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees 
               something:

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the 
               surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the 
               waterskiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.

               ANGLE ON THE SURF

               As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets 
               out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up 
               onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this 
               object.

               It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here" 
               motions. The junk resists.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, give a guy a break.

               No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up 
               his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water 
               after it.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...

               It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks 
               across his crotch.

                                     BRODY
                         Hoo! Cold!

               He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it, 
               he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery...

                                     BRODY
                              (ad lib)
                         Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You 
                         bastard. A little closer... Here 
                         y'go...

               Then, he's got it ---

                                     BRODY
                              (exultant)
                         Gotcha!

               CLOSE ON BRODY IN THE WATER

               As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him. 
               Suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something 
               lunges out of the mess and into Brody.

               SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"

               Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the 
               gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled 
               away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He 
               screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out of 
               the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged 
               from the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on 
               his face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, 
               The Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the 
               sea.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - CYANIDE 
               BOTTLE

               Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, 
               from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. Follow 
               the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the 
               deserted office. He is injecting the deadly chemical into 
               some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges 
               are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, 
               sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. The 
               radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine 
               reports faintly in the b.g. -- a slow night in pre-season 
               Amity.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               As a sound at the door makes him look up. He hides the odd 
               gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Chief?

                                     BRODY
                         In here.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I missed you at the funeral home. 
                         Santos said you were here.

                                     BRODY
                         You didn't miss much. Christ, what a 
                         mess.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Positive I.D.?

                                     BRODY
                         The woman passenger on the boat that 
                         blew up.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Oh.

               There's an awkward pause. Brody sees the box with the divers' 
               stuff sitting where it was left earlier.

                                     BRODY
                         What about that camera?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What camera?

                                     BRODY
                         That one -- from the wreck. You 
                         brought it up, did you look inside 
                         it?

               Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't.

                                     BRODY
                         Well, what the hell -- might be 
                         something worth seeing. Take it 
                         somewhere and see if there's film in 
                         it...

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (catching on)
                         If there is, develop it!

                                     BRODY
                         You got it.

               The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I know just where to go.

                                     BRODY
                         Not the drugstore!

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Of course not, They're closed. Phil 
                         Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.

                                     BRODY
                         The drugstore's closed? What the 
                         hell time is it?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

                                     BRODY
                         Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close 
                         up, okay?

               And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide 
               bullets safely in his pocket.

                                     BRODY
                              (at the door)
                         Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long 
                         distance call, very important. Give 
                         them my home phone.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Right.

               Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are 
               safe inside, then exits. As Hendricks watches him go,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat. He is slouching 
               towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside. He 
               perks up, and starts to move faster.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house.

               The Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an 
               electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the 
               following.

                                     ELLEN
                              (into the phone)
                         Thank you. I'll tell him.

                                     BRODY
                         For me?

                                     ELLEN
                              (hanging up)
                         Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard 
                         the research vessel Aurora, presently 
                         in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be 
                         in radio range until half-past next 
                         spring.

                                     BRODY
                         Damn.

               He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped 
               package of gun and ammunition.

                                     MIKE
                         Is Hooper coming to dinner?

                                     BRODY
                         Not till next year.

               He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

               Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where 
               he carefully puts the gun in the bed table. Ellen finds him.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, hi -- How was dinner?

                                     ELLEN
                         Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family 
                         affair. Where were you?

                                     BRODY
                              (getting up)
                         Santos' place.

               They both know what that means -- the morgue. Brody goes 
               into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot water.

                                     BRODY
                         Oww!

                                     ELLEN
                         Careful. What's wrong?

                                     BRODY
                         Nothing.

                                     ELLEN
                         Nothing, huh?

                                     BRODY
                         That's what I said. Is there any of 
                         that hand cleaner stuff?

                                     ELLEN
                         Use the little brush there. Why were 
                         you at Santos'?

                                     BRODY
                         Found one of the missing victims 
                         from that boat deal.

                                     ELLEN
                         Oh. Want to talk about it?

                                     BRODY
                         No.

                                     ELLEN
                         Terrific.

               Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when 
               Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.

                                     BRODY
                         Michael.

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah?

                                     BRODY
                         You want to come here a minute?

               Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on 
               into his room.

                                     SEAN
                         Hi Dad.

                                     BRODY
                         Hiya yourself.

                                     MIKE
                         What is it?

               He expects something: this is a formal audience with the 
               Head of The House.

                                     BRODY
                         I got something for you to do 
                         tomorrow.

                                     MIKE
                         I kind of had plans...

                                     BRODY
                         Sailing?
                              (Mike nods)
                         Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. 
                         No more boats.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, come on...

                                     BRODY
                         No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at 
                         the beach, and he's got a job for 
                         you there. You can work until school 
                         starts.

                                     ELLEN
                         All summer?

                                     BRODY
                         He wanted a job, he's got one. I 
                         want to see that boat out of the 
                         water by tomorrow night.

               We see Sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see 
               what the fuss is about.

               ANGLE ON SEAN'S DOOR

               It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his 
               brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly closes 
               the door.

                                     MIKE (O.S.)
                         Dad, please...

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                         Tomorrow night. Out of the water.

               ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY

               Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming 
               the door as he exits. From inside the room, loud rock music 
               muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age 
               rebellion.

                                     ELLEN
                         Not so loud!

               The music lowers its volume. Brody turns to go into the 
               bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed...

                                     BRODY
                         I know what you're going to say.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you?

                                     BRODY
                              (on the bed)
                         In the city, it happened all the 
                         time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, 
                         top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under 
                         the Brooklyn local, old people die 
                         alone in shitty apartments and three 
                         weeks later someone calls the cops 
                         because of the smell and the flies.  
                         Call the cops. What are we, immune?

                                     ELLEN
                         It was bad, wasn't it.

                                     BRODY
                         The goddamn smell is always the same.
                              (he shudders at the 
                              recollection)

                                     ELLEN
                         Are you going to be able to sleep?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. I think so.
                              (he raises his voice)
                         Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!

               Ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door. The upstairs 
               hallway is empty, the doors closed. The Brody household 
               compartmented and closed for the night.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's 
               a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to 
               the tall steel tower that dominates the beach.

               A classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking 
               area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant 
               waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark:

               Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including 
               a woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee.

                                     PETERSON
                         This is the town beach; the 
                         development naturally has its own 
                         private access, but I wanted you to 
                         see the concession area. Look at 
                         that sand -- like sugar!

               He scoops up a handful of the fine powder. Ellen directs the 
               attention of the photographers.

                                     ELLEN
                         During the summer, the sun sets right 
                         there...
                              (she points)
                         Over the water. Beautiful.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Ellen)
                         I'll say hello for you.

               Ellen nods, preoccupied. Vaughn strolls away, headed in the 
               direction of the cabanas. Mary Nichols, a local Selectwoman, 
               emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions.

                                     NICHOLS
                         Hello -- selling some more of the 
                         good life?

                                     ELLEN
                         A piece here, a piece there, it all 
                         adds up.

                                     NICHOLS
                         Your husband's been here all morning. 
                         What's he doing?

                                     ELLEN
                              (good-naturedly)
                         His job.

               Michael Brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is 
               repainting some flaking woodwork. Sean is happily mixing 
               paint. Vaughn joins them.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Your dad got you working?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah.

               He continues his chore, without enthusiasm.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm helping.

                                     VAUGHN
                         You know where your dad is?

                                     MIKE
                         Up there.

               He points at the tower.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Oh, for Christ's sake.

               He crosses briskly to where Peterson is finishing.

                                     PETERSON
                         And if you have any questions about 
                         recreational possibilities, Ellen 
                         Brody here will be happy to answer 
                         them.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Len, can I see you a minute?

               Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor.

                                     PETERSON
                         I think we got a couple of live ones.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Brody's riding his tower.

                                     PETERSON
                              (looking up)
                         Oh, shit.

               BRODY IN THE TOWER

               sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to 
               scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the 
               unseeing crowd.

               ON THE WATER

               Larry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. Bob 
               is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing 
               lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller 
               works.  He's on her like glue.

                                     JACKIE
                         This is fun! Can we go faster?

                                     LARRY
                              (to Bob)
                         Trim.

               Bob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts.

                                     JACKIE
                         Yay!

               She snuggles in Larry's arms. He waves to someone.

                                     LARRY
                         That's my dad!

               Jackie waves without seeing.

               ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn waves back, preoccupied. Near him, Mike Brody looks 
               up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. He splashes 
               paint onto the wood with angry abandon.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Peterson)
                         Wave to my son.

                                     PETERSON
                              (waving)
                         How the hell do we get him down from 
                         there?

                                     VAUGHN
                         Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get 
                         them back in the bus.

               Mrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter.

                         Renee wants to know what that man is 
                         doing way up there?

                                     PETERSON
                         He's, ah, watching. A lookout.

                                     MRS. BRYANT
                         For what?

                                     RENEE
                              (a precocious little 
                              girl)
                         It's a shark tower. I saw one in 
                         Florida. He's looking for sharks.

                                     VAUGHN
                         It's an observation platform. That's 
                         our Chief of Police. He's just 
                         checking it.

                                     PETERSON
                         Normally, it's used for, ah, bird 
                         watching. Nature observation. Weather 
                         measurements, that sort of thing.
                              (a little desperate)
                         Ellen, we're running late!

                                     ELLEN
                         Okay. Folks, if we could get back 
                         on, we'll show you the country club, 
                         and stop for lunch...

               At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin 
               flocking back into the van. Peterson herds them along.

                                     PETERSON
                         The country club has an 18-hole 
                         course, putting greens, and twelve 
                         tennis courts...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BRODY IN THE TOWER

               still scanning. His body suddenly tenses. There's something 
               out there. He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to 
               get a better look.

               HIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS)

               Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving under 
               the buoys and into the swimming area.

               BRODY AGAIN

               He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it 
               with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through 
               the water towards the unprotected bathers.

                                     BRODY
                              (screaming)
                         Out of the water! Everyone out of 
                         the water!

               No one can hear him. A few little faces look up, unable to 
               catch what he's saying. He starts climbing down the ladder 
               shouting.

                                     BRODY
                         Get out of the water! Tell everyone 
                         to get out! Now! Out of the water!

               ANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS

               reacting.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (recalling another 
                              panic)
                         Oh, my God...

                                     PETERSON
                         What the hell is he doing?

                                     NICHOLS
                         Oh, no!

               ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN

               Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic.

               THE WATER

               The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting 
               to look around. Most of them are oblivious to what's happening 
               on shore.

               FOLLOW BRODY

               as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water, 
               fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide 
               bullets. He is bumping into people, knocking little kids 
               over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.

                                     BRODY
                         Out of the water! Now! Everyone!

               VAUGHN

               Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering...

               ELLEN

               Moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding 
               the impulsive kid back.

                                     ELLEN
                              (seeing something)
                         Martin! No!

               ANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN

               The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape in 
               the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky grip. 
               People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves flat on 
               the sand, running, some of them going into the water.

                                     BRODY
                         No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!

               He fires. Again. Bullets ricochet off the water, howling 
               towards the horizon. Real panic now. Four more shots.

               Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody 
               on his knees, fumbling with bullets.

               ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD

               standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of 
               Police fumbling with his gun.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         It's bluefish! It's a school of 
                         bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water 
               in a dark, dense group. The swimmers look around, confused 
               by the shots and excitement.

                                     A SWIMMER
                         What's going on?

                                     ANOTHER SWIMMER
                         Fish! Anyone got a net?

                                     3RD SWIMMER
                         Someone get me a rod and reel!

               Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move 
               around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving 
               the water to join friends and families on the sand.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd 
               collects at a safe distance around him: Ellen emerges from a 
               group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols.

                                     BRODY
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...

               Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy. Brody 
               realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter the 
               sand at his feet.

                                     BRODY
                         Okay, it's all over, go on, it's 
                         over. No trouble...

               Ellen joins him.

                                     ELLEN
                         It's okay. It's over...

               Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets 
               in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in the 
               sand for the empty shells.

               The crowd is curious and embarrassed. Some turn away, others

               drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just 
               happened, others stare rudely. Brody is coming apart.

                                     BRODY
                         It's all right, everything's all 
                         right...

               Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the 
               bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)
                         Let's go, everyone... Mrs. Bryant, 
                         Len, please...

               CLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN

               He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid 
               in a fierce hug.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

               A hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in 
               session: Vaughn, Peterson, and three others: Kaiser, an old 
               man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and Nichols, 
               the woman on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Brody's a good man.

                                     KAISER
                         Nobody says he isn't.

                                     PETERSON
                         You should've been out there. You 
                         should've seen him waving that gun, 
                         like a maniac. There were shots fired!

                                     VAUGHN
                         He thought he had a good reason.

                                     MS. NICHOLS
                         But that's not rational behavior!

                                     PETERSON
                         That's what I'm saying!

                                     VAUGHN
                         How many people were there?

                                     MS. NICHOLS
                         Hundred! Literally hundreds. What 
                         are they going to say about us?

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Vaughn)
                         Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to 
                         make a buck like anybody else.

                                     VAUGHN
                         So? So?

                                     PETERSON
                         So it can't be done like that. The 
                         man's a menace, plain and simple.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Look, what am I supposed to do? It's 
                         done, it's over. We have to deal 
                         with the consequences.

                                     SANSOM
                         That's what we're here to do.

                                     VAUGHN
                         All right. Let's go into my office, 
                         where we can have a little privacy.

               ANGLE FROM INSIDE VAUGHN'S OFFICE

               as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters. Vaughn 
               deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the 
               room.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I believe we have a quorum, and 
                         informally, I suggest we call this 
                         meeting an executive session and 
                         dispense with minutes...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a 
               little gold statuette of a pistol marksman. What's done is 
               done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with it. 
               The phone rings, is answered in the other room. The buzzer 
               sounds. Brody picks up his end.

                                     BRODY
                         Polly, no calls, please...
                              (she insists)
                         Okay, okay.
                              (he punches a button)
                         Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What 
                         pictures... I'll be right down...

               He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed 
               with a purpose.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DARKROOM - DAY

               Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the 
               holidome opening, drying on wires. Phil Fogarty, the indignant 
               fat man and town photographer, is locking the door behind an 
               impatient Brody.

                                     PHIL
                         I don't know what you did, but that 
                         kid stopped. I haven't heard one 
                         peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for 
                         days. Believe me, it's a pleasure...

                                     BRODY
                         You said something about a camera.

                                     PHIL
                         Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought 
                         in this camera, see, from underwater, 
                         and I didn't know how to get it open, 
                         but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, 
                         he works at a hi-fi store, and they 
                         sell cameras, so he...

                                     BRODY
                              (interrupting)
                         Did you get any pictures?

                                     PHIL
                         Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny 
                         thing. You can't tell much from the 
                         negatives, I was going to blow 'em 
                         up. Here's a test I did...

               He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him.

               INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

               Brody stares down at it. Sure enough, the ghostly outlines 
               of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a gesture 
               at the camera.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                         Oh, Jesus. That boat...

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND PHIL

                                     PHIL
                         Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, 
                         probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, 
                         though...

                                     BRODY
                         What else you got?

                                     PHIL
                         Let's see -- you got a minute?

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

                                     PHIL
                         Okay, okay -- stand over there...

               He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some 
               big enamel pans for washing and developing prints. Phil 
               switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper, 
               putting it under the enlarger.

               QUICK CUTS:

               --  Enlarger light going on.

               --  Timer ticking, the hand turning.

               --  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat 
               again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected 
               on the enlarger's flat base.

               --  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands.

               --  Brody staring down.

               INSERT (PROCESS)

               Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of 
               what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the 
               grinning jaws of the Great White.

               SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK

               A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca, 
               trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes 
               through the glass, its head huge as it lunges.

               INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS)

               The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable 
               photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the 
               snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a 
               memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning 
               is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster 
               face-to-face, it's nothing.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                              (shaken)
                         That one there. That one...

               Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print 
               in the bath. The shark's features are indistinguishable from 
               the surrounding detail.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town 
               hall, already lit from within. He's carrying a large envelope.

               INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

               The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and 
               Vaughn are seated informally around the big table.

                                     PETERSON
                              (looking up)
                         Speak of the devil.

               Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo.

                                     BRODY
                         Thank God you guys were all together. 
                         I got something for you. Proof!

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, this is kind of an official 
                         meeting

                                     BRODY
                         Perfect. Look at this ---

               He fumbles with the envelope.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has 
                         a question only you can answer.

                                     BRODY
                              (preoccupied)
                         What?

                                     PETERSON
                         Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill 
                         in as an interim Chief of Police in 
                         your absence?

                                     BRODY
                         Temporarily? Uh... sure... The 
                         question's out of left field. Why 
                         are they asking?

                                     NICHOLS
                         So Jeff could handle things? He knows 
                         the routine, he has the authority?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. Why?

                                     PETERSON
                         It came up during the meeting.

                                     BRODY
                         Look -- I just got this from Phil 
                         Fogarty. It was in the camera 
                         belonging to the missing divers. It 
                         proves I was right, all along.

               He throws the picture down in front of them. They bend over 
               to study it, pass it around, look at it.

                         KAISER
                 Seaweed?

                                                       NICHOLS
                                               It's underwater, isn't it? That's 
                                               why it's so dark.

                                     SANSOM
                         I don't know -- what is it?

                                     BRODY
                         It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, 
                         it's right there!

               He snatches up the photo.

               INSERT PHOTO

               Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not 
               proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.

                         It's nothing I can see.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               waving the picture.

                                     BRODY
                         What are you all, blind? It's a shark. 
                         Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.

                                     PETERSON
                         Is that what it is?

                                     BRODY
                         You're damn right that's what it is.

                                     NICHOLS
                         I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

               Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing..."

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, it could be anything.

                                     BRODY
                              (exploding)
                         What the hell does it take to make 
                         sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's 
                         right there in front of you. I know 
                         what a goddamn shark looks like, 
                         I've been through it, don't you 
                         understand? I've seen this sonofabitch 
                         before!

               The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's 
               agitation. Tempers are running high.

                                     PETERSON
                         What have you seen before? This is 
                         nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in 
                         the lens.

                                     BRODY
                         My ass!

                                     VAUGHN
                         Be reasonable, please...

                                     PETERSON
                              (to Vaughn)
                         Forget it, he won't listen.

                                     BRODY
                         There is nothing to discuss.

                                     PETERSON
                              (blowing up)
                         Will you listen to this man? Will 
                         you just listen to him?
                              (to Brody)
                         You really caused a panic on a public 
                         beach, you shoot up the place, God 
                         knows who could've been injured -- 
                         what if somebody decides to sue us? 
                         That could ruin us.

                                     BRODY
                         Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? 
                         I'll pay for it. Take it out of my 
                         salary.

                                     PETERSON
                         You don't make enough.

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe I don't make as much money as 
                         some bullshit rip-off artists around 
                         here, but I don't work the same way.

                                     PETERSON
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     BRODY
                         It means I don't like all that grab-
                         ass and heavy breathing with my wife, 
                         it means I know who's out to screw 
                         me here, and it means that I know 
                         something none of you know because 
                         I've been there -- and I don't want 
                         to go through that horror again. 
                         Ever!

               There's a long pause.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, could you wait here for a 
                         few minutes while we make up our 
                         minds about something?

                                     BRODY
                         Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

               The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody alone 
               in the room. The last one in the door very carefully makes 
               sure it's tightly shut.

               Brody sits alone at the table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I've never seen him like this.

                         And Hendricks is qualified, you heard 
                         that from his own mouth.

                                     KAISER
                         We made a motion and it was already 
                         seconded.

                              (official)
                         Very well then. It is moved and 
                         seconded that Martin Brody be relieved 
                         of his duties as Chief of Police, 
                         his contract with the township be 
                         terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks 
                         be appointed Acting Chief in the 
                         interim. Those in favor?

               All the hands go up.

                                     PETERSON
                         Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?

               Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent. They stare at him.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm sorry, but I respect his 
                         convictions. The motion is carried.

               He goes to the door, and opens it.

               The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's 
               shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car. Then his 
               hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can 
               onto the lawn. Clink.

               After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until 
               the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way 
               home. Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the 
               car and starts for the door to his house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long 
               pause between car arrival and husband arrival. Brody enters.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hi. I closed a sale today, without 
                         Len. That's $1200 commission, if the 
                         papers go through.

                                     BRODY
                         That's great.

                                     ELLEN
                         Sean's asleep.

                                     BRODY
                         That's great too. Gorgeous.

               He takes a long look at her.

                                     BRODY
                         You look about 22 years old sitting 
                         there. Like you were doing homework...

               He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly 
               lit room. Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her 
               desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.

                                     ELLEN
                              (sensitive)
                         What's wrong?

                                     BRODY
                         Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, 
                         that's all.

               He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.

                                     ELLEN
                         What?

                                     BRODY
                         What'd I say?

                                     ELLEN
                         That you were fired.

                                     BRODY
                         Then that's what I meant. Fired. 
                         Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen 
                         just made Hendricks the new Chief of 
                         Police. Just like that.

                                     ELLEN
                         Because of today? The beach?

                                     BRODY
                              (expansively)
                         No sweat. A blessing in disguise. 
                         Back to the city, you can go to 
                         Bloomingdale's without waiting six 
                         hours for the ferryboat... we're 
                         surrounded by water here, you realize 
                         that? Me, surrounded by water... 
                         Ridiculous.

                                     ELLEN
                         Stop that! We're not going any place. 
                         You love it here. Tell me what the 
                         hell happened!

                                     BRODY
                         Showed them the photo, showed them 
                         the goddamn Shark, big as life. They 
                         didn't see it. Not like me. Not like 
                         the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped 
                         this li'l picture... He's out there, 
                         somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot 
                         off my big mouth, so they fired me...

                                     ELLEN
                              (studying the photo)
                         Honey, this is nothing... I don't 
                         know what it is. What did they...

                                     BRODY
                              (going on)
                         ...Everybody wants the job. No one 
                         wants the authority. Except Hendricks. 
                         Fine. He can go out there in that 
                         precious boat, and when he looks 
                         whitey in his big mouth he can just 
                         call me. Call me in New York... tell 
                         him to kiss my ass...

                                     ELLEN
                              (seeing his pain)
                         They have no right to treat you like 
                         that. You've given them everything. 
                         For four years, you've protected 
                         this town, the people on this 
                         island...

                                     BRODY
                         Fired me!
                              (at Ellen)
                         I'm not a hysterical man. I'm 
                         responsible. I know what I saw...

                                     ELLEN
                         I know you did...

                                     BRODY
                         I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, 
                         I'm tired... I can't keep fighting 
                         it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm...

               Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally 
               overcome him. He slumps in Ellen's arms.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're drunk is what you are...

               She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his 
               inert shape.

                                     ELLEN
                         Take it easy... Easy...

               ANGLE ON THE STAIRWELL

               Sean comes down the stairs, sleepy, in his pajamas.

                                     SEAN
                         Is dad home? I heard something...

               He comes into the darkened den.

               ELLEN AND SEAN

                                     ELLEN
                         Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's 
                         sleeping.

               Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.

                                     SEAN
                         What's this?

                                     ELLEN
                         Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed.

               She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the 
               room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEWSSTORE - NIGHT

               This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and 
               pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft 
               drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed. A jukebox is 
               blaring some n.d. rock music. Present are Donnie, Doug, Timmy, 
               Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane, Andy, 
               and Mike. The boys are passing around hot-rod van and custom 
               boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen, Tiger 
               Beat, People, and Time. Andy and Mike are at the counter, 
               splitting a sandwich.

                                     DOUG
                              (holding a book)
                         That's what I want -- a gaff rig.

                                     TIMMY
                         Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail 
                         schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- 
                         the Mayan, an Alden schooner.

                                     BOB
                         Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at 
                         the town hall.

                                     MIKE
                         I know.

                                     DOUG
                              (innocently)
                         Did he really freak out at the beach?

                                     MIKE
                         I don't know.

                                     ANDY
                         Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want 
                         to play pong for money?

               No one does. There's a bustle at the door, and some couples 
               enter from the movies: Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo 
               and Jackie. There are a lot of ad-lib greetings;

                                     LARRY
                         How was the show?

                                     ED
                         Yech.

                                     TINA
                         It was okay.

                                     PATRICK
                         I'd rather go the lighthouse.

                                     LUCY
                         Who wouldn't.

                                     POLO
                         Anyone want to go the lighthouse?

                                     BROOKE
                         Now? At night?

                                     POLO
                         Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. 
                         My folks left two cases of beer in 
                         the garage.

                                     PATRICK
                         Is it still there?

                                     POLO
                         Nope. Got it in my boat.

                                     LUCY
                         All-right.

                                     JACKIE
                         Let's go for it.

               There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's sailing 
               picnic.

                                     TINA
                         Mike, you going?

                                     MIKE
                         Why shouldn't I?

                                     LARRY
                         I thought you might still be painting 
                         the restrooms at the beach.

               Laughter from the gang.

                                     BROOKE
                         Anyone want a coke or anything?

               They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda 
               fountain, others hanging out by the magazines.

               ANGLE ON JACKIE AND MIKE

                                     JACKIE
                         I'd like to go out to the lighthouse 
                         with you.

                                     MIKE
                         I'm not sure I can.

                                     JACKIE
                         It'll be fun, come on!

                                     MIKE
                         Maybe you and Brooke could come over 
                         to the town beach...

                                     JACKIE
                         No way. Everybody's going sailing. 
                         If you don't want to take me, just 
                         say so.

                                     MIKE
                         That's not it. My dad told me not to 
                         go.

                                     JACKIE
                         You do everything your parents tell 
                         you?

                                     MIKE
                         No.

                                     JACKIE
                         Good. I'll be on the dock at eight.
                              (to the gang)
                         Eight o'clock, everybody!

               They ad lib agreement.

                                     JACKIE
                              (aside to Mike)
                         I really want to to be there.
                              (to the crowd)
                         Who's bringing the wine? And who's 
                         got a quarter for the box?

               Brooke takes Mike aside, as Jackie goes to the jukebox.

               Larry is right there with a quarter, standing next to her as 
               they select a tune.

                                     BROOKE
                         She just likes to tease. I think she 
                         really likes you.

                                     MIKE
                         Great.

               Some rock music starts, and we:

               INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY

               Ellen is asleep under the covers, Brody, still in his clothes 
               from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's 
               stumbled upstairs sometime during the night. There's a noise 
               down the hall, from Mike's room. Brody stirs, but doesn't 
               wake up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DAY

               Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we 
               just heard. He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied 
               with his image in the mirror. He takes off his clean shirt, 
               and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt. A brief sniff to 
               make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he 
               tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.

               INT. BRODY HALLWAY - DAY

               Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door. Sean's door 
               opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking 
               out.

                                     SEAN
                              (whispering)
                         You're going out.

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah.

                                     SEAN
                         You're going sailing.

                                     MIKE
                         Maybe.

                                     SEAN
                         Take me.

                                     MIKE
                         No.

                                     SEAN
                              (louder)
                         I want to go with you!

                                     MIKE
                         Quiet!  Shhh!

                                     SEAN
                              (even louder)
                         Michael...

                                     MIKE
                         Okay, okay. Close your door.

               Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to 
               Mike; the two of them start downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BRODY HOUSE

               Michael and Sean are walking away towards the road into town.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and 
               cutoffs: no uniform today. He starts downstairs, stopping 
               only to look into Mike's room. It's empty.

                                     BRODY
                         Good morning, America...

               A grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan..." He goes 
               downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - DAY

               Brody enters from upstairs. He heats coffee. Ellen enters 
               dressed for work. He pours two cups.

                                     ELLEN
                         What're you going to do today?

                                     BRODY
                         Turn in the car. Clean my desk, 
                         explain things to our sons, then 
                         maybe get shit-faced and punch your 
                         boss.

                                     ELLEN
                         I'll give notice.

                                     BRODY
                         Don't rush into it -- we may need 
                         the income.

               She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment.

                                     BRODY
                         Mike left early. Couldn't wait to 
                         make out. Must be a morning man.

               Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments.

               Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Morning. Anything special today?

                         ELLEN
                 Sean's not up yet. You 
                 know what he likes, 
                 just some Fruit Loops 
                 and milk. No candy.

                                                       BRODY
                                               The sink upstairs is busted. 
                                               Try some Drano, or a 
                                               plunger, maybe. Or call 
                                               your brother, the plumber, 
                                               what's his name...

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Frankie. He's my cousin.

                                     BRODY
                         Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs 
                         an apprentice.

               Brody and Ellen are at the door.

                                     MRS. SILVERA
                         Have a nice day.

               They leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY

               The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of 
               recreational offshore sailing. Mike and Andy are readying 
               his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way. In the b.g., 
               Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police 
               boat.

                                     ANDY
                         If you're beached, why are we doing 
                         this? For practice?

                                     MIKE
                         Yeah.

                                     ANDY
                         Then why are we futzing around the 
                         dock? We can make a few bucks working 
                         at the beach.

               Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him.

                                     MIKE
                         Look -- if you're going to get in 
                         the way, you can just go home.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in 
                         the way?

                                     ANDY
                         You're always in the way.

               Marge joins them, scooping Sean up.

                                     MARGE
                         This guy giving you any trouble?

                                     SEAN
                         Put me down!

                                     ANDY
                         Put him down in the water.

                                     MARGE
                              (to Sean)
                         You want to go out in my boat?

                                     SEAN
                         Yeah.

                                     MIKE
                         Would you take him?

                                     MARGE
                         Sure.

                                     ANDY
                         You've just made someone very happy.

               Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening. Brooke and Jackie 
               come down the dock, dressed for sailing.

                                     BROOKE
                         Mike! Are you going out?

                                     MIKE
                         Maybe.

                                     JACKIE
                         I thought you were grounded.

                                     MIKE
                         I can go out if I want to.

                                     ANDY
                         You can?

                                     JACKIE
                         You going to the lighthouse?

                                     MIKE
                         Why not?

                                     ANDY
                         I could give you a dozen good reasons.

                                     MIKE
                              (to Andy)
                         Shut up.

                                     ANDY
                         Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind 
                         you.

                                     JACKIE
                         Is there room on your boat for all 
                         of us?

               Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself... Timmy moves in, 
               sensing the chance of a lifetime.

                                     ANDY
                         Well, we're pretty crowded, and I 
                         don't know when we're leaving...

               Timmy makes his move.

                                     TIMMY
                         I've got room.

                                     BROOKE
                         Great.
                              (to Andy)
                         That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.

                                     TIMMY
                         You will?

                                     BROOKE
                         Sure.

               And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to 
               follow. He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.

                                     TIMMY
                         Fan-tas-tic!

               He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're 
               together again at last for the first time. Andy is left 
               shuffling with Mike and Jackie.

                                     JACKIE
                         I'm ready.

               And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken. 
               Anywhere.

                                     JACKIE
                         Come on, you guys.

                                     ANDY
                         Well, I don't know...

               Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles. Why break 
               one heart when you can break two? Or more?

                                     JACKIE
                         Please come with us?

               Mike is glaring. The message is clear, if unspoken.

                                     JACKIE
                         For me...?

                                     ANDY
                         What the hell. For you...

               Andy joins them.  Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie 
               sits there, looking cute.

               ANGLE ON LARRY AND BOB

               watching what's going on.

                                     BOB
                         I thought you said she was going 
                         with us?

                                     LARRY
                         Let's just go sailing, okay?

                                     BOB
                              (casting off)
                         Want to talk about it?

                                     LARRY
                         Want to swim home?

               Bob gets the message and shuts up. The Sizzler fills its 
               sails, and points out of the harbor.

               WIDE ON THE HARBOR

               Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some 
               working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational 
               boating mix. The Kids are finding the same general direction, 
               pointing out of the harbor.

               QUICK CUTS

               -- Sails being trimmed.

               --  Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he 
               sets a course straight for the lighthouse.

               --  Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.

               EXT. HARBOR MOUTH - DAY

               The Kids' boats, in a loose bunch, slipping out to sea.

               REVERSE - LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of 
               Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult 
               instructors: Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky.

               EXT. DIVING BOAT - DAY

               Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing 
               the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by, 
               close.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be 
                         in class!

                                     ANDY
                         Today I'm staying topside. You dive 
                         for me!

                                     ANDREWS
                         I'm going for lobster.

                                     JACKIE
                         Great! Find one for me.

                                     ANDY
                         With butter, if they got any...

               Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave.

                                     ANDREWS
                         So long, turkies.

               He turns to his class.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Sparky will take you down today. If 
                         everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop.

               The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while in 
               the b.g. the Kids sailboats head out to sea. Andrews' two 
               partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the class 
               over.

                                     CROSBY
                              (to Andrews)
                         Let's get some dinner.

               He goes over, Andrews following. Sparky is with the class, 
               signaling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UNDERWATER

               The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering 
               encouragement as they descend. Andrews and Crosby are already 
               disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.

               FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY

               as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, 
               deeper waters. Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks 
               around...

               HIS POINT OF VIEW

               far above him, the class, going about their business.

               Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass.

               Andrews sees it, too.

               ANGLE - ON ANDREWS

               Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the 
               big lunker. Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, 
               misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow 
               Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, 
               losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and 
               meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:

               BELOW HIM THE SHARK

               The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, 
               it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it 
               turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red 
               and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, 
               eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring 
               face.

               Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes 
               wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, 
               he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on 
               his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging 
               towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away 
               from his lips.

               Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding 
               his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.

               THE DIVERS

               look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky 
               signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards 
               the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY

               Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips. One of the 
               class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his 
               convulsions. Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to 
               administer mouth-to-mouth.

                                     SPARKY
                         Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us 
                         in!

               In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs.

               Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually 
               turns towards... the ocean. The Shark is headed for the sea. 
               And for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the 
               horizon in their familiar bright colors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY

               They are alone. In the middle distance, the rest of the Kids' 
               sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the distance. 
               The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no headway.

                                     TINA
                         You want to tack, or just leave her 
                         pointed up like this?

                                     ED
                              (snuggling close)
                         Just like this.

                                     TINA
                         What about sailing?

                                     ED
                         The tide's running. It'll take us to 
                         the light.

                                     TINA
                         It'll take us to Budapest if you're 
                         not careful.

               Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the 
               current.

                                     ED
                         First things first.

               He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.

                                     TINA
                         What about the others?

                                     ED
                         They'll be there when we get there. 
                         Might even have a fire started.

                                     TINA
                         What're we going to do in the mean 
                         time?

                                     ED
                         I dunno. We'll think of something.

               He pours the wine into the two paper cups.

                                     ED
                         But first, a little juice...

                                     TINA
                         And second?

                                     ED
                              (kissing her)
                         Mmmmmm.

                                     TINA
                              (resisting)
                         Wait a minute. Promise me something.

                                     ED
                         Anything. Anything.

                                     TINA
                         That you'll put down a blanket. I've 
                         got black and blue marks all over my 
                         butt, and my Mom's getting uptight 
                         about them.

                                     ED
                         You got it.

               And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging 
               gear around as he rummages for it. Tina sips wine contentedly, 
               satisfied to wait.

               UNDERWATER

               The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises 
               with dreadful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of 
               Ed's hasty search.

               ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN

               The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, 
               then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire 
               Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as 
               the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.

               Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.

               ANGLE ON ED

               as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, 
               trying to orient himself, finding the boat. He starts to 
               swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard.

               ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED

               He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes 
               him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through 
               the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he 
               is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood 
               smears his nose and lip.

               His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.

               REVERSE

               Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's 
               arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with 
               desperate hands.

               INSERT

               Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip. With 
               awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters 
               and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by 
               the awful force.

               TINA

               her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down 
               at the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy 
               under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing 
               swell.

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

               On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the 
               Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, 
               Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster 
               cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking 
               more often, faster and more maneuverable.

               CLOSE ON PATRICK AND LUCY

                                     LUCY
                         Faster! Faster!

                                     PATRICK
                         Coming about...

               She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy 
               familiarity. They come about and scoot off on a new tack.

               CLOSE ON POLO

               Reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and alone.

                                     POLO
                              (to a near-by boat)
                         Great day! I think the wind's going 
                         to change...

               CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE

               He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady 
               her, she snuggles into his arms. True love, at last... He's 
               thrilled.

               CLOSE ON DOUG

               In his inflatable, poking slowly along. Marge passes him, 
               Sean hooting with glee.

                                     MARGE
                         Coming up.

                                     SEAN
                         Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!

                                     DOUG
                         I'm getting new sails, then watch 
                         out. Just a question of modifying 
                         the rigging!

               ANGLE ON MIKE'S "GREEN MACHINE"

               Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob 
               in the Sizzler nearby. Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals 
               in delight.

                                     JACKIE
                         Wheee! Faster!

                                     ANDY
                         How fast is enough?

                                     JACKIE
                         I want to go faster!

                                     MIKE
                         Hang on...

               He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying, 
               Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline.

               ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER

               Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what 
               he's doing.

                                     BOB
                         You coming up on him?

                                     LARRY
                         You bet. Hang on...

               They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.

                                     LARRY
                         Coming up! Give way!

                                     ANDY
                         Like hell! We're on the starboard 
                         tack!

               THE SIZZLER AND THE "GREEN MACHINE"

               Running close to each other; very tight two-by-two.

                                     JACKIE
                         Don't let him pass. Faster!

               Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing. Water 
               splashes over them.

                                     JACKIE
                         My hair's getting wet!

                                     ANDY
                         So's mine.

               CLOSE ON MIKE'S BOAT

               He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair.

               Larry and Bob speed by, yelling.

                                     JACKIE
                         When do we get to the lighthouse?

                                     ANDY
                         Soon, dark eyes, soon.

                                     MIKE
                         The tide's turning.

               Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.

                                     ANDY
                         We're going to be fighting the 
                         current.
                              (he looks up)
                         Wind's backing around a few points, 
                         too.

               Jackie snuggles against Mike.

                                     JACKIE
                         I can't wait to get there.

                                     ANDY
                         But of course.

               He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds 
               snuggling astern. They pull away from us, and we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. AMITY WATERFRONT STREET - DAY

               Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work.

               There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now 
               familiar blinking red light. Brody, out of force of habit, 
               wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd, 
               which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hey -- it's not your job any more. 
                         I'm going to be late for work.

                                     BRODY
                         Just one minute...

               He gets out, and pushes through the crowd, Ellen following.

               DOCKSIDE

               The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police 
               Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance.

               The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts; 
               some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on 
               the deck. Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to 
               Andrews.

               ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT

               Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest. The 
               shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant 
               is wheeling a gurney into position. Crosby and Sparky are 
               stunned.

                                     BRODY
                         What the hell happened?

                                     SPARKY
                         Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. 
                         Came up too damn fast. Held his 
                         goddamn breath!

               He is near collapse himself.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Easy...

                                     CROSBY
                         He panicked! Something scared him!

               An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         It's okay. We're taking care of him.

               The other attendant holds something out to Brody. Brody 
               examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.

                                     BRODY
                         How'd this happen?

                                     SPARKY
                         Bite reflex, like a spasm.

                                     BRODY
                         When?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Right after, the Kids went out?

                                     ELLEN
                         What Kids? Who went out?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, 
                         Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all 
                         that whole gang.

                                     ELLEN
                         Mike? Our Mike?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Yep. Looked like they were headed to 
                         the lighthouse.

                                     BRODY
                         How long ago?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         About an hour, maybe two.
                              (thinking)
                         Let's see -- I came on about eight...

               Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd.

               THE POLICE BOAT

               Brody is casting off lines. Ellen is on the dock, watching 
               him.

                                     ELLEN
                         What're you doing?

                                     BRODY
                         Going out.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief 
                         any more.

               Brody keeps working, making ready for sea.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I can't let you take her out.

                                     BRODY
                         You can't stop me.

               Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, 
                         then you can't go. Neither of you 
                         can go.

                                     ELLEN
                         I'm going.

                                     BRODY
                         Mike's out there.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         But I signed for the boat. You're 
                         not authorized any more.

               Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into 
               reverse. The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a 
               halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.

                                     BRODY
                         Untie that rope.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Please. It's my job.

                                     ELLEN
                         I'll do it.

               And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Brody, please...

               Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he 
               puts the helm hard over. It bumps the dock, hard.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         You're too close. Back off.

                                     BRODY
                         Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope 
                         there.

               Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow 
               line. The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as Brody 
               guns it away from the dock.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Let me. Please.

               He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about, 
               pointing the launch out to sea.

                                     ELLEN
                         Hurry, please.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What the hell, they can't fire both 
                         of us -- someone's got to be in 
                         charge, right? Which way are we going?

                                     BRODY
                         Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you 
                         said something about the lighthouse. 
                         Get us there.

               WIDE ON THE HARBOR

               The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is 
               headed under full power out to sea. Hendricks is pumping the 
               horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of 
               the road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see 
               the ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through 
               the crowd at dockside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY

               As they clear the harbor mouth, Brody is on the radio, Ellen 
               is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse, Hendricks is 
               steering.

                                     BRODY
                         Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over.

                              (filtered)
                         Harbor Patrol. Is that you, Brody?

                                     BRODY
                         Affirmative. Can you get your chopper 
                         airborne?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         10-4, in a few minutes. He's down 
                         checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.

                                     BRODY
                         Get him the hell over to Amity Point, 
                         the old lighthouse. Right now.

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         What for?

                                     BRODY
                         There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing 
                         that way. Turn them back to port.

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         That's it?

                                     BRODY
                         That's it. Just do it, all right?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         10-4, soon as I can raise him.

                                     BRODY
                         If they're not at the light, look 
                         for them. I don't want them out there. 
                         Get them back to port!

                                     PATROL VOICE
                              (exasperated)
                         Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the 
                         Kids day-sailing back to port. I 
                         heard you. Patrol out.

               As Brody's eyes sweep the horizon anxiously, Hendricks pours 
               it on, and the police boat surges forward.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - KIDS SAILING

               Donnie and Denise and Susie are sailing close to each other.

                         Hungry?

                                     DENISE
                         Starving. Let's go eat now.

                                     DONNIE
                              (shouting to Susie)
                         We're going in to eat!

               She nods agreement, their boats veer off from the rest and 
               head towards the lighthouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (confident)
                         Sure.

                                     LARRY
                         How about a side bet to make it 
                         interesting?

                                     JACKIE
                         That's fun! Let's race for something!

                                     MIKE
                         Name it.

                                     LARRY
                         Loser sails home alone.

                              (aside to Mike)
                         You're betting what you already got.

                                     MIKE
                         I don't care.

                                     JACKIE
                         I love it.

                         Sure you do -- you win either way.

                                     JACKIE
                              (simply)
                         I'm supposed to.

                                     LARRY
                         It's a bet. Once around the marker 
                         buoy?

                                     MIKE
                         That's the pin -- the buoy.

               Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly 
               gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, 
               downwind. Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose 
               precious moments as they fumble with their sails.

                                     ANDY
                              (pulling away)
                         Turkeys! Eat wind!

                                     MIKE
                         Yee-hah!

               He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat 
               moves ahead, a drumming sound.

               UNDERWATER

               The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie 
               sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud-
               thud-thud" sound down to the deep.

               ANGLE ON DOUG IN HIS INFLATABLE

               falling behind as the boats change course for the marker 
               buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead.

                                     DOUG
                         Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!

               Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them.

                                     BROOKE
                         Can't -- we're watching a race!

                                     DOUG
                         Since when? Who's racing?

                                     TIMMY
                         Larry and Mike!

               PATRICK AND LUCY

               Pat and Lucy are trimming sail, moving faster.

                                     LUCY
                         Mike and Larry are racing! Loser 
                         goes home alone!

                                     PATRICK
                         If we beat them, they can both go 
                         home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie 
                         can come back in this boat!

                                     LUCY
                         What about me?

                                     PATRICK
                         Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo 
                         a hand going in...

                                     LUCY
                              (snapping him with a 
                              rope)
                         Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's 
                         turning with the tide. Sailing back 
                         is going to be a bitch.

               QUICK CUTS - SAILBOAT RACING MONTAGE

               --  Ropes and sails rattling through blocks.

               --  Sails snapping taut, filling with wind.

               --  Catamarans heeled over, racers hanging over the water, 
               dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses.

               --  Skippers' faces, concentrating on boat handling.

               AERIAL VIEW - SAILBOATS

               It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter 
               from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's 
               previous instructions. He sees the sailboats and fly that 
               way.

                                     PILOT
                              (filtered, into his 
                              mike)
                         Air Patrol to Base. I have visual 
                         contact on the Kids. Going down to 
                         use the loud hailer...

               LOOKING UP AT THE APPROACHING COPTER

               It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor 
               blades chuffing up a storm.

               The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is 
               blaring down at them.

                                     PILOT (V.O.)
                         This is the Harbor Patrol. Return to 
                         port immediately. Return -- to -- 
                         port -- immediately.

               THE BOATS

               The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly, 
               others luffing, wondering what this is all about.

                                     ANDY
                              (to Mike)
                         Your dad must be really pissed.

                                     MIKE
                         We better go back in.

                                     ANDY
                         It's not going to be easy.

                                     JACKIE
                         What's wrong?

                                     MIKE
                         We're fighting wind and current. I 
                         though we'd be out longer, catch the 
                         incoming tide.

                                     ANDY
                         Putz -- that won't be for hours.

                                     MIKE
                         I was counting on hours.

                                     CHOPPER (V.O.)
                         Return -- to -- port.

                                     MIKE
                         We're trying, we're trying.

               He waves acknowledgement, and puts about. The others take 
               their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without 
               much success.

               PATRICK AND LUCY

                                     LUCY
                         Heading back?

                                     PATRICK
                         Might as well.

               ANGLE ON THE THREE SLOOPS

               Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean. They see the faster 
               catamarans come about and try to beat back.

                                     POLO
                         They're turning around.

                                     LUCY
                         Coming about, then.

                                     SEAN
                         Are we going back?

                                     MARGE
                         Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody...

               She puts about, the three of them start back towards the 
               lighthouse, not making much headway. Doug's inflatable is 
               the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at 
               the head of the line beating back towards the island.

               DOUG'S BOAT

               The others in the b.g.

                                     DOUG
                         Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!

               INSERT - A WEAK PATCH IN THE RUBBER

               It whistles and visibly leaks under the strain.

               DOUG

               looking down in dismay.

                                     DOUG
                         Make that the Titanic.

               He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying 
               to breath air back into the raft.

               INT. CHOPPER - LOOKING DOWN AT THE SAILBOATS

                                     PILOT
                         Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're 
                         turning back.

                                     CONTROL
                         All right, Patrol. Go back to work. 
                         You've wasted enough time.

               UNDERWATER

               Looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats, the 
               turbulence from the low-flying chopper making a vast circular 
               pattern of irregular vibrations.

               LOOKING UP AT THE CHOPPER

               It wheels around, and heads back towards land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY

               Rushing through the seas under full power. About three hundred 
               yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat; Ed and Tina's 
               Sandpiper. Further off, a day-sailing power cruiser, sport 
               fishing.

                                     ELLEN
                         Michael?

                                     BRODY
                         It's not his boat.

               Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in 
               time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump. Ellen watches 
               apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         Be careful...

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Anything?

                                     BRODY
                              (on the Sandpiper)
                         Nope...
                              (he sees something)
                         Hold on...

               Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he 
               discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a 
               terrorized victim.

                                     BRODY
                         Tina!

                                     TINA
                              (a moan)
                         N-o-o-o-o-o-o...

                                     BRODY
                         It's okay, it's okay. What's the 
                         matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --

                                     TINA
                         No! It's still there!

                                     BRODY
                         What is it? What's there?

                                     TINA
                         It's still there!

                                     BRODY
                              (to Hendricks and 
                              Ellen)
                         I need a hand here...

               Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting 
               it over the shivering girl's shoulders. Ellen comforts the 
               girl.

                                     ELLEN
                         Tina, baby... what is it?

                                     TINA
                         Sh... Sh... Shark...

               ANGLE ON BRODY - FOLLOWING HIM AS HE REACTS

                                     BRODY
                         I knew it. I goddamn well told them.

               He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch, 
               snapping on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on 
               the sailboat moored alongside.

                                     BRODY
                         Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.

                                     PATROL COMMANDER (V.O.)
                              (filter)
                         This is Cape Patrol -- what is it, 
                         Brody? I heard you weren't chief 
                         anymore.

                                     BRODY
                         Skip that. What about those kids out 
                         sailing?

                                     COMMANDER (V.O.)
                         It's all okay -- Colby got to them. 
                         They were turning back when he left 
                         'em.

                                     BRODY
                         He left them?

                                     COMMANDER (V.O.)
                         Sure. He's got work to do in Bay 
                         Channel.

                                     BRODY
                         Get him the hell back there! We got 
                         possible fatalities! Brody out...

               His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans 
               the nearby waters with sudden tension.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper. Nearby, 
               a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by. Brody pulls the 
               police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over, 
               Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

                                     BRODY
                         I'm going out there.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Hey -- you can't do that.

                                     ELLEN
                         What is it? What's the matter?

                                     BRODY
                         Mike's out there.

               Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring 
               line that ties the two boats together.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Hendricks)
                         Get her in. Get them both in.

                         ELLEN
                 Martin, please!

                                                       HENDRICKS
                                               Chief, be sensible...

                         Where are they?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         About 10 degrees off your starboard 
                         bow, take a heading leeward of Sand 
                         Island, and lay her north by 
                         northeast...

                                     BRODY
                         Never mind that shit. Just point.

               Hendricks complies.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (pointing)
                         See where Cable Junction is? Look to 
                         the left. The lighthouse. That's it.

                                     BRODY
                         Got it.

               And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away 
               and out toward the sea.

                                     ELLEN
                         Come back! Martin!

               He guns the engine as soon as he's clear. Hendricks gives 
               his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin 
               cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding 
               its horn.

               Ellen stares after the receding boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         My purse is on that boat.

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE KID'S SAILBOATS

               They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting 
               wind and tide. Only Doug's inflatable, with its clumsy little 
               motor, is making any headway.

               ANGLE ON DOUG

               playing at being Charles Laughton.

                                     DOUG
                         Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump 
                         up this boat! And shave that silly 
                         moustache!

               Pumping, steering, he's floundering along.

               UNDERWATER - MOVING TOWARDS THE SURFACE

               The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape, 
               the easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping 
               and putting. It homes in on the sound.

               ANGLE ON DOUG AND THE KIDS

               The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he 
               clowns for their benefit.

                                     DOUG
                         England expects every man to do his 
                         duty... You may fire when ready, 
                         Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full 
                         speed ahead...

               Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud 
               bang.

                                     DOUG
                         Oh, shit.

                                     ANDY
                         Someone pop your balloon?

                                     DOUG
                         No problem, no problem.

                                     JACKIE
                         Want a lifesaver?

                                     MARGE
                         How about a skyhook?

                                     DOUG
                         You sail your boat, I'll sail mine.

               A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids, 
               but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.

                                     DOUG
                         Company? The place is a mess...

               Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking 
               his raft a terrible blow.

                                     DOUG
                         Whoops.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE OTHERS, WATCHING

               Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the 
               class clown, wondering what he's up to this time.

               DOUG'S BOAT

               a distance from the rest. It shakes, then blows up as big 
               teeth grip it from below. Doug goes flying into the drink.

               The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it 
               from side to side. Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's 
               going on. He begins treading water, backing away as fast as 
               he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me 
               up, quick..."

               MIKE'S BOAT

                                     MIKE
                         Doug's down!

               He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current.

               The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine; 
               the Shark didn't like it.

                                     ANDY
                         Doug! This way!

               Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where 
               Mike and Andy can pull him abroad. Some of the others sail 
               closer to get a look.

                                     PATRICK
                         What was that about?

                                     MARGE
                         You okay?

                                     LUCY
                         What was that?

                                     LARRY
                         So much for the rubber duck.

               THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER

               This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw 
               what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about 
               anything. Until now.

                                     DOUG
                         A shark ate my boat.

                                     BOB
                         Come on.

                                     DOUG
                         I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate 
                         my goddamn boat!

                                     ANDY
                         If he liked your boat, I got some 
                         sneakers he'll love.

               There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the 
               remains of Doug's inflatable. Some of those jagged rents 
               could be made by teeth...

                                     KIDS
                              (ad lib)
                         ...Jeez -- what did that?... A 
                         porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale... 
                         I think he snagged it... I hate to 
                         pop his balloon... (Etc.)

               ANGLE ON MIKE'S BOAT

               Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward.

               Without warning, the Shark hits. Screams, terror, confusion.

               Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water.

               CLOSE ON MIKE

               His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over.

               ON THE GROUP

               Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it, 
               knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams.

               CONFUSION

               As the following events take place:

               --  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado.

               --  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the 
               drink.

               --  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean 
               up with her, just in time.

               --  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before 
               the Shark can get to him.

               --  The Shark dips out of sight.

               SURFACE, WIDE OVER THE STERN OF POLO'S BOAT

               showing the results of the turmoil:

               ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS

               As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping 
               together, Andy is the first to gain any composure.

                                     ANDY
                         Raft up! Raft 'em up!

               He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's 
               Doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close.

                                     LARRY
                         Tie off to your strongest point.

                                     PATRICK
                         Anyone need an extra line?

               Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.  Timmy is looking 
               up from examining Mike's dazed body.

                                     TIMMY
                         Mike's bleeding!

                                     ANDY
                         Can you sail?

                                     POLO
                              (testing his rudder)
                         Yeah! We'll take him in!

               He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a 
               severe, but manageable tack. Polo, Timmy, and the injured 
               Mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind.

               Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival. Jackie is 
               strangely quiet; things are out of control...

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               CLOSE ON A NAUTICAL CHART - DAY

               clearly marked: Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable 
               Junction. Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation of 
               his course. It fumbles, pauses, stops.

               ABOARD THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

               Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean. Ahead is 
               the Lighthouse, his immediate destination. Out of sight to 
               the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of 
               cold Atlantic. Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the 
               radio.

                         power, surging through the heavy 
                         swell, Brody very much alone at the 
                         helm.

               EXT. OCEAN, NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               We can see Brody's boat approaching. It slows as it nears 
               the island.

               CLOSE ON BRODY

               staring, perplexed. Which way?

                         Shit.

               He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around. To the left --  
               the wrong way.

               ANGLE ON THE BOAT, LIGHTHOUSE IN B.G.

               It barrels off to the left.

               HELICOPTER (AERIAL) FLY-BY

               A panorama of open ocean; a quick fly-by to orient us: First, 
               Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft.

               THE RAFT

               More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming 
               what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption. From 
               afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper.

                                     LARRY
                         Hey!

                              (waving)
                         Over here!

               The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue 
               chopper.

                                     ANDY
                         Don't everyone jump around!

               But they ignore him. The copter is descending.

               INT. COPTER - DAY

               A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered 
               with tools and floats, lashed in place. Below, seen through 
               the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper 
               sets down.

                                     PILOT
                         Air One to Base. I have a positive 
                         location on that sailing party. 
                         Disabled and adrift...
                              (he checks chart on 
                              his knee board)
                         ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable 
                         Junction, wind and current carrying 
                         them just about due east. I count 
                         ten juveniles.

               THE RAFT

               The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets 
               down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as 
               the rotors slow to a halt. The Kids are waving and jubilant.

               ANGLE ON THE COPTER

               As the Pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one 
               pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn.

                                     PILOT
                         Everyone okay? Any injuries?

               The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative.

                                     ANDY
                         Can you put us on Cable Junction?

                                     PILOT
                         I got no room for passengers.

                                     ANDY
                         How about a tow? Can you rig that?

               The Pilot nods. Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches 
               it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the 
               undercarriage.

                                     LARRY
                         As soon as you get us on the island, 
                         you got to call in. My dad's the 
                         mayor...

                                     ANDY
                              (interrupting)
                         There's a shark...

               The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts 
               describing what happened, calling for help, etc. It's all a 
               noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job.

               ANGLE ON THE RAFT

               The Kids all shouting at once; Jackie is screaming.

                                     JACKIE
                         You have to take us off! You have 
                         to! Why don't you take us!

                                     DOUG
                              (calming her)
                         It's an observation spotter, he 
                         doesn't have the room...

               ANGLE ON THE PILOT

               He finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the 
               Kids.

                                     PILOT
                         Listen. I'm going to give you an 
                         assist to get you on Cable Junction. 
                         Then I'll call in, and get the Coast 
                         Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to 
                         something.

               He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a 
               "thumbs up," and starts the engine.

               QUICK CUTS - RAFT AND CHOPPER

               Engine turning over.

               A line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned 
               hull; it pulls taut out of the water.

               INT. CHOPPER, THE PILOT INTENT ON HIS JOB.

               The raft, Kids watching in fascination and anticipation.

               The whole operation, getting under way.

               UNDERWATER

               looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the 
               surface, the heavy "thud-thud-thud" of chopper blades.

               WIDE ON THE RAFT AND CHOPPER

               In the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene.

               Follow it.

               CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER

               as it starts to lift, inexplicably. The Pilot reacts as;

               THE SHARK

               attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping 
               great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.

               THE RAFT

               Kids screaming.

               QUICK CUTS

               --  Rotor blade spinning wildly.

               --  Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls.

               --  Med. shot, copter shaking.

               --  Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning.

               --  Med. closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit.

               RAFT AND COPTER

               The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs on 
               the roaring copter; in the b.g., Cable Junction is looming 
               closer. The copter tilts dangerously, the Shark bites deeper, 
               harder.

               ANGLE ON THE COPTER

               as it tilts. Then, the unspeakable -- the blades touch the 
               water and explode. Chunks of murderous steel break off the 
               shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles.

               THE KIDS

               reacting, ducking in terror. Huge chunks of disintegrating 
               rotors are flying all around. Masts and sails left standing 
               before are chopped into a deadly salad. Screams.

               LOW IN THE WATER

               as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned copter, 
               Pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea.

               THE COPTER COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

               Pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit 
               switches, working on instinct. Some air in the bubble, but 
               water too, and sparks as electrical connections short out 
               and burn.

               Then, the Shark, powering out of the murk.

               ANGLE ON THE PILOT - UNDERWATER

               as grim death batters at his fragile bubble. Screaming.

               The bubble cracks. Water floods, teeth snap at the slippery 
               plastic, the Pilot fumbles for oxygen as the Shark veers off 
               into the murk.

               ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT

               The Kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the 
               waves. Calm for a moment, then:

                                     LARRY
                         Look out!

                                     JACKIE
                              (screams)
                         No-o-o-o!

               The Shark reappears, and batters at the raft.

               SHARK ATTACK

               The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding.

               The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage.

               Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.

                                     SEAN
                         Help!

               He and Marge topple into the water.

                                     ANDY
                         Don't struggle!

               Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near 
               him.

               ANGLE ON MARGE AND SEAN

               in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft.

               Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving 
               up through the waves.

                                     MARGE
                         Sean!

               She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with 
               desperation towards the safety of the floating hull.

               ANGLE ON SEAN

               screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he 
               struggles for a grip on the slippery surface. Behind him, 
               Marge helping as much as she can from the water. Then, behind 
               her;

               THE SHARK

               rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight. Marge is 
               gone.

               UNDERWATER

               Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with 
               panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while 
               the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged 
               hull.

               Follow Marge as she swims.

               COPTER WRECKAGE

               Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking 
               air from his oxygen tank. He sees Marge, and slips out of 
               his bubble, headed for her.

               MARGE

               As the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she 
               thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot 
               motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air." She follows him.

               MARGE AND THE PILOT

               Scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken 
               chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube.

               The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as 
               currents move it. They struggle silently.

               ANGLE ON THE CHOPPER

               as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it, broken 
               parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of oil and 
               hydraulic fluid clouding the water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT

               A parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates 
               Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is 
               clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening.

                                     PATRICK
                         Sean! Sean!

                                     ANDY
                         Don't move!

                                     SEAN
                         Andy! Please help! Help!

               ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY

               Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a 
               submarine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces 
               of broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot, 
               and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out. They 
               cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with 
               oxygen-starved eyes.

               They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant 
               sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable 
               Junction. Safe, for now...

                                                                   CUT TO: 

               BRODY - ALONE IN THE POLICE BOAT - DAY

               He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water. He looks 
               around, sees nothing, in all directions. He hits his radio.

                                     BRODY
                         Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, 
                         come in.

               Static, no answer. He tries a couple of times, checking the 
               knobs and dials to make sure the unit's working.

                         Harbor Air, do you read? Over?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         Brody? This is Patrol Base.

               The familiar voice is tinged with annoyance. He's had a long 
               shift, and nothing's going right.

                                     BRODY
                         Where the hell is Air One?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         That's what I'd like to know. Lost 
                         transmission at Cable Junction.

                                     BRODY
                         Did he raise the Kids?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         Last transmission said ten juveniles.

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah? Then what?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         Then nothing. If you see him, tell 
                         him to switch to an operational 
                         frequency, or give me a status report 
                         yourself.

                                     BRODY
                         Did you say Cable Junction?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         That's what he said.

                                     BRODY
                         When?

                                     PATROL VOICE
                         1530 hours. Might still be there. 
                         Base out.

               Brody revs up, and powers out, headed for Cable Junction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT

               Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned 
               keel. The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him 
               back. Patrick heaves, and misses.

                                     LARRY
                         Sean! Catch the rope!

                                     BOB
                         The rope! The rope!

               The others shoot fearful glances at the waters.

                                     PATRICK
                         He's got to help or it won't work.

                                     LUCY
                         Sean, baby, please...

               Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by 
               fear, he shivers alone. Jackie is near catatonia herself, 
               Brooke and Doug trying to soothe her.

                                     JACKIE
                         It killed her. It ate her.

                                     BROOKE
                         Shh. Shhh...

                                     DOUG
                         It's okay, it's okay...

                                     ANDY
                         Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean.

               The kid looks up dully.

                                     ANDY
                         Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me 
                         or I will kick your ass, do you hear 
                         me?

                                     LUCY
                         Listen to Andy, Sean.

                                     ANDY
                         We're throwing a rope and you better 
                         catch it, hear?

               Sean nods. The other Kids are encouraged. The rope is thrown -- 
               it misses.

                                     ANDY
                              (to Bob)
                         Keep an eye out for that fish.

               Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.

                                     LARRY
                         Throw it.

                                     ANDY
                         Sean! Catch it!

               Another miss. In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to 
               fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong 
               into the sea. Shrieks of fright from the others.

                                     LUCY
                         Larry!

               He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving.

               Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope 
               practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and 
               holds it. As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures 
               the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull 
               him in.

               ANGLE - ON SEAN

               as they pull. The slippery rope is undoing itself.

               THE RAFT

               With the kids reaching out hands, sticks, rope, anything to 
               pull the little one to safety. The ocean swells rise and 
               fall with hidden menace.

               QUICK CUTS

               --  Hands gripping rope.

               --  The knot, pulling apart.

               --  Anguished faces, concentrating, as Patrick, Lucy, Larry, 
               and Andy struggle to bring him in.

               ANDY AND SEAN

               Success. He's pulled to safety. They lash his little hull as 
               tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage.

               Bob sees something.

                                     BOB
                         Cable Junction's ahead!

                                     LUCY
                         Can we make it?

                                     BOB
                         I don't know.

               BOB'S POINT OF VIEW

               looking over the wreckage to Cable Junction, now much closer.

               Beyond it, miles of empty Atlantic. It's off to one side, 
               and unless they can slow down or alter course, they will 
               miss it.

               THE RAFT

                                     LARRY
                              (to Jackie)
                         You okay?

               She's not. Shaking, silent, eyes glazed.

                                     LUCY
                              (alone)
                         Dear Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of 
                         God, help us, please...
                              (her lips move 
                              inaudibly)

                         Keep her warm. 
                              (to Jackie)
                         Jackie? Baby?

                                     PATRICK
                         Can someone help me rig a jury rudder?  
                         We might steer this...

               Andy joins him, and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out 
               of whatever wreckage they can use.

                                     DOUG
                         By 7:46, when the tide turns around, 
                         we'll be twenty miles out. More, 
                         with this wind.

                                     LARRY
                         Shut up.

                                     DOUG
                         I can't stop thinking!

               BRODY'S POLICE BOAT - DAY

               He is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks 
               ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors' 
               boats.

                                     BRODY
                         Thank Christ.

               He puts the helm over and heads for them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN NEAR LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

               Polo's sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the 
               police launch bears down, Brody leaning on the air horn.

               The Kids signal and wave.

                                     POLO
                         Over here! Yo!

                                     BRODY
                         I'm coming alongside!

               The launch slows clumsily. Timmy gets a line around a cleat, 
               and pulls them fast.

                                     BRODY
                         Mike? Is that you?

                                     MIKE
                         Pop. I'm sorry.

                                     BRODY
                         It's okay. What happened?

                                     POLO
                         A shark hit us out there.

                         Mike got knocked over.

               Brody goes for his radio, to report in, to call for help.

                                     MIKE
                         I passed out, but I'm okay.

                                     BRODY
                         At least you're safe. What about the 
                         others?

               The three boys look at each other.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about 
                         the others?

                                     MIKE
                              (tears in his eyes)
                         Sean's still out there.

                                     BRODY
                         What?

               He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten. heartsick. Mike 
               goes on,

                                     MIKE
                         He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't 
                         it? It was okay before...

                                     POLO
                         The others are ratted together. 
                         Drifting.

                                     BRODY
                         Which way?

                                     TIMMY
                         With the current. Towards Cable 
                         Junction.

               Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing 
               it. He starts for his controls, obsessed.

                                     MIKE
                         Dad, I'm sorry...

                                     BRODY
                         Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just 
                         stay here.

               He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine.

                                     BRODY
                         Stay at the lighthouse!

               He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN - DAY - THE RAFT

               approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are drifting 
               towards the Cable Junction.  Larry, Patrick and Andy are 
               working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out 
               of wreckage. Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying 
               to slow their drift.

                         it -- steady.

               UNDERWATER

               The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on 
               the rocks on the bottom.

               The group dissolves in bitter exchanges. No one is rational.

               Lucy is the first to notice something...

               The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself.

               There's a distant sound of a boat's engine. Bob spots it 
               first, and waves.

               The others follow his pointing finger.

               under full power, heading straight for them,

               THE KIDS

               go crazy, waving, yelling, screaming, "Over here!" "Help!"

               his bow wave almost swamping them as he slides past.

               Brody fumbles with the throttle, manages to hold his boat 
               steady between the raft and Cable Junction island.

                                     LARRY

                         Can you get us a line?

               Brody finds a coil of line, makes one end fast, then throws 
               it to the Kids on the raft. They catch it, and tie it off to 
               a cleat.

                         Be careful.

               Brody throttles forward, the police boat shudders under the 
               strain as the line goes taut.

               ANGLE ON THE RAFT

               where the rope is tied off to a cleat. The wood groans, screws 
               pop --

               Too late. The cleat rips out, Brody's boat leaps forward.

               as he repositions; he's now between the raft and the island, 
               preparing to throw his line. He heaves, the Kids grab, they 
               have it, they tie off again,

                                     ANDY

               Brody starts to pull the raft again, when:

               THE SHARK

               surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that 
               separates the police boat from the raft. It lunges at Brody 
               as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, 
               snapping it.

               ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT

               Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins 
               the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to 
               port. Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable 
               Junction.

               INSIDE THE BOAT

               as it tips up on the rocks. Brody falls, equipment and loose 
               material breaks loose and falls.

               INSERT - THE RADIO

               held by only a few screws, it pulls out of its mount and 
               shatters on the deck.

               ANGLE ON THE STERN

               lifting high out of the water, the screw turning in air.

               THE KIDS ON THE RAFT

               Their horrified reactions.

               BRODY IN THE BOAT

               picks himself up, and staggers to the rail, sees his 
               predicament.

                                     BRODY

                         I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay...

               He climbs over the rail, onto the slippery wet rocks, trying 
               to get to where he can help. The Shark patrols the gap, 
               waiting.

                                     BRODY
                         Can you get a line to me?

               ABOARD THE RAFT

               the Kids find some line. Andy coils, and throws.

               CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT

               Brady catches the Kids' line. He heaves on it with all his 
               might. Nothing. Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids 
               are screaming. The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it 
               slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled 
               into the water. The raft doesn't budge.

               UNDERWATER

               the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck 
               fast.

               CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS

               He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the 
               towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral.

               The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to 
               them.

               The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and 
               scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the 
               beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry 
               is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE WINCH LINE

               Unattended, it drops into the water.

               THE KIDS

                         Get the cable in! Pull!

               They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface.

               It comes taut, but doesn't budge. Brody watches, helpless 
               for the moment.

                                     BRODY
                         Son of a bitch is stuck!

               BRODY

               climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying 
               to pull the cable free.

               THE SHARK

               on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, 
               tearing it off the raft, shaking everything.

               ON THE RAFT

               the Kids react to this fresh attack.

                                     DOUG
                         It's killing us!

                         I don't want to die! Mommy!

               IN THE BOAT

               The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost 
               too much.

                                     BRODY
                         Come on, you bastard, come on, pull.  
                         Pull!

               THE RAFT

               bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through 
               the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler. The Kids, screaming, 
               fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure 
               into pieces. Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the 
               remaining segment.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in 
               the water.

                                     BRODY
                         Sean! Hang on!

               He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emergency 
               inflatable in its case. He wrestles it off its brackets, and 
               breaks the seals urgently. He hits the auto-inflate.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN

               Alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the 
               other Kids flailing in the water. The huge bulk of the Shark, 
               fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion.

               IN THE WATER

               While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the 
               water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their lives.  
               Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last.

               Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on 
               the exposed wooden hull.

                                     PATRICK

               As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is 
               sliding past her, intent on Bob. The rough hide scrapes her, 
               tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her 
               torso.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm bleeding!

               Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks.

                                     BOB
                         Help!

               He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at 
               him.

               INSERT - WINCH

               grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water -- 
               heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from 
               the mainland!

               BRODY IN THE WATER

               paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, 
               heedless of the danger around him.

                                     BRODY
                         Hang on! Just hang on!

               He fights to see in the gathering gloom. Suddenly, a strange 
               glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of 
               escalating clicks.

               CABLE JUNCTION

               Silhouetted against the evening sky. Automatic timers are 
               turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren 
               rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark 
               shadows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by 
               their contract.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               straining to see what's going on. Looking for his son.

                                     SEAN (O.S.)
                         Dad! Help! Daddy!

                                     BRODY
                         I'm coming!

               He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch.

                                     BRODY
                         Andy! Use the lights! The lights!

               ANGLE ON ANDY

               soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody, 
               fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat 
               throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps 
               and searchlights. Andy grabs one and sweeps the water with 
               it, trying to help.

                                     ANDY
                         Where are you? Chief!

               His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.

               BRODY IN THE WATER

               He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, 
               as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks. He is blinded by 
               the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken 
               teen-agers screaming. It's the middle of The Inferno.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN

               Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting 
               his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what 
               seems to be certain death.

                                     BRODY (O.S.)
                         Sean!

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, 
               to distract it.

                                     BRODY
                         You bastard!

               He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding 
               a steel boathook. He screams at the unfeeling Shark...

                                     BRODY
                         Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

               The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new 
               irritation. Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a 
               commotion.

               THE SHARK SPEEDS TOWARDS HIM

               THE SHARK

               lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing 
               at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it 
               passes...

               ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT

               Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet 
               cut of the water. He reaches up to it.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing 
               it, inspired with a lunatic idea...

                                     BRODY
                         Over here! You bastard! Over here

               THE SHARK

               turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its 
               scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody.

               BRODY

               Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.

                                     BRODY
                         Come and get me! Come and get me!

               THE SHARK

               Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the 
               way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening 
               onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a 
               moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack 
               open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- 
               then the live copper core is reached. Zap!

               THE SHARK

               dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of 
               volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot 
               white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, 
               sputters, and dies.

               BRODY

               watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when 
               the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights 
               on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut 
               down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's 
               worklights provide light now.

                                     BRODY
                         Sean?

               No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing 
               quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of 
               the raft, expecting the worst...

               ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE

               Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean. There's a 
               scrabbling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under 
               the seat where he'd fallen.

                                     SEAN
                         Dad?

               Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto 
               his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks.

               THE ISLAND

               with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're 
               wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as 
               they step onto land.

                                     SEAN
                         They made me go with them.

                                     BRODY
                         Sure they did...

               He kisses the damp forehead.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. AMITY HARBOR - DAY

               A crowd of worried parents and adults, Ellen and Hendricks 
               in the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth. It's 
               dawn and the sun is rising. They see something, a cheer goes 
               up.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               A big Coast Guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little 
               group of survivors on the foredeck.

               CLOSE ON THE CUTTER

               Brody and the surviving Kids wave to their families on land.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in
          pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted
          expression. As she stares out the window, she winds
          colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
          "god's eye."
          
          Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot
          SECURITY FENCE.
          
          Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
          casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even
          creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Every day, I get letters. I think
                    I get more letters than Santa
                    Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil
                    combined. I'm kind of the shit.
          
          RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his
          head in cautiously.
          
                                  RAYMUNDO
                    Rec time in five minutes, Needy.

                    Grassy-ass, Raymundo.
          
          Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional
          gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a
          series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Sometimes the letters are from
                    people who say they're praying for
                    me. They tell me everything will
                    be okay if I just accept Jesus
                    Christ into my heart. I say the
                    words, but nothing ever happens.
                    Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off
                    the cross.
          
          She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She
          touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.

                    Occasionally I get presents from
                    starfuckers who saw my picture in
                    the paper and want to marry me or
                    something. They think they can
                    take me away from all this.

                    Like I'd really date some
                    perverted Chester with a hard-on
                    for jailbait. I might be insane,
                    but I'm not desperate.
          
          We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in
          from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's
          even a DICK SHOT tucked in there.
          
          Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt. It hangs
          down to her knees, covering her shorts.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    A lot of people ask me if I'm
                    sorry I did it.
          
          Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her
          dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows
          them.

                    I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
          
          She saunters out of the room in her GYM UNIFORM and BUNNY
          SLIPPERS.
          
          
          INT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL GYMNASIUM - MORNING
          
          Several badminton courts are set up in the gym. As an
          intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address
          system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost
          violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks.
          
          The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A
          TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket,
          clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one
          forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another
          hurls her racket against the wall again and again.
          Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable
          their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking
          patients jump rope.
          
          Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her
          bunny slippers.

                    They're big on recreation here.
                    Supposedly it helps us vent our
                    aggressions. We've traded in our
                    hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O

                    action when they're fully
                    conscious.
          
          We see a GIRL swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of
          fresh bandages on her arms and legs.

          Nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious
          WHACK at it.
          
          INT. LEECH LAKE CAFETERIA - ONE HOUR LATER
          The freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast.
          They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. Needy
          selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line
          and sits down, alone.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Personally, I think they're trying
                    to wear us out. Keep us sluggish
                    so there won't be an uprising.
                    Well, those J.V. tactics won't
                    work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I-
                    C-K-E-R. It even says so on my
                    chart.
          
          We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's
          clipboard. We see her name: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI and a
          few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE
          NOTIONS. Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted
          warning in bright ink: KICKER.
          A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
          and eyes her breakfast plate.
          
                                  NUTRITIONIST

                       That's good. But I'm not sure a
                       Toastem can provide you with
                       sufficient energy for your day.
                       I'd recommend more complex
                       carbohydrates...

                    I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE
                    FUCK UP!
          
          The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET-- as if she's
          been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and
          collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the
          bone has SNAPPED.
          The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by
          staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish.
          Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone
          nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.
          
          It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she
          hollers in protest.
          
          The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her
          bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds
          her. She spits out a TOOTH.
          
          INT. "THE HOLE" - SAME
          Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her
          face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her,
          leaving only a shaft of light.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I wasn't always this cracked. I
                    used to be normal-- well, as
                    normal as any girl under the
                    influence of teenage hormones. But
                    after the killings began, I
                    started to feel, I don't know...
                    loose around the edges or
                    something. I was coming undone
                    like those jeans I made in Home
                    Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy
                    Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.
                    Dead inside.
          Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
          in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life,
          half eaten. Grimaces of terror.
          Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly
          to calm the patients   in solitary. Needy shudders and
          recoils at the sound   of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD
          that we'll soon hear   again...

                    God, I hate this fucking song.
          
          
          Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to
          listen to the song. She curls up in the corner and steels
          herself for solitary confinement.
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          TITLE: TWO MONTHS EARLIER
          
          EXT. DEVIL'S KETTLE, MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
          Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded
          by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town
          that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one
          stoplight.
          
          On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that
          reads "WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See
          What's Cookin'!"
                                  NEEDY
                    This is where it all went down.
                    "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I
                    know, but the place just is named
                    after a dumb waterfall.
          
          
          EXT. THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
          We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing
          over a rock face.

                    Well technically, it's two
                    waterfalls. One of them is normal--
                    it empties into a river basin. But
                    the other one goes into a hole.
                    And it doesn't come out. The
                    scientist guys can't explain it.
                    They've dropped all kinds of
                    things down there--bouncy balls,
                    red dye, radioactive slime-- but
                    nothing ever surfaces.

          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE (TO ESTABLISH) - MIDNIGHT
          The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except
          for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still
          illuminated.
          There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
          backyard. We're definitely in deep north country.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I've probably spent years of my
                    life in this house. Hundreds of
                    sleepovers, thousands of aimless
                    homework sessions, a million phone
                    calls. I've climbed through
                    Jennifer's window so many times.
                    But tonight, only one of us is
                    going to come out.
          
          INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAME
          JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches
          TV. She's a girl of 16 with LONG, MATTED HAIR and a thin,
          frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick
          and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed,
          Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock
          of hair.
          Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH
          FLAGS and underwear.
          
          An `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half-
          watches, distracted.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Jennifer didn't always look this
                    rough. Actually, she was the
                    prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle
                    when she wasn't so...hungry.
          
          Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer
          was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    She hadn't fed in weeks.
          
          Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly.
          We see the OUTSIDE of the house again. It's dark and
          silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV.
          Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window,
          white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face
          disappears.
          Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched
          below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if
          via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish,
          sploish, sploish.
          
          Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She
          turns out the light. A beat of silence.
          Then, the sound of cracking near the window.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Huh?
          Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and
          brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's
          head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically
          in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster.
          Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES
          Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.
                                  NEEDY
                    You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh?
                    You killed Chip! You goddamned
                    monster! You...ZOMBITCH!
          
          Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness.
          Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms.
          
          Needy pulls a BOX CUTTER out of her waistband and flicks
          it open like a switchblade. Kshink!
                                  JENNIFER
                         (GAGGING)

                    boxes.
          She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer
          instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense.
          We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy
          shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer,
          straddling her and bearing down.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her
          breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she
          grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split
          second, sexual control...
          Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right
          with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "X" on her
          torso.

          Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and
          disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence.
          Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE
          CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne
          heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL,
          collapsing back onto the bed with a thud.
          
          Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into
          Jennifer's HEART. Blood GEYSERS from the wound.
          
                                  JENNIFER

          Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT,
          revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY.
          Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle.
          MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a
          worse perm rushes into the bedroom.
                                  MRS. CHECK
                    Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my
                    God! Oh my God!
          She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over,
          gasping and bleeding.

          Needy drops the boxcutter. It lands on Jennifer's copy of
          Flag Team Quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore.
          
                                  NEEDY

          Mrs. Check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like
          a white-trash Pieta. Jennifer takes one last breath,
          vomits blood, and DIES.
          Mrs. Check SCREAMS. Needy SMILES.

          Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and
          lights engaged. OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young

          Officer Duda starts the ignition. His partner, a hard-

                                  NEEDY
                    The lead singer, of course. Girls
                    like her don't go out with

                    No offense. I mean, she'd probably
                    make an exception for a drummer

                       22, so he could get locked up in
                       the state pen if he actually dated
                       her. But Jennifer says he's extra

          of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling. It's a
          busy night and the bar is teeming with locals.
          A bartender sells a CASE OF BEER to a customer and passes
          it over the bar.

                    Chip was right. The Carousel is

                    urban areas. Clubs have DJs and
                    champagne and separate bathrooms
                    for guys and girls. All we have is
                    a broken jukebox, a few domestic
                    taps and the Sticker Toilet.

                    groupies. Come on! It'll be like
                    Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane
                    and you can be the other girl.
          She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag
          her toward the stage.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    No!
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just
                    boys. Morsels. We have all the
                    power, don't you know that?
          She plants her hands on Needy's CHEST.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    These things are like smart bombs.
                    Point `em in the right direction
                    and shit gets real.
          
          Needy shrugs free of Jennifer's grasp and follows her
          reluctantly across the room.
          
          The lead singer of Soft Shoulder, NIKOLAI WOLF, is
          already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the
          stage. His gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed-black
          hair.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Hi. Um, we just really wanted to
                    meet you or something? I'm
                    Jennifer Check and this is my
                    friend.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I'm Nikolai Wolf, and this is my
                    band.
          He reaches down and pumps Jennifer's outstretched hand.

                    Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've
                    heard you guys are super, super
                    good at playing your instruments.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I hope we can live up to
                    such...high praise.
                                  NEEDY
                    Hey, if you don't mind me asking,
                    why did you want to play all the
                    way out here in Devil's Kettle?
                    You live in the city, right?
                                   NIKOLAI
                    Yeah. But I think it's so
                    important to connect with our fans
                    in rural areas. Plus, the
                    audiences in small towns really
                    appreciate us.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Can I show you my appreciation
                    right now?
          Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed.
          
          Jennifer's voice scales up nervously.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Like, I'll buy you a drink? I
                    mean, I'll see if I can get you a
                    drink. They make this great 9/11
                    tribute shooter? It's red, white
                    and blue, but you have to drink it
                    fast or it gets all brownish.
                                    NIKOLAI
                           (GRIMACING)
                    Mmm.
          Jennifer hurries off toward the bar.
          
          Needy moves self-consciously into a nearby corner, not
          wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone.
          A LOCAL plugs a Loretta Lynn tune into the jukebox, with
          a challenging stare at the band. A DRUNK COUPLE begins
          two-stepping in front of the stage.
          Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, DIRK, and pulls
          him aside. Needy pricks up her ears and listens.

                    Dirk, what about her?
                                  DIRK
                         (gesturing to Needy)
                    Who, Training Bra Jones?
          
          Needy looks offended.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    No, the hot one. The one who just
                    walked away. She's it, man. She's
                    exactly what we're looking for.
                                  DIRK
                    You're sure she's...
                                  NIKOLAI
                    She's a kid. We're in God's
                    country, man. Everyone out here's
                    a fundie bible-banger. Of course
                    she's a virgin.
          Dirk hesitates.
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    Dirk, we didn't haul our asses out
                    to this corn palace for nothing!
                                  DIRK
                    Fine. Okay. You know, I know I'm
                    not "just the bassist." I'm a
                    person who happens to play the
                    bass guitar. And I would like some
                    respect...
          
          Nikolai is already ignoring him.
          Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and
          discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is
          arguing with a jealous-looking Roman. He shakes his head
          in disgust and leaves the bar.
          Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC
          THEMED DRINK. She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned
          expression.
                                  JENNIFER
                    What? Are you scared of rock stars
                    too?
                                  NEEDY
                    Those guys are rank, Jen. Just
                    forget about it.

                    I think the singer wants me.
                                  NEEDY
                    Only because he thinks you're a
                    virgin. I heard them talking.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Yeah, right! I'm not even a
                    backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to
                    Roman. By the way, that hurts. I
                    couldn't even go to flags the next
                    day. I had to stay home and sit on
                    a bag of frozen peas.
                                  NEEDY
                    Oh my God.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I
                    can do innocent. I'll be Little
                    Miss Fucking Sunshine.
                                  NEEDY
                    He's way too old for you.

                    Don't cock-block me, Needy.
          
          Piercing FEEDBACK signals the beginning of the set.
          Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Good evening, Devil's Lake.
          Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle!"
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft
                    Shoulder. And we just want to make
                    you happy.
          He WINKS at Jennifer.
          The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we
          heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never
          leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's
          arm. Even the locals look charmed.
          Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling
          next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she
          watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.

          CONTINUED: (7)
          
          The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to
          blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone
          ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the
          fire.
          Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas
          exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar
          aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons
          his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he
          watches from the stage...is he smiling?
          CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,
          causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE
          and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the
          roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA.
          Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.
          
                                  NEEDY
                         (to Jennifer)
                    I know where to go!
          Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
          tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the
          Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER
          sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the
          BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside,
          screaming.
          
          EXT. THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUS
          Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs
          her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's
          flushed face and looks into her eyes.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                         (DAZED)
                    It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on
                    fire. Oh God, I'm burning!
          
                                  NEEDY
                    You're okay, I promise. You got
                    burned worse when you wore that
                    tin-foil bikini to the beach.
                    Everything's fine.
          Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both
          girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false
          concern.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Are you girls all right?

          Needy is less than thrilled to see him.

                    We're great. Maybe you should try
                    to find your band?
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Those guys? They were the first
                    ones out the door. Ran for the van
                    like a bunch of Marys. Frankly,
                    I'm ashamed of them.
          Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously.
          Muffled SCREAMS rise up from the flame-engulfed building.
          Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down
          her face.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    God, it feels like hell out here.
                    Come and hang with us in the van
                    for a while, just until they hose
                    this place down.
          
                                     JENNIFER
                    Okay...okay...
          She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    You're in shock. Here, drink this.
                    You'll feel better.
          He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
          from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips. She swigs
          it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin.
          
          Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.
                                  NEEDY
                    Aren't you a little freaked out
                    about this? What about all your
                    stuff? It's probably melting, and
                    when you get to the next stop
                    you'll have to do like, a crappy
                    acoustic set! Nobody likes that.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    We'll be able to afford new gear
                    soon enough. I have a feeling
                    we're gonna blow up.

                    Badger Sauce! Please? I'm
                    starving.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Needy, stop it. Just stop it!
          She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which
          is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar.
          Needy staggers after them slowly, watching.
          Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence.
          Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get
          into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.
          
          Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van,
          revealing his slick, muscled white torso.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I watched her get into that van
                    and I knew something awful was
                    going to happen. But for some
                    reason, I felt drawn toward them.
                    Toward him. He was pale and
                    twisted and evil, like this
                    petrified tree I saw when I was a
                    kid.
          
          EXT. PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK - (FLASHBACK)
          We see LITTLE NEEDY, about five years old, staring up at
          a petrified tree in the darkness, horrified yet
          compelled. The tree seems to stoop forward, cracking...
          
          BACK ON NEEDY:
          Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression.
          Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a
          vicious smile.
          Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction,
          away from the van and the fire.
          
                                                               29.
          
          
          
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - 11:00 P.M.
          Needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed. Her clothes
          are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty.
          She grabs her cheap, taped-up cell phone and dials CHIP's
          number shakily.

          Chip's bedroom is pitch black until a cheap cell phone
          lights up under the covers illuminating his sleeping
          form, clad only in jockey shorts.

                    you were sleeping with your phone.

                    Jennifer's gone. She ran off with
                    that rock band. And the Carousel
                    burned down.
          CHIP sits bolt upright
          
                                  CHIP

                                  NEEDY

                    We went out the bathroom window.
                    Everyone else was trying to use
                    the door. It was like a stampede.
                    The people who fainted got run
                    over and you could hear their
                    bones breaking.

          Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. As she
          passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances HUM all
          around her. The silence is menacing.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - CONTINUOUS
          Needy opens the door. Nobody there.
          She slams the door, turns around and SCREAMS.

          Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly
          pale and smiling. Her clothes are tattered and stained--
          her entire front is soaked in blood. Her makeup is
          smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a
          zombie's. She looks HORRIFYING, especially with that
          ghastly, clownish grin.
          
                                     NEEDY

          Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood-
          tinged teeth.

                    What happened?
          Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down
          and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum.
          Jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at Needy.

          Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM, wailing at
          the top of her lungs. She vomits a torrent of evil-
          looking black bile all over herself and Needy and
          staggers wildly down the hallway.
          
          The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed
          school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in
          horror as it slides down the wall.
          The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it,
          like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by
          itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the
          corners. It's truly revolting.
          Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
          mouth.
          Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to
          jagged, insane laughter.
          Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
          against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her.
          Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against
          Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle.
          Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses
          her lips against Needy's carotid artery.
          We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing.

          Needy nods.
          Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and
          PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts
          out the front door and takes off running down the street.
          Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward
          the doorway.

          INT. KETTLE HIGH - THE NEXT MORNING
          Moments before the first morning bell. Needy is sitting
          at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from
          her scuffle with Jennifer the night before. She looks
          like she hasn't slept a wink.
          The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the
          fire and gather in groups.

                    way out with a machete.

          unscathed. She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing

          light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and
          bile off the floor with a dirty sponge. The black, spiny
          vomit repulses her, and she gags.
          
          She reaches for a Swiffer WetJet mop and pulls the
          trigger. No solution comes out. She curses, hysterical
          and sleep-deprived.

                    Don't talk to yourself. It's one
                    of your more freakish Needy
                    behaviors and it makes us both
                    look like total gaylords.
          Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading
          her fingers to display her filthy fingernails.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Eww, you need a mani bad. You'd
                    better find a Chinese chick to

          MR. WROBLEWSKI, a middle-aged teacher, enters the room.
          He has a gnarly-looking robotic hand and moves awkwardly.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                         (SMIRKING)
                    Here comes Handi-Snack.
          
          Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat. His voice quavers.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    I'm sure those of you who made it
                    here today have all heard the
                    news. It's a dark day for Devil's
                    Kettle, a day we can never, ever
                    forget.
          A single, stifled sob rises from the class. Needy glances
          around the room and sees students fighting back tears. A
          huge JOCK weeps openly, tears spattering his swimsuit-
          model decorated notebook. Jennifer smirks, barely able to
          contain her laughter.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)
                    The administration here has
                    decided that today will be a
                    unstructured day of support and
                    remembrance. We've lost nine
                    precious students-- including
                    Ahmet from India-- several
                    parents, and a teacher, Ms.
                    Parrish.
          He fights back tears.
                                  JENNIFER
                    No way! Parrish ate shit?
          
          Needy shushes her, appalled.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    This tragedy is obviously beyond
                    anything we can measure. More than
                    ever, we need to band together and
                    draw strength from each other.
          Mr. Wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his
          pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)
                         (his voice cracking)
                    We can rise up. We can overcome
                    death.
          
          Needy eyes Jennifer warily.

          The automated bell rings. Needy slings on her backpack

                    didn't talk. She just stood there,
                    smiling at me, but a bad kind of
                    smile. She looked like she'd been
                    beat up or shot or something. She
                    was all bloody.

          EXT. KETTLE HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS

          standing at the deserted football field.

          It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles
          eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good
          a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone.
          In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It
          starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see
          it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and
          unmistakable.
          Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder,
          indifferent.
          A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely,
          Jennifer ISN'T THERE.
          Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling
          him.

                    I know. I was close to him too.
                    You know, I was there last night
                    in that horrible place. I saw
                    Craig a few minutes before the

          tears. Jennifer cuddles closer to him.

                                  JONAS
                    What?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Forget it. It's too intense.
                                  JONAS
                    What? Please, Jen, you've gotta
                    tell me!
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Well, he said he always thought
                    you and me would make a totally
                    bangin' couple. Isn't that so
                    weird?
          
                                  JONAS
                    He said bangin'?
          Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up
          her shirt, placing it on her left breast.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                         (WHISPERING)
                    Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's
                    broken.
                                  JONAS
                         (choking up)
                    Mine too.

                    Come with me. Just for a while.
                    We'll help each other get through
                    this nightmare. It's what Craig
                    would have wanted.
          Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away
          from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school
          campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we
          see the FALLS rushing into the lake.

          Needy and Chip are walking home from school, still deep
          in discussion.

                    me. Jennifer was-- she was
                    destroyed. She was dying in my
                    hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my
                    CPR training to check her pulse.
                    And I felt her dying, on the
                    inside, I mean. I've known her so
                    long that it's like sometimes I
                    can feel what she feels. We're
                    like E.T. and Elliot Ness.
                                     CHIP
                    I believe you.

          Jennifer and Jonas are in the woods. Jennifer efficiently
          whips off her top and bra and begins kissing Jonas
          hungrily. As Jonas touches her, he recoils.
                                  JONAS
                    You feel so warm. Why are you so

                    Shutties!
          She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his
          arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity.
          
          The woods are dead silent. A few squirrels approach the
          clearing, and Jonas watches them warily with one open eye
          as Jennifer kisses him. Then a deer wanders into the
          clearing. Then a fox. The animals pause in their tracks
          and watch, motionless. It's an eerie, unnatural tableau.
          
          Animals continue to gather.
                                  JONAS

          Jennifer is annoyed.
                                  JENNIFER
                    What?
          
                                  JONAS
                    Look!
          He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as
          statues. A few crows alight on a nearby tree.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Mm-hmm. They're waiting.
                                  JONAS
                    Uh, okay...
          Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down
          and working him with her hand. Jonas moans, still eyeing
          the animals.

          She smiles and shakes her head.
          Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from
          Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree.
          We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible
          snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood...

          A horrible SCREAM of agony rises from the woods. Mr.
          Wroblewski is exiting the school, briefcase in hand. He
          stops in his tracks when he hears the scream. He shakes
          his head sadly.

          He heads for his Ford Festiva, then pauses as if thinking
          better of it. Something isn't right. He puts his keys
          back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to
          investigate.

          She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a
          very familiar song: "Through the Trees," by Soft
          Shoulder.
          Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR
          crossing her face. She stops and braces herself against
          the counter, her KNEES SHAKING. Something isn't right.

          She closes her eyes. A brief, near-subliminal FLASH of

                    Anita, that ferret stinks. He

          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING
          A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight.
          The sun has begun to set. An ambulance and four police
          cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned
          off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS'S
          PARENTS are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating
          the ground with her fists.
          A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance.
          OFFICER WARZAK exits one of the police cruisers. Her
          signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect.
          She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother.
                                  OFFICER WARZAK
                    We will get the man that did this
                    to your son. You hear me? We'll
                    get that sick M.F.
                                  JONAS'S DAD
                    I'll get him myself! I will! You
                    hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off
                    your nutsack and nail it to my
                    door! Like one of those lion
                    doorknockers rich folks got!
                    That'll be your balls!
          
          EXT. ACROSS THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS
          The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the
          lake. The water is eerily calm.
          
          Suddenly, a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake. It's
          Jennifer, gliding through the water. She looks calm and
          serene.
          The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens,
          shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful
          scene.
          Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the
          pier, naked and dripping wet. She runs her tongue over
          her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out
          from between her two front teeth, like she's just
          finished a delicious rib dinner.
          Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her
          clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if
          nothing out of the ordinary has happened.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S ROOM - EVENING
          Needy is sitting at her lamp-lit desk, reading an old
          E.C. horror comic and eating a banana.
          The phone rings. Needy picks it up.

          INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's
          changed into shorts and a tank top. Music blasts from her
          stereo. She admires herself in the mirror, popping her
          ass.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    I feel sooo scrumptious!
          She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm
          hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from
          the wound.

          Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the
          blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED.

          Needy's call-waiting beeps.

          She casually lights her HAIR on fire. The flames leap up,
          then die down, leaving her entirely untouched.

          Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie-
          chart illustrating the intersecting calls. CHIP is
          panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the
          background, Chip's little sister CAMILLE bangs on a

          window.

          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - FOURTEEN MINUTES LATER
          The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a
          popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's
          Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of
          couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly.
          As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed,
          silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights.
          Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the

                    Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink.
          She's shaking now, too. Chip leans forward and kisses
          her. She closes her eyes.
          In the chaste space between CHIP and Needy's bodies, the
          volleyball-pit couple fuck like rabbits.

          A SERIES OF NEWSPAPER HEADLINES
          The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a
          dreamy montage of headlines.
          The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads:
          "WHY?"
          The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads:
          "'BUTCHERED': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in
          wake of devastating fire."
          
          A smaller headline on the front page of the New York
          Times reads: "Minnesota town rocked by grisly murder,
          blaze."
          
                                   NEEDY V.O.
                    We were famous. We were saints.
                    Our town's only bar had burned to
                    the ground and our star
                    quarterback was somebody's Quarter
                    Pounder. The whole country got a
                    huge tragedy boner for Devil's
                    Kettle. And the press-- God, they
                    couldn't get enough of our little
                    world of shit.
          We see Devil's Kettle citizens holding a tearful
          candlelight vigil by the former Carousel site. They
          softly sing along with the Soft Shoulder song.

          We see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats
          of Jonas' abandoned locker. The hallway floor is covered
          with teddy bears and bouquets.
          We see the PASSING OF TIME as the bouquets wilt and the
          blooms droop.
          
          The pile of discarded scratch-off tickets next to Needy's
          mother's bed grows steadily as the days go by.
          Another Star Tribune headline. This one reads: "Two weeks
          later, cannibal killer still at large." A smaller subhead
          reads "ARTS: Local band Soft Shoulder sign to major."

                    The days marched on as usual, but
                    most of us were too numb to enjoy
                    ourselves. Most of us.
          We see Jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school
          hallway in a sleazy Technicolor outfit. The rest of the
          kids look grey, ashen and depressed, but Jennifer pops
          like a Roman candle.

                    Still, we were healing. Like CHIP,
                    we figured things could only get
                    better. We had faith.
          
          We see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the
          school courtyard. They smile, then laugh, as if they're
          re-learning how to be happy.

          Mr. Wroblewski stands solemnly in front of the class, his

                       PMS isn't real, Needy. It was
                       invented by the boy-run media to
                       make us seem crazy.

                    news to share with all of you. The
                    members of the rock group Soft
                    Shoulder have decided to extend a
                    helping hand to our community.
          A ripple of excitement in the room. A girl seated in the
          front row is wearing a Soft Shoulder T-SHIRT.

                    As you know, their song "Through
                    the Trees" has become our
                    unofficial anthem of unity and
                    healing. So, they've decided to
                    release it as a benefit single.

                    Why don't you just come by my
                    place tonight? I just got
                    Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this
                    girl who's like, half-sushi. I
                    guess she has sex through her
                    blowhole or something.

                                  JENNIFER
                    I'll text you my address.
          Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly.

                    That was random.

                    Colin's a really nice guy.

                    He's into maggot-rock. He wears
                    nail polish.
          
          Chip appears behind Needy and drapes his arm over her
          shoulder. Needy jumps, startled.

          Needy waves as Chip walks away.
          
          EXT. CAMERFORD STREET - NIGHT
          
          Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a
          classic car. He's blasting punk music on an iPod that's
          been rigged to the ancient AM radio.
          Colin holds up his CELL PHONE to re-read the directions
          Jennifer texted him.
          The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by
          a new townhouse development. The identical units still
          appear to be under construction. There aren't even any
          streetlights. The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps
          eerily in the breeze.
          Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look
          like anyone lives here yet. He checks the phone display
          again.
          CLOSE ON PHONE:
          The TEXT MESSAGE reads:
          "trn lft on camerford and your there. first house on rt.
          1004 camerford. C-ya! xoxo jen"
          
          Sure enough, the house number is 1004. Colin throws the
          car into park and walks up to the porch. He looks up and
          notices a glow coming from an upstairs window,
          
          
                                                        (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Colin presses the doorbell. Nothing happens-- the house
          isn't wired for electricity yet.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME
          Needy and CHIP are kissing on Chip's water bed.
          Chip fumbles for one of those "fragrance plug-ins" and
          PLUGS it into the wall. Needy looks over.

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          Colin enters the house tentatively. It's dark, vacant,
          and very creepy. There's a very faint glow and soft music
          coming from upstairs.
          
                                     COLIN
                       Yo?
          He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of
          sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is
          definitely still under construction. Colin looks
          confused.
          A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers.
                                  COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Jennifer? Anyone there?
          The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response.
          
          Colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the
          creaking stairs.
          
                                                                  62.

          Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly
          plain white bra, complete with center bow. CHIP, also
          shirtless, cops a feel.
          He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent
          orange CONDOM. Needy looks at the wrapper.

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - CONTINUOUS
          Colin follows the music into an empty bedroom. The dark
          room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling
          into bizarre shapes. A single BLANKET is spread out on
          the floor. Colin shivers.
          Behind him, in the doorway, Jennifer appears, her smiling
          face hellishly aglow.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                    You made it.
                                  COLIN
                    What's going on? This isn't really
                    your house, is it?
                                  JENNIFER
                    No baby. This is our house, just
                    for you and me. We can play Mommy
                    and Daddy.
          Colin is totally dumbstruck.
                                  COLIN
                    Do you even know my last name?
                                  JENNIFER

                    signals all year. Couldn't you
                    tell? You give me such a wettie.

          She starts KISSING Colin on the neck. We can see
          confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME
          Chip fumbles below his waist, obviously struggling with
          the condom. Needy leans forward for a closer look.
                                  NEEDY
                    Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly
          kisses him on the mouth. Colin succumbs, but stiffly.
          We hear a SCRATCHING noise. Colin pulls away
          instinctively and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the
          walls, skittering over surfaces.
                                    COLIN
                    Jennifer...
          
          Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles.
                                  JENNIFER
                    You scared? I thought boys like
                    you were into vermin.
          
          She unbuttons his jeans. They fall noisily to the floor--
          they're the baggy Hot Topic kind with chains and buckles
          galore.

          Colin into Jennifer's eyes. There's something horrible
          about her face...like she's become almost corpselike.

          Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages
          his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin
          cries out in pain.

                    I need you hopeless.
          She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw
          unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman
          degree. Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely
          crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog.
          She descends on him, feeding ravenously.
          
          We see their shadows against the wall: Jennifer lunging
          hungrily, blood spraying up from Colin's jugular. We can
          hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood.

          Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then
          SCREAMING at that top of her lungs.
          
          She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood
          and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows. Then the
          infamous spiny black bile...
          Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. Skulls,
          jesters, demons, death. It's the worst acid trip
          imaginable.
          Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream.

          Colin's thrashing limbs finally go limp. Jennifer is
          hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood
          into her mouth with cupped hands.
          We see his eyes, flecked with blood, pupils dilated. A
          white MOUSE crawls over his face.
          
          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE - SAME
          Needy races toward the door with Chip in pursuit.
                                     CHIP
                    Needy!

                                  NEEDY
                    I have to go. I'm sorry. I just...
                    feel like something...something
                    terrible...
                                  CHIP
                    You feel-- What does that even
                    mean? I'm worried about you.
                                  NEEDY
                    I'm so sorry, Chip. I'm so sorry.
                    Everything is just wrong.
          She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone. He
          pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable.
          
          EXT. CHIP'S STREET - SAME
          Needy runs toward her mom's CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on
          the curb.
          She climbs into the car and starts the ignition,
          trembling and crying.
          
          She pulls out onto the street and guns it. She swings a
          hard left. The streets are all almost identical, lined by
          working-class homes.
          She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through
          the Trees" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard,
          hysterical.
                                  NEEDY
                    Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!
          
          Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark,
          tree-lined street. Then, she sees something bright emerge
          from the shadows. Her eyes widen...
          It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal.
          She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her
          face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore.
          She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.
          
          Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of
          control and slides into a ditch.
          Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get
          out of the trench. She glances desperately out the side
          window. Jennifer is gone.
          Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again.
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Suddenly, Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and SLAMS
          her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed
          like an insect's. The windshield SHATTERS. Jennifer grins
          at Needy through the cracking glass.
          Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and
          manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body
          tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the
          street.
                                  RADIO DJ
                    That was, of course, Soft

          EXT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
          Needy throws the car into park and races up the front
          walk. She unlocks the door, shaking and fumbling. She
          bursts into the darkened house.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                                  NEEDY
                    Mommy! Mommy? Please be home!
          
          No reply. Needy braces herself against the kitchen
          counter and bawls. She falls to her knees and curls up on
          the floor, exhausted.
          
          Her eyes drift shut.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I've always been able to feel what
                    she feels. Just not like this.
          
          
          EXT. SUNNY SUBURBAN YARD - FLASHBACK - DAY
          
          Little Needy and Little Jennifer are playing Barbies in a
          sandbox. Needy holds a brand new, immaculate Barbie doll.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and
                    you be her.
          
          She tosses Needy a naked brunette doll with its hair
          chopped off and an arm missing.

                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken.
                    Choose.
          
          She puts her hand down in the sand emphatically and
          suddenly HOWLS in pain.
          
                                  LITTLE NEEDY
                    What's wrong, Jennifer?
          
          Jennifer lifts her hand. There's a TACK stuck in her palm
          and it's bleeding.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    OWWWWWW!
                         (trying to swear like
                          a grown-up)
                    Damn! Ass!
          
          Needy grabs Jennifer's hand, pulls out the tack and wipes
          away the blood. It's still bleeding. Panicking, she leans
          forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound.
          
          Jennifer watches quietly. Needy pulls away.
          
                                  LITTLE NEEDY
                    Better. We should get a Band-Aid
                    though.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    We're sisters now, you know.
          
          Needy nods.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Don't tell my mom about this.
                    She'll make me get a shot.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    I never tell on you.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - (BACK TO REALITY)
          Needy WAKES UP in a cold sweat, gasping. She's still on
          the kitchen floor. She peels herself up off the floor,
          disoriented.
          
                                                               69.
          
          
          
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - CONTINUOUS
          Needy trudges into her dark bedroom. She strips off her
          clothes and stumbles into bed.
                                  JENNIFER'S VOICE
                    What's up, Monistat?
          
          Needy flicks on her bedside lamp, petrified. Jennifer is
          curled up in bed beside her, reclining casually. She's
          freshly showered and wearing one of Needy's dorky T-
          shirts.
          Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of
          bed, pulling the covers with her.
                                  JENNIFER
                    God, enough screaming already.
                    You're such a cliche.

                    But we always share your bed when
                    we have slumber parties.
          She winks conspiratorially at Needy.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    What the fuck is happening?

                    I'm calling the police.

                    Go ahead, narc me out. I've got
                    the cops in my back pocket. I'm

                    you. You've already seen too much
                    and besides-- best friends don't
                    keep secrets. Right?
          Needy nods, terrified.

                       Well, I got pretty messed up. I
                       almost died. You know those guys
                       in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil.
                       They're basically agents of Satan
                       with awesome haircuts. I figured
                       that out as soon as I got into
                       their molester van.
          
          INT. SOFT SHOULDER'S VAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          Jennifer is crouched in the back of the van. None of the
          band members are speaking. Nikolai Wolf drives down a
          gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the
          woods.
          
                                  JENNIFER

          Jennifer looks around the van, wide-eyed. There's glow-in-
          the-dark Satanic imagery painted all over the walls:
          goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing. She
          sees a few books sliding around on the floor: "Spells and
          Incantations," "Summoning the Beast," and a copy of the
          Black Mass.
          
          Jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the
          side door. MICK, the drummer, grabs her ankles, taking
          her down.

                    a virgin?
          
          A GLINT OF HOPE in Jennifer's eyes. Maybe if she lies she
          can save herself.

                    I've never done sex ever. I don't
                    even know how. So maybe you should
                    find some other girl who does.
                    Know how.

          EXT. FOREST CLEARING (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          The van rumbles down an uneven forest path, deep into the
          woods. They arrive at the real Devil's Kettle-- roaring,
          ominous waterfalls. There's a crude stone altar
          illuminated by moonlight.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
          Needy is still cowering on her bedroom floor, captivated
          by the tale in progress. Jennifer is reclining in the bed
          with a relaxed, supernatural glow.
                                  NEEDY
                    What did they do to you?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Just let me finish. So they drove
                    all the way out to the falls. I
                    tried to figure out an escape, but
                    it was so dark out there...
          
                                                                 72.

          The door of the van slides open. Nikolai pulls Jennifer

          looks up into the sky.

          The four band members surround Jennifer, looking
          statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles.
          
          Without warning, Nikolai hauls off and KICKS Jennifer.
          She yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt.
          
          Dirk looks apprehensive.

                    I don't know if we should go

          Dirk obediently heads over to the van. He pushes the
          intimidating-looking magical books aside and retrieves a
          single folded piece of computer paper.
          
                                     MICK

                    What? I found it on Google.
          
          He unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat.

          The guys have dragged Jennifer onto the makeshift altar

                                  NIKOLAI
                    That's fascinating.
          
          Dirk and Mick exchange nervous glances.

                    Please let me go. I'll do
                    anything. Anything you want.
          
          Nikolai examines her with an appraising eye.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I only hump nines and tens. You're
                    a seven at best, even with the
                    chicken cutlets.
          
          He reaches into Jennifer's bra and casually pulls out a
          GEL BREAST ENHANCER, tossing it aside.
          
          Jennifer rears up and SPITS in his artfully rumpled hair.
          Nikolai smooths his `do, enraged.

                    with the Beast himself?
          
          He wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face.

                    We went from college radio to

                    by color. In short, we want more.
                    And to get more, we have to
                    butcher you. And bleed you.

                    Start chanting, boys.
          
          The group begins chanting jibberish in unison. Jennifer
          struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black.

          He unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it Psycho-
          style, admiring his reflection in the blade.

          Snickering, Nikolai begins to sing "Starman" by David
          Bowie. The group joins in merrily.

          As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a
          grin. We hear Jennifer SCREAMING, sounds of violence and
          clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and
          stabs her, his face contorting demonically. The band
          continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees.
          
          Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls
          rushes into a black hole. He drops the murder weapon
          into the churning water, smiling.

          Needy's expression is both incredulous and horrified.
          Jennifer is totally matter-of-fact. She picks at her
          nails with a wooden cuticle stick from Needy's night
          stand.

          Jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze. She
          hears a faint COUGH. Jennifer stops and sees a hunched
          FIGURE walking down the opposite side of the street. It's
          AHMET FROM INDIA, the foreign student. He's covered in
          soot and looks traumatized.
          
          Jennifer takes a step. Ahmet takes a step. Jennifer
          stops. Ahmet stops.
          
          Their eyes meet. Jennifer crosses the street. Ahmet
          stares at her, frightened. Jennifer addresses him in a
          quiet, gravelly voice.

                    I can do stuff like this.
          Jennifer jams the CUTICLE STICK into her own forearm and
          drags it through her flesh. Needy screams and covers her
          mouth.

          Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm.

                    Forget it. You'd probably tell on

                    You should talk to someone about
                    these disturbing thoughts you're
                    having. We're all concerned.
                    Especially Chip. I think he's
                    having second thoughts about you.

                    Come on. Let me stay the night.
                    We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend"
                    like we used to.
          She smiles seductively.
          
          Needy crawls further away from her, shivering.
          Jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed. She walks
          over to the second-story window and cranks it open.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    What are you doing?
                                  JENNIFER
                    You said to leave. So I'm outtie-
                    5000.
          
          She climbs onto the windowsill. Needy watches, confused.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    See you at school.
          She LEAPS gracefully out the window.
          Needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments. Then
          she creeps over to the window and looks out. Nothing
          there but the wind. Jennifer's gone.
          
          EXT. OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL BLOOD CEMETERY - DAY
          We're in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel
          path runs through the stately old monuments into a small
          valley where a funeral is taking place.
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a
          procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest
          of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery,
          flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon
          hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc.
          These are Colin Gray's friends.
          
          One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on
          the path as she stumbles along, weeping.
          At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative-
          looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded
          by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back,
          looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press
          photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic
          priest.
                                  PRIEST
                    We gather here today to celebrate
                    the life of Colin Gray, who was
                    plucked from the prime of...
          The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the
          motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral. The
          priest clears his throat disapprovingly.

                    These are Colin's friends.
          A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly.
                                  GOTH BOY
                    Colin! Take me with you! I belong
                    down there! In the DAAAARKNESS!
                                  GOTH GIRL
                    No, Kevin. Those are just his
                    fleshly remains. He's among the
                    dark angels of the realm now. Fly,
                    Colin. Fly into the firmament.
          She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air.
          Colin's father gags, appalled.
                                  GOTH BOY
                    Is it cool if we camp here for a
                    few days? We want to commune with
                    his corpse. He was our spooky
                    homeboy.

                    Oh, right. I need to ask you
                    something, Mrs. Gray. It's really
                    important for me to have closure.
                                   PRIEST
                    Young lady, have some respect for

                         (waving him off)
                    No. It's fine.
          
                                  GOTH GIRL
                    Is it true that Colin had a date
                    with Jennifer Check the night he
                    was killed?
          
          She says "Jennifer Check" as if it were the most
          disgusting name imaginable. Needy covers her face.
                                  GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
                    Because Jennifer Check is a social
                    disease. She's not like us. She
                    thinks she's so special just
                    because she's popular and and is
                    what "society" considers
                    "attractive." But she's not
                    sincere. She's about as emo as a
                    breast implant! And she listens to
                    Jessica Simpson and shops at
                    Hollister. And I just know Colin
                    would never go out with someone
                    like that, and I just need
                    confirmation. From you. So did he?
                                  MR. GRAY
                    Did he...?
                                  GOTH GIRL
                    Have a date with Jennifer Check.
          Colin's parents stare at the ground.

                    Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad
                    at the person who murdered Colin.
                    All Jennifer Check did was invite
                    him over to watch Aquamarine.
                                    GOTH GIRL
                    That's WORSE!
          She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the
          dirt like a toddler.
          Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and
          begins weeping. Mr. Gray attempts to comfort her.
          
                                  GOTH BOY
                    Colin wouldn't have liked this.

                         (losing it)
                    Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah,
                    you're right! I'm pretty sure my
                    son wouldn't have liked being
                    eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and
                    buried before his eighteenth
                    birthday! Wow, you must have known
                    him so well!
                                    MR. GRAY
                    Jill...
          The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done
          ranting yet.
                                   MRS. GRAY
                    By the time they found Colin in
                    that godforsaken house, he looked
                    like lasagna with teeth. I'd know--
                    I had to identify the remains. My
                    boy's not in the realm of the
                    undead. He's not flying around in
                    the firmament with magical wings
                    of flame. He's in an overpriced
                    rosewood box that's headed six
                    feet downtown.
          She kicks the coffin to illustrate.

                    shove it up your asses, kids.
                    I got the monopoly on pain!
          The kids stare at her in awe. Needy watches as Mrs. Gray
          collapses into Mr. Gray's arms.
          
          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - DAY
          Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence
          surrounding the football field. It says "TURNABOUT DANCE
          OCTOBER 5 -- TICKETS ON SALE."
          Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka.
          She looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in
          days. There are hollows beneath her eyes.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    They did a big memorial assembly
                    for Colin at school, and we had to
                    watch another presentation about
                    curfews and the buddy system and
                    how to deal with grief. But nobody
                    seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was
                    last week's emotion.
          
          We see Jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing
          with some other flag team members.

                    Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since
                    our encounter in my room.
                    Actually, I hadn't really spoken
                    to anyone. I was busy with
                    research. Paranormal research.
          Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. As
          she stares at Jennifer, she see has a series of brief,
          gruesome HALLUCINATIONS:
          Jennifer as a grinning death mask. Jennifer as a corpse,
          the lower half of her face rotted away. Jennifer as a
          harlequin monster. Needy hears the rush of her own blood,
          the barely audible buzzing of flies...
          Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie.
                                  CHIP

          Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option
          but to submit. He nods reluctantly.
          
          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS
          Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school.
          Melting snow drips off the eaves.
          Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It's
          full of copies from the library and Internet printouts.
          The spine reads "JENNIFER RESEARCH"

                    try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan

                    Jennifer. Those guys from that

                    in the woods. But what they didn't
                    realize is that she hasn't been a

                    Jennifer's a total cum-dumpster!

                    the result may still be attained,
                    but a demon will forever reside
                    the soul of the victim. She must
                    forever feed on flesh to sustain

          INT. KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM (TO ESTABLISH) - NIGHT
          The gym is decorated to look like an enchanted forest. A
          large banner reads "Through the Trees- Turnabout Dance"
          There are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly
          shades of green and purple.
          
          A DJ plays badly-mixed pop music.
          Couples drift into the gym. The GOTH KIDS who were at
          Colin Gray's grave travel in a pack, sulking.
          The goth girl who loved Colin wanders through the
          decorations and pops every balloon she passes with a pin.
          As she pops them, she narrates dramatically.
                                  GOTH GIRL
                         (popping balloon)
                    This is my heart.
                                  GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
                         (popping balloon)
                    My soul.
          
                                  GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
                         (popping balloon)
                    Everything I once believed in.
          Another GOTH GIRL, looking exasperated, grabs a balloon,
          shoves it under her babydoll dress and pops it.
                                   GOTH GIRL #2
                         (MOCKINGLY)
                    Your abortion.
          
          She rapidly shoves another one under her dress and pops
          it again, smirking.
                                  GOTH GIRL #2 (CONT'D)
                    Your other abortion.
                                  GOTH GIRL
                    I hate your guts, Madison.
          The girls glare at each other.
          
          Needy walks in, looking small and apprehensive in her bad
          `80s dress. She looks around for Chip, but he's not there
          yet. A few mean kids point at her dress and snicker.
          Needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans
          against the wall, waiting anxiously for her Prince
          Charming.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance.
          He whistles to himself.
          Across the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him.
          The dog pants aggressively. CHIP tries to smile, but
          looks uncomfortable.
          A few SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously
          at him.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
          Couples are beginning to grind against each other on the
          dance floor. Needy watches them longingly. She checks her
          Mickey Mouse watch.
          
          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Chip picks up the pace, jogging down the path. In the
          distance behind him we can barely make out Jennifer's
          form. She looks more spectral then we've ever seen her.
          
          Chip speeds up instinctively.
          Suddenly, Jennifer's about ten paces closer.
          Then she's closer again, as if she can fold space and
          time. She's ethereal, flickering.
          CHIP turns to look over his shoulder.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
          The music fades out and there's a squeal of feedback from
          the sound system. Mr. Wroblewski walks onto the stage in
          a bad suit. He awkwardly picks up the mic with his one
          good hand and pats it with his robotic one.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    Can I have everyone's attention
                    please?
          The students turn to look at him, annoyed by the
          distraction.

                    Welcome to the Turnabout Dance. I
                    hope you've all had an opportunity
                    to consume the Pecan Sandies and
                    Cran-Grape that were so generously
                    donated by the Parents Club.
          
          Murmuring and applause.

                    But the real treat is yet to come.
                    It's happening right about now,
                    this treat of which I speak. We
                    have some very special guests
                    tonight. They were kind enough to
                    take a break from their sold-out
                    national tour and play our dance
                    for free.
          
          Needy gags on her juice.

          Chip continues to hurry briskly along through the park.

                    CHIP!
          CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer
          appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing
          a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.

                    Yes, I was.

                    total Lithium candidate since the
                    night Colin Gray died. But that's
                    not just because he was brutally
                    murdered and stuff. It's
                    because....I don't wanna say this.

                    Needy and Colin were intimate. By

                    Well, apparently he had a thing
                    for me-- no surprise there. And I
                    figured Needy was busy jumping
                    your jock that night, so I agreed
                    to a little pity date. Colin
                    brought me to that empty house so
                    we could have some privacy. But he
                    wanted to go too far, so I left
                    after a few minutes. Next thing I

          The heavy stage curtains part to reveal SOFT SHOULDER in

          pumping furiously.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    One thing people don't know about
                    me is that I'm fast. I just never
                    went out for track because I look
                    bad in shorts. Also, Jennifer told
                    me track was for lezzies. But I
                    am. Fast, I mean. Even in that
                    fucking afterbirth of a dress, I
                    could really tear up the asphalt.
          
          She picks up the pace, cheeks puffing.

          Jennifer is kissing Chip. She pulls him down onto the
          damp, muddy grass.

          She stands up and starts to lead Chip toward an
          abandoned, fenced-off COMMUNITY POOL. It's drained and
          spooky and looks dangerous.

                    Murphy Pool? I don't think we can

                    guys who went in there. They got
                    in big trouble and now they have
                    to pick up garbage for 100 hours.
          Jennifer giggles and pulls him along.

          Needy jogs toward CHIP's house. Exhausted and sweaty, she
          presses the doorbell. She falls to her knees on the front
          stoop, panting and wheezing.

          Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside. The fenced-in
          deck area is littered with garbage, abandoned pool
          furniture and graffiti. Someone has spray painted the
          word "HOPELESS" on a wall.
          CHIP shivers and looks around nervously.
          
          Jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out
          of it, revealing her bra and panties.

          She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to
          climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of
          filthy, freezing water.

          Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees.
          He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to
          the ladder.
          The sound of buzzing flies grows louder.
          Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm
          around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off
          the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS.

          Needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running
          toward Murphy Pool.
          
          She reaches the fence and starts climbing it. She slips
          and cuts her hand on a broken link.

          Needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an
          extraterrestrial glow. Chip's moaning is almost
          unbearable. Needy stares into the abyss and claps her
          hands over her mouth.
          
          Jennifer is waist deep in the DIRTY WATER, flinging Chip
          against the wall like a rag doll. He's still conscious,
          but his skin on his chest has been RIPPED OFF to expose
          his ribs. Jennifer is CHEWING happily.

          Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as
          Needy leaps off the diving board.
          Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She
          wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under
          the water.
          Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly-
          slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the
          PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it
          and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and

                    The cutest guy in school. The
                    mailman. A teacher. You could
                    probably even have a huge star
                    like Chad Michael Murray. So why
                    Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss
                    me off? Or is it because you're
                    insecure?
          
          Jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts
          down, landing on her feet. Needy crawls out of the pool
          and faces her down.
                                  JENNIFER
                    I am not insecure. God, what a
                    joke! How could I be insecure? I
                    was the Snowflake Queen!

          A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifer's face. She reels
          back against the chain link fence, her eyes blazing.
                                  JENNIFER
                    I'm gonna eat your soul and shit
                    it out, Lesnicki.
          Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background,
          Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an
          eight-foot handle off the pool deck.

                    I go both ways.
          She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white-
          hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous.
          Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the
          HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear.
          As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES
          HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle.
          Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence.

          Chip collapses on the pool deck.
          Jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet, "shishkebabbed"
          on the giant skimmer. With effort, she pulls the handle
          out of her body in several stages.
                                    JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Ow-Ow-Ow.
          Needy watches, and realizes Jennifer is injured. Blood
          drips onto the pool deck.

          Blood trickles out of Jennifer's wound. She tries to plug
          the hole with her hand.
          
                                    JENNIFER

          Needy shakes her head mutely.

          She smirks and jumps over the fence, stumbling off into
          the distance. Needy watches her, her eyes narrowing with
          hate.
          Once Jennifer has disappeared, Needy turns her attention
          to Chip, who is barely alive. She stares in horror at his
          torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over
          his body.

          She reaches into Chip's pocket and pulls out his beat-up
          cell phone. She wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand.
          
                                  CHIP

                    Oh yeah. You're right.
          
          Needy dials to no avail. The phone is hopelessly clogged
          with ooze. She knocks it against the deck.

          Chip begins gagging and coughing. He rolls onto his back,

          Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone.

          Illuminated by lamp light, Needy limps toward the gym
          entrance. She's completely covered in demon-goo. Her face
          is bloody, her hair is full of blood and guts, and her
          BROKEN ARM looks gruesome.
          In the background, yet another oblivious COUPLE are
          making out.
          
          Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously
          insane. They break apart and stare back at her.

          Needy bends over, casually holds one nostril closed, and
          does a "farmer blow." A bloody clot flies out of her
          nose.
          The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks, startled.

          Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her.
          People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage.
          They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their
          respective cliques.
          She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are
          playing an insufferably long coda.
          
          Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and
          sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of
          hate.
          Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk.
          
          Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at
          Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha. She looks completely
          possessed.

          Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his
          guitar. Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave
          the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym
          murmur and complain, confused.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Needy tries to follow them. She limps blindly toward the
          stage and climbs up. Everyone watches, gasping in horror.
          By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the
          gym.

                    You didn't play your hit yet.
          But they're gone.
          Needy looks out at her classmates. They stare back. She
          PASSES OUT COLD.
          
          INT. CHIP'S STREET - MORNING (TO ESTABLISH)
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    They found Chip the following
                    morning. The police couldn't find
                    an explanation for the "substance"
                    in the pool, so they chose not to
                    mention it to the press. In fact,
                    they treated the whole incident
                    like a bad dream.
          
          
          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - MORNING
          We see the POLICE (including newly minted officer ROMAN
          DUDA) informing Chip's mother that his body has been
          found. She collapses onto the floor, curling up into the
          fetal position.
                                   NEEDY
                    Trouble was, some of us would
                    never wake up.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - DAY
          Needy is lying in bed, shaking, her arm in a cast. Her
          mother tries to rouse her.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I never went back to school after
                    that. Didn't talk much either. My
                    mom bought some books so she could
                    teach me at home like crazy
                    Christians with 14 kids do. But I
                    wasn't a very cooperative student.
          
          Needy pulls the covers over her head.
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Toni shrugs, resigned, and tosses the book on the floor.
          
          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in
          the shrubbery. She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and
          a hungry expression.
          Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
          and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her
          yard.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    What nobody realized was that I
                    was doing a different kind of
                    homework. I was watching her every
                    night. Waiting.
          We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
          hair with a appraising eye.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Waiting for her to get weak and
                    dull. Waiting for her to burn
                    through the life-force she'd
                    stolen from Chip.
          
          Needy creeps away from the window.
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    It took weeks, but I finally made
                    my move. Remember?
          
          
          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          We're seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered
          Jennifer.
          Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing.
          The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of
          the police.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Even in her last moments of life,
                    she somehow managed to be cooler
                    than me.
          
          We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile
          as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. That
          signature look of mastery and control.
          
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                  NEEDY
                    She left an insanely hot corpse.
          
          We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming,
          though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC. Sure enough,
          Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually
          draped in her mother's arms. She almost seems to be
          SMIRKING at us.
          
          INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT
          We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been
          narrating the whole sordid tale. She hasn't moved a
          muscle since beginning her story. Only a single shaft of
          moonlight illuminates the room.
          
          An orderly shoves DINNER through a slot in the door. It's
          a pile of mystery meat. Needy wrinkes her nose.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I don't even know who Needy
                    Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a
                    different person now. A person who
                    uses curse words and kicks
                    orderlies and and sees things that
                    aren't there. A very bad, very
                    damaged person.
          
          Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline
          of her shirt...
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    But sometimes, change can be good.
                    For instance, most occult scholars
                    don't know this, but if you're
                    bitten by a demon--and you live--
                    you just might absorb some of the
                    demon's abilities.
          In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected-
          looking BITEMARK near her shoulder. She scratches it,
          wincing.
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    You just might get lucky for once
                    in your miserable life.
          
          PULL BACK to reveal that Needy, still cross-legged is
          HOVERING five feet off the floor. Effortlessly.
          With visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a
          narrow WINDOW positioned up near the ceiling. To anyone
          with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Needy reaches the window, gazes at it for a moment, then
          SMASHES it with surprising strength.
          
          EXT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL - FIVE MINUTES LATER
          Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers.
          She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and
          passes through it after casually mangling the bars. Only
          a Needy-shaped hole remains.
          
          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - TEN MINUTES LATER
          Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road.
          The hospital recedes in the background.
          A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching
          Needy as she walks past.
          
          A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down.
          "Through the Trees" blasts from the radio.
          Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.

          EXT. MURPHY POOL - NIGHT
          
          Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool,
          crying. It's a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip. Their faces
          are weary and sorrowful. Photos of Chip have been
          arranged around the edge of the fence. We see a picture
          of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end.
          Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing
          along, their voices soaring.
                                  VIGIL ATTENDEES

          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - CONTINUOUS
          Needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote
          country highway.

                    "...We'll meet again."
          A small creek emptying into a stream   runs parallel to the
          road. Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the
          creek and stoops to pick it up. It's   Nikolai's BOWIE
          KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be
          seen again.
          Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.
          A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks
          her thumb out again.
          The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
          a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes
          Needy lasciviously.
          
                                  OLD MAN

                       me in ass, gas or grass. Got that?
                       No free rides in this wagon.

                       Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.
          Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat.

          Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into
          her mouth.
          The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the
          distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT
          SHOULDER.
          
          We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's
          bumper.
                                   RADIO DJ
                    What a song. Thought we'd play
                    that one in honor of Soft
                    Shoulder. They're playing in
                    Madison tonight. Should be a night
                    to remember...
          The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
          horizon.

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B 
-

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

                                                      FADE OUT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

SLOW MOTION
 as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

                                                     WASH OUT TO:

HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

                            GRANT
          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

               
             GRANT
          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

                            STUDENT
          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

                            GRANT
          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

                            ELLIE
          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

            
                GRANT
          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

                            ELLIE
          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

                            GRANT
              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

                            ELLIE
          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

                            GRANT
          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

                            ELLIE
          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

                            GRANT
          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

                            ELLIE
          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

                            GRANT
          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

                            ELLIE
          We're leaving the raptor dig -

                            GRANT
          - at a critical time -

                            ELLIE
          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

                            GRANT
          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

                            GRANT
          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

                            GRANT
          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET

A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


INT  BIOGEN HQ

A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

                            MOUTH
          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

                            NEDRY
          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

                            NEDRY
          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

                            NEDRY
          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

                            NEDRY
          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

                            BAKER
          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

                            BAKER
          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

                            BAKER
          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

                            BAKER
          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

                            ROSS
          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

                            GENNARO
          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

                            ROS
S
          What does he say?

                            GENNARO
          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

                            ROSS
          You know him.  Do you believe him?

                             GENNARO
          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

                            ROSS
          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

                            GENNARO
          The firm owns five percent.

                            ROSS
          General or limited?

                            GENNARO
          General.

                            ROSS
          We should have never done that.

                            GENNARO
          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

                            ROSS
        
  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

                            ROSS
          Will they tell the truth?

                            GENNARO
          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

                            ROSS
          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

                            GENNARO
          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

                            ROSS
          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

                            ROSS
          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN

On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

                            PILOT
          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

                            ELLIE
          This is exciting!

                            GRANT
          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

                            GRANT
          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

                            PILOT
          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

                            ELLIE
          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

                            ELLIE
          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

                            GRANT
          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

                            GRANT
          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

                            GENNARO
          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

                            GRANT AND ELLIE
          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

                            ELLIE
          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

                            NEDRY
          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

                            NEDRY
          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

      
                      PILOT
          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

                            REGIS
          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING

Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

                            ED REGIS
          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

                            MULDOON
          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

                            ELLIE
          Aggressive growth, huh?

                            GRANT
          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

                            REGIS
          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

                            GRANT
          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

                            NEDRY
          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!

CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

                       
     REGIS
          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

                            REGIS
          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

                            GRANT
     
     Where's Hammond?

                            REGIS
          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

                            GENNARO
          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

                            ELLIE
          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.
overall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

                            HAMMOND
          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

                            GRANT
          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

                            HAMMOND
          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

                            GRANT
          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

                            HAMMOND
          
Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

                            HAMMOND
          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Hi, John!

                            HAMMOND
          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

                            HAMMOND
          Okay John, hold out your finger.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Why?

                            HAMMOND
          I need some of your
 genetic material.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          Now just a minute here, John.

                            HAMMOND
          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

                            2ND HAMMOND
          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

                            HAMMOND
          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

                            NEW HAMMOND'S
          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

                            HAMMOND
          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

                            HAMMOND
          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

                            REGIS
          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

                            HAMMOND
          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

                            GRANT
          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

                            GRANT
          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

                            HAMMOND
          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

                            ELLIE
          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY

Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

                            LEX
          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

                            GENNARO
              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

                            HAMMOND
          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

                            GRANT
          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

                            LEX
          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

                            ELLIE
          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

                            HAMMOND
          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

                            HAMMOND
          Jurassic Park is the most advanced
          amusement park in the world.  We work
          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

                            GRANT
          What exactly do you mean ... biological
          attractions?

                            HAMMOND
          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,
          mysterious extinction created a time
          barrier unscalable until ... now.

BEAT.

                            GRANT
          Yes?

                            HAMMOND
          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

                            HAMMOND
          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that
          every child in the whole wide world will
          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

                            GENNARO
          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

                            HAMMOND
          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in
          the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above
          the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex!
          238 fabulous creatures so far!

                            TIMMY
          Real dinosaurs, Grandpa?  Don't they want
          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

                            HAMMOND
          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

                            ELLIE
          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

                            HAMMOND
          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

                            GRANT
          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

                            HAMMOND
          Yes ... there is.


INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

                            HAMMOND
          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

                            HAMMOND
          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

                            HAMMOND
          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

                            ELLIE
              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

                     
       HAMMOND
          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

                            NEDRY
          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

                            ARNOLD
          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

                            NEDRY
          Right.


BACK ON HALLWAY -

Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

                            TIMMY
          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

                  
          HAMMOND
          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION

Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

                            LEX
          It's ... gold!

                            TIMMY
          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

                            LEX
          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

                            HAMMOND
          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

                            GRANT
          Like mosquitos -

                            HAMMOND
          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
        
  material?  My God!  It just might work.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY

A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

                            HAMMOND
          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

                            GRANT
          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

                            LEX
          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

                            ELLIE
          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

                            HAMMOND
          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

                            GRANT
          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

                 
           HAMMOND
          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


INT  GENETICS ROOM

A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

                            HAMMOND
          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

                            WU
          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

                            WU
          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

                            HAMMOND
          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

                            WU
          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

                            WU
          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY

A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

                            GRANT
          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

                            WU
          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

                            HAMMOND
          Our primordial soup.

                            GRANT
          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

                            WU
          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

                            GENNARO
          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

                            LEX
          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

                            WU
          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

                            WU
          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

                            LEX
          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

                            WU
          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

                            GRANT
          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

                   
         WU
          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

                            GRANT
          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

                            WU
          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

                            WU
          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

                            HAMMOND
          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY

Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

                            GENNARO
          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

                            ELLIE
          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

                            GENNARO
          How do you mean?

                            ELLIE
          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

                            GRANT
          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


EXT  TOUR START - DAY

The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

                            REGIS
          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

                            GENNARO
          Looks like rain to me.

         
                   REGIS
          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

                            HAMMOND
          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

                            HAMMOND
          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

                            GRANT
          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now
          entering the lost world of the
          prehistoric past, a world of mighty
          creatures long gone from the face of the
          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)
          That's Richard Kiley.  We spared no
          expense.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          We'll begin our tour today with the
          herbivores ...


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY

Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

                            REGIS
          Look ...

                            LEX AND TIMMY
          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

                            REGIS
          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

                            GRANT
          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

                            REGIS
          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

                            ELLIE
          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

                            GENNARO
          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

                            HAMMOND
          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

                            ARNOLD
          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh, balls.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY

The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

                            GRANT
          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

                            ELLIE
          What to you mean?

                            GRANT
          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

                            ALL THREE
          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

                            GENNARO
          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

                            GRANT
              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

                            ELLIE
          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

                            ELLIE
          Are we dreaming all this?


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY

A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

               
             MULDOON
          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

                            HAMMOND
          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

                            MULDOON
          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

                            MULDOON
          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
         
 We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

                            HAMMOND
          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

                            MULDOON
          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

                            HAMMOND
          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

                            ARNOLD
          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

                            HAMMOND
          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

                            RADIO
 
         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

                            RADIO
          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

                            NEDRY
          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

                            HAMMOND
          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

                 
           RADIO
          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

                            LEX
          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

                            VET
          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

                            REGIS
          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

                            GRANT
          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

                            ELLIE
          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

                            LEX
          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

                            HARDING
          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

                            ELLIE
          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

                            HARDING
          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

                            ELLIE
          West Indian Lilacs!

                            GRANT
          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

                            HARDING
          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

                            GRANT
          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

                            ELLIE
          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

                            HARDING
          I don't get it.

                            GRANT
          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

                            ELLIE
          So, she poisons herself periodically.

                            HARDING
          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

                            GRANT
          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

                            LEX
          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

                            GENNARO
          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

                            ELLIE
          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

                            GRANT
          Soil samples?

                            ELLIE
          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

        
                    GRANT
          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK

The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

                            TOUR
          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
          Where is the T-
Rex?

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

                            GRANT
          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

                            GRANT
          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


BACK ON CONTRO
L ROOM -

Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

                            MULDOON
          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

                            HAMMOND
          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

                            MULDOON
          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -

Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

                            LEX
          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

                            GRANT
          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

                            REGIS
          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

                            RECORDED VOICE
          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

                            LEX
          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

                            GENNARO (MONITOR
ED)
          What is a carnivore got out?

                            GRANT (MONITORED)
          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

                            HAMMOND
          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

                            ARNOLD
          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

                            HAMMOND
          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

                            ARNOLD
          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

                            HAMMOND
          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

                            ARNOLD
          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

                            HAMMOND
          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

                            NEDRY
          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

                            NEDRY
          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

CLOSE ON 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT

The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

                            LEX
          Hey, is that bathroom working?

                            REGIS
          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

                            GRANT
          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

                            REGIS
          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Nedry yawns loudly.

                            NEDRY
          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

                            HAMMOND
          Slob!

                            ARNOLD
          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT

Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

                            REGIS
          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

                            GENNARO
          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

                            REGIS
          No, darling, of course not.

                            LEX
          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

                            REGIS
          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

                            NEDRY
          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

                            HAMMOND
          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

                            HAMMOND
          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

                            ARNOLD
          That's not the worst of it.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

                            WU
          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

                            HAMMOND
          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

                            MULDOON
          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

     
                       HAMMOND
          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


INT  GARAGE - NIGHT

Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

                            NEDRY
          Oh, shit!


INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -

Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT

Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


BACK ON GARAGE

Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

                            MULDOON
          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

                            ELLIE
          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


EXT  DOCK - NIGHT

Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

                            NEDRY
          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
       
   nobody could land on the water.

                            NEDRY
              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

                            NEDRY
              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

                            NEDRY
          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

                            NEDRY
          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

                            NEDRY
          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

                            TIMMY
          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

                            TIMMY
          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

                            REGIS
          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

                            TIMMY
          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

                            LEX
          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX
          They have one of those things from the
          room with all the eggs - you know, where
          they help the baby eggs grow up.

                            TIMMY
          You mean an incubator?

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          What's the commotion?

                            REGIS
          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.

                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

                            TIMMY
          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

                            LEX (TO WALKIE)
          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

                            GRANT
          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

                            GENNARO
          When's the damn power coming on?


INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS

Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

                            MULDOON
          Strong legs.

                            ELLIE
          Lot of track in college.


BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

 
                           LEX
          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?

                            REGIS
          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

                            REGIS
          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

                            LEX
          Feels like a vibration.


INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


BACK ON CRUISE
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER

There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


CLOSE ON LEX -

Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

                            REGIS
          Jesus Christ.

                            LEX
          Bad language.

     
                       REGIS
          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't
          electrified.

                            LEX
          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

                            TIM
          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

                            LEX
          He just left us.  He just left us all
          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


IN THE SECOND CRUISER -

GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


TIMMY REACHES -

out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


BACK ON GRANT -

He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

                            GENNARO
          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

                            GRANT
        
  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


BACK ON TIM -

He watches the beast move.


BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -

As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

                            GRANT
          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


IN THE FIRST CRUISER -

Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

                            LEX
          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -

The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


ON TIM -

He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

                            LEX
          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


GRANT -

watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


TIMMY AND LEX -

have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

                            TIMMY
          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

                            TIMMY
              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



GRANT DANCES -

with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

                            GENNARO
          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


GRANT RUNS BA
CK -

to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

                            LEX (OFF)
          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

                            GRANT
          Lex, are you okay?

                            LEX
          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

                            LEX
          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

                            GRANT
          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
FLASHES.


EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -

Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

                            NEDRY
          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

                            NEDRY
          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
- HOOT!

Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

                            NEDRY
          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

                            NEDRY
          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER

Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION

Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

                            TIMMY
          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          Timmy.  Are you ok?

                            TIMMY
          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

                            GRANT
          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

                            GRANT
          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

                            GRANT
          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

                            GRANT
          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

                            TIMMY
          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

                            GRANT
          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

                            TIMMY
          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


INT  DRAINPIPE -

Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

ON THE HILLSIDE -

Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

                            GRANT
          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

                            TIMMY
          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

                            TIMMY
          I found your baseball.

                            LEX
          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

                            GRANT
          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

                            LEX
          I'm afraid of the "animals".

                            TIMMY
          The "animals" are gone.

                            LEX
          Where did it go?

                            TIMMY
          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

                            LEX
          Are there any grownups out there?

                            GRANT
          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

                            LEX
          I'm hungry.

                            GRANT
          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


EXT  ROADSIDE

Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

                            REGIS
          Noooooo!


BACK ON HILLSIDE -

Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

                            GRANT
          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

                            REGIS
    
      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -

Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

                            ELLIE
          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

                            MULDOON
          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

                            MULDOON
          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

                            MULDOON
          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

                            ELLIE
          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

                            MULDOON
          Perhaps.

                            ELLIE
          No!  They're out there.

                            MULDOON
          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

                            MULDOON
          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

                            MULDOON
          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

                            ELLIE
          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

                            MULDOON
          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

                            ELLIE
          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

                            WU
          Why?

                            ARNOLD
          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

              
              WU
          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

                            ARNOLD
          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

                            WU
          What's that?

                            ARNOLD
          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
PERIM
ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

                            WU
          What's it mean?

                            ARNOLD
          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

                            WU
          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

                            MULDOON
          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
    
      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure you'll find them.

                            MULDOON
          I certainly hope so.

                            HAMMOND
          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

                            MULDOON
          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

                            HAMMOND
          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

                            GENNARO
          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

                            HARDING
          He's had a lot of morphine.

                            GENNARO
              (sings)
          Not enough.

                            ELLIE
          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

                            HARDING
          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

                            GENNARO
          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT

The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:


INT  STATEROOM -

The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


EXT  PARK - NIGHT

Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

                            LEX
          I'm tired.

                            TIMMY
          You're too big to be carried.

                            LEX
          But I'm tired-tired.

                            GRANT
          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

                            GRANT
          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

                            GRANT
          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

                            GRANT
          What?

                            LEX
          The fence.

                            GRANT
              (squinting)
          No.

                            TIMMY
          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

                            LEX
          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

                            TIMMY
          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

                   
         GRANT
          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

                            LEX
              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

                            GRANT
          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

                             TIM
          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

                            GRANT
          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

                            TIM
          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

                            GRANT
          Up there.

                            TIM
          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

                            GRANT
          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE

Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

                            TIMMY
              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

                            WU
          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

                            ELLIE
          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

                            WU
          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many
          viruses 
in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

                            ELLIE
          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

                            WU
          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

                            MULDOON
          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

                            ARNOLD
          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

                            MULDOON
          That's what?

                            ARNOL
D
          I found the command to restore the
          original code.  It resets the linked
          parameters.

                            MULDOON
          The fences and the power?

                            ARNOLD
          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

                            MULDOON
          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

                            ARNOLD
          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

                            ARNOLD
          Hot damn!

                            MULDOON
          Are the fences back on?

                            ARNOLD
          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

                            MULDOON
          Motion sensors?

                            ARNOLD
          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          Just hiss.


BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -

Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

                            MULDOON
          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

                            ARNOLD
          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

                            ARNOLD
          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

                            MULDOON
          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide
.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT

Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

                            WU
          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

                            WU
          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as
the sky lightens.  The Anne B is a small dot on the massive ocean.


INT  STATEROOM, ANNE B

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

                                                      CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING AERIAL - the primordial beauty of Isla Nublar at dawn.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN

Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN

CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

                            LEX
          He gonna eat us?

                            GRANT
          I don't think so.  She's a ...

                            GRANT AND TIMMY
          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!

The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

                            LEX
          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

                            GRANT
          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

                            MULDOON
          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

                            MULDOON
          Let's see what's up.


EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING

Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

                            GRANT
          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

                            TIM
          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

           
                 LEX
          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

                            LEX
          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

                            TIM
          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

                            LEX
          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

                            LEX
          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

                            LEX
          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

                 
           GRANT
          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

                            LEX
          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

                            GRANT
          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

                            LEX
          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

                            GRANT
          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING

Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

                            MULDOON
          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

                            BEARDED WORKE
R (OFF)
          I found him!

                            BALD WORKER (OFF)
          Found him!


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY

Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

                            HAMMOND
          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

                            HAMMOND
          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
    
      as we speak.

                            GENNARO
          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

                            HAMMOND
          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

                            HAMMOND
          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

                            HAMMOND
          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

                            HAMMOND
          Wu says he can make a foot high
    
      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living
          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

                            HARDING
          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
          He's doped to infinity and back.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

                            WU
          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

                            ELLIE
          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

                            WU
          That's absurd.

                            ELLIE
          These bones aren't fully formed.

                            WU
          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

                            Y
          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

                            WU
          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

                            ELLIE
          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

                            HAMMOND (OFF)
          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

                            WU
          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

                            HAMMOND
          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

                            WU
          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

                            HAMMOND
          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

                            HAMMOND
          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY


Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


INT CONTROL - DAY

Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

                            ELLIE
          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

                            ARNOLD
          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

                            ELLIE
          Find what?

                            ARNOLD
          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

                            WU
          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

                            ARNOLD
          Shut the system down?

                            WU
          And reset.

                            ARNOLD
          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

                            ELLIE
          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

                            ELLIE
          Well?

                            ARNOLD
          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

                            ELLIE
          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

                            ARNOLD
          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

                            ELLIE
          How long do we have to wait?

                            ARNOLD
          Thirty seconds.


EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -

Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

                            GRANT
          What is it?

                            LEX
          I hear something.

                            GRANT
          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

                            LEX
          Hear it now?

                            TIMMY
          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

                            TIMMY
          What's going on?

                            GRANT
          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

                            LEX
          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

                            GRANT
          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

                            ARNOLD
          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

                            ARNOLD
          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

                            ELLIE
          What's wrong?

                            ARNOLD
          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

                            ARNOLD
          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold!  They're still not working.

                            ARNOLD
          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

                            WU
              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

                            ARNOLD
          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

                            ELLIE
          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be -

                    
        HAMMOND
          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

                            ELLIE
          What's happening?

                            ARNOLD
              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

                            WU
          My good God.

                            ELLIE
          What?

                            ARNOLD
          It's the Rex ...

                            HAMMOND
          They've stampeded ...


BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -

Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

CLOSE ON
 - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

                            TIMMY
          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

                            HAMMOND
          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

                            HAMMOND
          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

                            HAMMOND
          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

                            MUL
DOON
          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY

The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

                            GRANT
          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

                            LEX
          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

                            TIMMY
          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

                            LEX
          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

                            GRANT
          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

                            LEX
          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

                            GRANT
          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

                            LEX

          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

                            GRANT
          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

                            TIMMY
          Let's do it.


INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -

Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

                            GRANT
          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

                            TIMMY
          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

                            GRANT
          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

                            LEX
          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

                            GRANT
          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

                            LEX
          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

                            GRANT
          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

                            TIMMY
          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

                            TIMM
Y
          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

                            GRANT
          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -

Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

                            GRANT
          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -

Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

                            LEX
          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

                            GRANT
          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

                            LEX
          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

                            GRANT
          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

                            LEX
          You can't sleep.

                            GRANT
              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

                            LEX
          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

                            TIMMY
          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


A BEND IN THE RIVER -

Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

                            TIMMY
          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


ANOTHER BEND -

Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

                            TIMMY
          Thought
 is looked calm?

                            GRANT
          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

                            LEX
          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

                            GRANT
          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

                            TIMMY
          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

                            TIMMY
          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

               
             TIMMY
          You can do it!

                            GRANT
          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

                            GRANT
          No!!!!!

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

                            MULDOON
          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

                            HAMMOND
          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

                            MULDOON
          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

                            WU
          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

                            ELLIE
          You running on auxiliary power?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm not.

                            WU
          Looks like you are.

                            ARNOLD
          Can't be.

                            WU
          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

                            HAMMOND
          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

                            HAMMOND
          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

                            HAMMOND
          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

                            ARNOLD
          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -

Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

                            LEX
          The waterfall stopped.

                            TIMMY
          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

                            GRANT
          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

                            GRANT
          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


BACK ON CON
TROL ROOM -

Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

                            HAMMOND
          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

                            WU
          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

                            ARNOLD
          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

                            WU
          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER

                            MULDOON
          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

                            ARNOLD
          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

                            MULDOON
          All of the fences?

                            ARNOLD
          Yes.

                            MULDOON
          Including the velociraptor mesh?

                            ARNOLD
              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

                            HAMMOND
          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

                            ARNOLD
          I'm afraid so.

                            MULDOON
          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

                            HAMMOND
          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON

Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

                            ARNOLD
          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

           
                 MULDOON
          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

                            MULDOON
          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON

Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON

Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

                            MULDOON
          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

                            ELLIE
          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

                            MULDOON
          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

                            HAMMOND
          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

                            ELLIE
          Wait.  What about Arnold?


EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -

Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

                            TIMMY
          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON

Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

                            GRANT
          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

                            TIM
          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
   
       one.


EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

                            MULDOON
          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

                            MULDOON
          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

                            ELLIE
          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

                            MULDOON
          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

                            WU
          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

                            ELLIE
          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE

The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


INT  GE
NERATOR BUILDING -

Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

                            ELLIE
          Damn, I banged my head.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

                            WU (OVER RADIO)
          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

                            ELLIE
          One -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Two -


BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -

Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


BACK ON ELLIE -

                            ELLIE
          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


BACK ON LEX -

She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!

The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

                            LEX
          We did it!

                            TIM
          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


BACK ON ELLIE -

The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

                            ELLIE
          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

                            WU
          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

                            ELLIE
          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

                            ELLIE
          They're coming inside!

                            WU
          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

                            MULDOON
          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION

Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

                            MULDOON
          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

                            ELLIE
          Why didn't the power go on?

                            MULDOON
          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -

Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

                            LEX
          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

                            GRANT
          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

                            GRANT
          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

                            LEX
          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

                            GRANT
          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

                 
           TIMMY
          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

                            GRANT
          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

                            LEX
          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

                            TIMMY
          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

                            GRANT
          Be right back.


INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

                            ELLIE
          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

                            MULDOON
          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY

The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


INT  STATEROOM -

The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

                                                      CUT TO:

CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

                            LEX
          Any candy behind the counter?

                            TIMMY
          Hungry?

                            LEX
          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

                            TIMMY
          Nothing.

                            LEX
          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

                            TIMMY
          Dr. Grant said -

                            LEX
          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

                            TIMMY
          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

                            TIMMY
          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

                            LEX
          Where are we going?

                            TIM
          The kitchen!


INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

                            ELLIE
          How long?

                            MULDOON
          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

                            ELLIE
          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

                            GRANT
          Ellie, I'm go glad -

                            ELLIE
          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION

The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

                            TIMMY
          We'll freeze to death in there.

                            LEX
          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

                            TIMMY
          PUSH!

The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

                            LEX
          What is it, Timmy?

                            TIMMY
          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


INT  GIFT SHOP -

Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -

The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


INT  GENETICS ROOM -

The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -

The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

                            GRANT
          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

                            TIMMY
          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

                            GRANT
          Ok good, you're elected.


INT  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te
ll Timmy how to reboot?

                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

                            GRANT
          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

                            LEX
          Are they going to be ok?

                            GRANT
          If we can get help very soon.

                            TIMMY
          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
PLEASE TRY AGAIN.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
SYSTEMS NORMAL.


BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -

The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          Ok, we're all right here for now.
      
    Thanks.

                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.

                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

                            TIM
          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

                            GRANT
          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

                            RADIO
          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

                            GRANT
          Report your position!

                            RADIO
          Ah, we're just about to dock here in
          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please
          identify yourself.

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F
REDERICK D. (CAPT.)
Grant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.

                            GRANT
          Try this for identification, Captain
          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen
          biological materials.  If you don't turn
          that boat around and return to Isla
          Nublar immediately with your contraband
          cargo, you will be found in violation of
          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,
          you will be subject to revocation of
          license, penalties in excess of fifty
          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.
          Do you copy?

SILENCE.

                            GRANT
          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?

                            RADIO
          I copy.  All ahead stern.

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

                            TIMMY
          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

                     
       GRANT
          Who the hell knows?

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

                            LEX
          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

                            GRANT
          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


INT ROTUNDA -

With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

                            GRANT
              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK

Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

              
              HAMMOND
          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful
          place.  I need a man just like you to
          help me get my park back on its feet
          again.  And it will be on its feet again.

                            GRANT
          We have to leave now.

Hammond stops.

                            HAMMOND
          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

                            HAMMOND
          Don't you see I've exalted human
          potential here?  You must see it.  You
          must feel it.  I called back a life form.
          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just
          that - let the others go, if they want.

                            GRANT
          You interrupted natural law.  There are
          regulations,
 rules that nature follows
          that make her knowable.

                            HAMMOND
          You mean there are rules that nature
          follows that create barriers to our
          knowledge.

                            GRANT
          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth
          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

                            HAMMOND
          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

                            GRANT
          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

                            GRANT
          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

                            HAMMOND
          I created genetic miracles!

                            GRANT
          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

                            HAMMOND
          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

                            GRANT
          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
          
                            HAMMOND
          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

                            GRANT
          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


IN THE COPTER -

SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

                            ELLIE
          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

                            GRANT
          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

                            ELLIE
          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

                            GRANT
   
       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

                            ELLIE
          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR

Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:


EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT

The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

                                                      FADE OUT.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK

 
			THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Screenplay by
			  David Koepp
	
		     based on the novel by
			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to
			 Hammond's)
		These pictures were taken in a
		hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight
		hours ago, after an American family
		on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site
		B.  The little girl will be fine, but
		her parents are wealthy, angry, and
		very fond of lawsuits.  But that's
		hardly new to us, is it?
			(takes a paper from the
			 file)
		Wrongful death settlements, partial
		list:  family of Donald Gennaro, 36.5
		million dollars; family of Robert
		Muldoon, 12.6 million.  Damaged or
		destroyed equipment, 17.3 million.
		Demolition, de-construction, and
		disposal of Isla Nublar facilities,
		organic and inorganic, one hundred
		and twenty-six million dollars.  The
		list goes on, gentlemen -- research
		funding, media payoffs.  Silence is
		expensive.

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		When?

							CUT TO:

	INT. MOBILE FIELD SYSTEMS - DAY

	Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the
	end of a bench.  Two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and
	MALCOLM is lifting them, painfully rehabbing his injury while
	talking on a satellite phone.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five
		member team.

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM
		Eddie Carr's handling all our
		equipment and he'll be there to
		maintain it.  He's designing special
		field trailers now, top of the line
		mobile research units.

	EDDIE CARR, fortyish, is barking out orders to the Workmen.

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't
		deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test
		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,
		sure, why not, it's only impossible.
		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

				EDDIE
		Former academic.  Now I actually make
		things.  I don't just talk.

				MALCOLM
		You think I'm all talk, Eddie?

				EDDIE
			(doesn't look at him)
		It doesn't matter what I think.

				MALCOLM
		Is there anything we've forgotten?
		Anything at all?

	Behind them, someone CLEARS THEIR THROAT.  Eddie and Malcolm
	turn around.  KELLY MALCOLM, an African-American girl around
	twelve years old, stands in the doorway to the garage, a
	duffel bag slung over one shoulder.  She looks at Malcolm and
	breaks into a wide grin.

				KELLY
		Hi, Dad.

				MALCOLM
		Kelly!  What are you doing here?

	She drops the bag on the floor, and wraps her arms around him
	in a warm embrace.  He responds stiffly.

				KELLY
		Vacation.  I'm all yours.  You didn't
		forget, did you?

	She pulls back and looks at him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
		Did you?

							CUT TO:

	INT. EDDIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	KELLY is slumped in a chair in Eddie's office next to the
	construction floor.  Outside the glass windows work on the
	vehicles continues unabated.  MALCOLM hangs up the phone.

				MALCOLM
		Okay, Karen is expecting you in half
		an hour.  You only have to stay with
		her one night, she'll put you on a
		bus in the morning and your mother
		will be at the station when you get
		there.

				KELLY
		I don't even know this woman.

				MALCOLM
		Well, I do, and she's fantastic.
		She'll take you to the museum, maybe
		to a movie if you play your cards
		right.  You're going to have a
		fantastic time.

				KELLY
		Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you
		going?

				MALCOLM
		I can't tell you.  But I'll be back
		within a week.

				KELLY
		My vacation is over in a week.

				MALCOLM
		I'll make it up to you this summer.
		I promise.

				KELLY
		I'm your daughter all the time, you
		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

 FADE OUT
THE LOST WORLD
			 JURASSIC PARK

			Screenplay by
			  David Koepp
	
		     based on the novel by
			Michael Crichton

	EXT. TROPICAL LAGOON - DAY

	A 135-foot-luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a 
	tropical lagoon.  The beach is a stunning crescent of white
	sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.

				ISLA SORNA
		87 miles southeast of Nublar

	Two SHIP HANDS, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a
	picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully
	laying out luncheon service -- fine china, silver, crystal
	decanters with red and white wine.

	PAUL BOWMAN, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side,
	reading.  MRS. BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually
	surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than
	once, supervises the settings of the table.

	She looks up and sees a little girl, CATHY, seven or eight
	years old, wandering off down the beach.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy!  Don't wander off!

	Cathy keeps wandering.

				MRS. BOWMAN (cont'd)
		Cathy, come back!  You can look for
		shells right here!

	Cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.

				BOWMAN
			(eyes still in his book)
		Leave her alone.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		What about snakes?

				BOWMAN
		There's no snakes on a beach.  Let
		her have fun, for once.

	FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH,

	Cathy keeps wandering away, MUTTERING to herself as her
	parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.

				CATHY
		Please be quiet, please be quiet
		please be quiet...

	Rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view
	behind her.  A RUSTLING sound draws her attention, and she
	turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the
	sand.

	A large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches
	swaying and shaking.  Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush,
	which abruptly stops moving.

	A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes
	along its back, steps out from the bush.  Only about a foot
	tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail.
	It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.

				CATHY
		Well, hello there!

	The animal (a COMPSOGNATHUS) just stares at her.  Cathy squats
	down on her haunches.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		What are you?  A little bird or
		something?

	She opens her hand.  She's got a handful of goldfish crackers.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Are you hungry?  You want a goldfish?

	The compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Come on.  I won't hurt you.

	The compy draws closer.  Cathy holds the cracker in the palm
	of her hand.  The compy gets closer still --

	-- and hops numbly up onto Cathy's palm.  Her arm dips a bit
	under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up
	easily.  It bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats
	it.

	Enchanted, Cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her
	hand, calling back over her shoulder.

				CATHY (cont'd)
		Mom!  Dad!  You gotta come see this!
		I found something!

	She turns back.

	Thirty more compys have come out onto the sand.  They're
	standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few
	feet away.  Cathy's smile fades.

	She turns her head slowly to the right.  TWENTY MORE COMPYS
	have come in from that side, forming a semi-circle, bobbing
	and CHIPPING as they surround her.

				CATHY (cont'd)
			(terrified)
		What do you guys want?

	BACK ON THE BEACH,

	the table is set.  Mrs. Bowman calls out.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		Cathy, sweetheart!  Lunch is ready!

	From around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts
	from the jungle trees as Cathy's shrill SCREAMS suddenly
	pierce the air.

				MRS. BOWMAN
		PAUL!

	She takes off, running down the beach, Mr. Bowman leaps out of
	his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off
	to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them.

	DOWN THE BEACH,

	Mrs. Bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend
	in the beach.  We don't see what she sees, but we hear the
	frenzied SQUEAKING of the strange compys.  Mr. Bowman and the
	Hands race past her to help Cathy as Mrs. Bowman lets loose a
	horrified, slack-jawed SCREAM, her mouth a perfect oval.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

	Mrs. Bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the
	YAWNING face of a bored CORPORATE EXECUTIVE, TWENTY OTHER
	EXECUTIVES sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a
	monied corporation.  All are in expensive suits, most are over
	sixty.  There are rows of BACKBENCHERS too, whispering in their
	lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their
	ears.  Empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table
	hint that everyone's been here a long time.

	A familiar VOICE resounds through the boardroom as we move
	down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		The hurricane seemed like a disaster
		at the time, but now I think it was a
		blessing, nature's way of freeing
		those animals from their human
		confines.  Of giving them another
		chance to survive, but this time as
		they were meant to, without man's
		interference.

	The source of the voice is JOHN HAMMOND, the founder of InGen
	and creator of Jurassic Park.  But he's not in the room.  His
	image is on a closed circuit TV screen, which has been wheeled
	up to the end of the table.

	And he doesn't look good.  He's terribly infirmed, propped up
	in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment BEEPING
	around him.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		There are some corporate issues that
		are not about the bottom line.  We
		have so much still to learn about
		those creatures.  A whole world of
		intricate, interlocking behaviors,
		vanished everywhere -- except for
		Site B. Please.  Let's not do what
		is good for more men at the expense
		at what is best for all mankind.

	The CHAIRMAN, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.

				CHAIRMAN
		Thank you, John.  Mr. Ludlow?

	He turns to PETER LUDLOW, late thirties, a man with the
	anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk.
	Ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white
	eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.

				LUDLOW
			(an accent similar to

	He's warming up.  Not a bad performer.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This corporation has been bleeding
		from the throat for four years.  You,
		our board of directors, have set
		patiently and listened to ecology
		lectures while Mr. Hammond signed
		your checks and spent your money.
		You have watched your stock drop from
		seventy-eight and a quarter to
		nineteen flat with no good and in
		sight.  And all along, we have held a
		significant product asset that we
		could have safely harvested and
		displayed for profit.  Enormous
		profit.

	He reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove,
	sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of
	them.  It's a mini-mall version of a zoo.  Cages hold tiny
	replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while Boy Scout troops
	and Tourists look on in wonder.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Enough money to wipe out four years
		of lawsuits and damage control and
		unpleasant infighting, enough to not
		only send our stock back to where it
		was but to double it.  And the one
		thing, the only thing standing
		between us and this asset is a
		born-again naturalist who happens to
		be our own CEO.  Well, I don't work
		for Mother Nature.  I work for you.

	Two of his Backbenchers distribute documents from a stack.
	Ludlow takes one and reads from it.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		"Whereas the Chief Executive
		Officer has engaged in wasteful and
		negligent business practices to
		further his own personal
		environmental beliefs --
		Whereas these practices have 
		affected the financial performance
		of the company by incurring
		significant losses --
		Whereas the shareholders have been
		materially harmed by these losses --
		Thereby, be it resolved that John
		Parker Hammond should be resolved from
		the office of Chief Executive
		Officer, affective immediately."  Mr.
		Chairman, I move the resolution be
		put to an immediate vote.  Do I have
		a second?

				BOARD MEMBER
		I second the motion,  Mr. Chairman,
		Please poll the members by a show of
		hands.

	The CHAIRMAN signs heavily, feeling like a traitor.  He can't
	bear to look at Hammond on the TV monitor.

				CHAIRMAN
		All those in favor of InGen Corporate
		Resolution 213C, please signify your
		approval by raising your right hand.

	It starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes
	up.  Ludlow sits back, victorious.  Hammond, furious, raises
	his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at
	the TV screen.  It goes blank.

	EXT. WELDER'S YARD - NIGHT

	Sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle
	of a welder's yard.  Scrap iron and steel lies everywhere.
	Somewhere inside the shed, a phone RINGS.

	The WHOOSH of the arc welder shuts off.  DIETER STARK, a big
	barrel-chested man of forty or so, his face streaked with soot
	and grime, steps outside with a cordless phone, a cigarette
	dangling from his lips.

				DIETER
		Yeah.

	He takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end.  He
	smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke.

							CUT TO:
	INT. NEW YORK SUBWAY - NIGHT

	Smoke turns into steam as a subway THUNDER into a station
	underneath Manhattan.  The door WHOOSH open, spit out some
	COMMUTERS and suck up a few more.

	A tall man hurries down the platform, limping heavily, moving
	as fast as he can.  The subway doors begin to close, but just
	before they meet --

	-- the man jams a cane in between, stopping them.  The man
	is IAN MALCOLM, fortyish, dressed in black from head to toe.
	There's a hard wisdom in Malcolm's eyes that may not have been
	there's a few years ago -- he know what you think, and he
	doesn't care.

	INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

	MALCOLM finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down.
	He looks awful.  Tired.  Weathered.  He notices a CURIOUS MAN
	across from his is staring at his.  Malcolm looks away.  The
	Curious Man still stares.  Nervy, the Curious Man gets up and
	approaches.

				MALCOLM
			(under his breath)
		Shit.

	The Curious Man sits down next to Malcolm, grinning.

				MAN
		You're him, aren't you?

				MALCOLM
		Excuse me?

				MAN
		The guy.  The scientist.  I saw you
		on TV.
			(conspiratorially)
		I believed you.

	No response from Malcolm.  The guy leans in even closer.

				MAN (cont'd)
		Roooooarr.

				MALCOLM
			(a withering look)
		I was misquoted.  I was merely
		speculating on the evolutionary
		scenario of a Lost World.  I never
		said I was in any such place.

	He gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the
	Curious Man.  As he sits down, he notices two other COMMUTERS
	across from him are staring at him.

	He looks at them.  They looks away.

	He pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him.  Nowhere
	to hide.

	INT. JOHN HAMMOND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A UNIFORMED BUTLER has a question:

				BUTLER
		Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is
		calling?

	MALCOLM stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated Park
	Avenue apartment.

				MALCOLM
		Ian Malcolm

	A door opens and a little dog comes YAPPING out of the back.
	It bounds straight at Malcolm, GROWLING, jaws SNAPPING.  It
	lunges --

	-- and Malcolm BATS it away with one swift swing of his cane.
	The dog rolls across the floor and slinks away, WHINING.  The
	Butler looks at Malcolm disapprovingly.
	
				BUTLER
		Not an animal lover?

				MALCOLM
		Not really.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MALCOLM enters a darkened bedroom.  JOHN HAMMOND lies in the
	bed we saw earlier, on the other side of the room;

	Medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among
	the furniture and flowers, but the sheer abundance of it tells
	us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle.

				HAMMOND
		Ian!  Don't linger in the doorway
		like an ingenue, come in, come in!

	Malcolm steps further into the room.

				HAMMOND (cont'd)
		It's good to see you.  It really is.
		How's the leg?

				MALCOLM
		Resentful.

				HAMMOND
		When you have a lot of time to think,
		it's funny who you remember.  It's
		the people who challenged you.  It is
		the quality of our opponents that
		gives our accomplishments meaning.  I
		never told you how sorry I was about
		what happened after we returned.
	
	Noticing Hammond's deteriorated condition, Malcolm finds it
	hard to sustain anger.
	
				MALCOLM
		I didn't know you -- weren't well.
		
				HAMMOND
		It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are
		finally killing me.
		
				MALCOLM
		They do have motives.  Why did you
		want to see me?  Your message said it
		was urgent.
		
				HAMMOND
		You were right -- and I was wrong.
		There!  Did you ever think you'd hear
		me say that?  Spectacularly wrong.
		Instead of observing those animals, I
		tried to control them.  I squandered
		an opportunity and we still know next
		to nothing about their lives.  Not
		their lives as man would have them,
		behind electric fences, but in the
		wild.  Behavior in their natural
		habitat, the impossible dream of any
		paleontologist.  I could have had it,
		but I let it slip away.
			(pause)
		Thank God for Site B.
		
	Malcolm just looks at him for a long moment.
	
				MALCOLM
		What?
		
				HAMMOND
			(a spark in his eye)
		Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle
		compact to you?
		
				MALCOLM
		What are you talking about?
	
				HAMMOND
		The hatchery, in particular?  You
		know my initial yields had to be low,
		far less than one percent, that's a
		thousand embryos for every single
		live birth.  Genetic engineering on
		that scale implies a giant operation,
		not the spotless little laboratory I
		showed you.

				MALCOLM
		I don't believe you.

				HAMMOND
		Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian,
		something for the tourists, Site B
		was the factory floor.  We built it
		first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some
		miles from Nublar.

				MALCOLM
		No, no, no, no, no, no . . .

				HAMMOND
		After the accident at the park, a
		hurricane wiped out our facility on
		Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave
		the animals to fend for themselves.
		And they did.  For four years I've
		fought to keep them safe from human
		meddling, now I want you to go there
		and document them.

				MALCOLM
		Are you out of your mind?  I still
		have nightmares, my reputation's a
		joke, my leg is shot -- you think I
		need more of that?

				HAMMOND
		It would be the most extraordinary
		living fossil record the world has
		ever seen.

				MALCOLM
		So what?

	Hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near
	to him and open it on his lap.  Inside, there are memos,
	charts, maps and photographs.

				HAMMOND
		I've been putting this together for
		over a year.
			(MORE)
		I have personal suggestions for your
		entire team, phone numbers, contact
		people.  They won't believe you about
		what they're going to see, so don't
		bother trying to convince them.  Just
		use my checkbook to get them there.
		I'll fund your expedition through my
		personal accounts, as such money and
		equipment as you need, but only if
		you leave immediately.  If we
		hesitate, all will be lost.

				MALCOLM
		John . . .

				HAMMOND
		You'll need an animal behaviorist,
		someone with unimpeachable
		credentials.  I believe you already
		know Sarah Harding.  She's got
		theories about parenting and
		nurturing among hunter/scavengers I
		bet she'd be dying to prove on a
		scale like this.  If you convince her
		to go, it'll be a major coup.  When
		she publishes, the scientific
		community must take it seriously.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, flipping through the file sadly.

				HAMMOND
		Your documentation, you should use
		forensic photographic methods,
		Hasselbladt still cameras, high
		definition video.  When the trick
		photography analysts take your
		evidence apart, make it impossible
		for them to say there was enhancement
		or computer graphic imaging.  Oh,
		this is very important -- avoid the
		island interior at all costs.  Stick
		to the outer rim.  Everything you
		need to know can be found there.
		Vindication lies on the outer rim.

	Malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not going, John.

				HAMMOND
			(fatigue returning)
		Ian, you are my last chance to give
		something of real value to the world.
		I can't walk so far and leave no
		footprints; die and leave nothing
		with my name on it.  I will not  be
		known only for my failures.  And you
		will not allow yourself to go down in
		history as a lunatic.  You're too
		smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr.
		Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance
		at redemption.  For both of us.
		There's no time to equivocate, we
		must seize it now, before --

	He stops, staring over Malcom's shoulder.  Malcom turns.
	PETER LUDLOW, still in his overcoat, is standing in the
	doorway to the bedroom.  He looks back and forth from Hammond
	to Malcolm suspiciously.

				LUDLOW
		Hello, Uncle John.  Dr. Malcolm.

	Malcolm doesn't answer.  He seems to know Ludlow, and dislikes
	him.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Did I interrupt something?

	Malcolm turns back to Hammond.

				MALCOLM
		Find someone else.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HAMMOND'S APARTMENT/FOYER - NIGHT

	In the foyer, LUDLOW hands MALCOLM his coat, just a trifle
	rudely, and shepherds him to the door.

				LUDLOW
		So, you two were just, uh, telling
		old campfire stories, were you?

				MALCOLM
		Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a
		second that you and I don't know the
		truth.  You can convince Time
		magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer
		of whatever you want, but I was 
		there.

				LUDLOW
		You signed a non-disclosure agreement
		before you went to the island that
		expressly forbade you from discussing
		anything you saw.  You violated that
		agreement.

				MALCOLM
		You cost me my livelihood.  That on
		which I relied to support my
		children.

				LUDLOW
		If your university felt you were
		causing it embarrassment by selling
		wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly
		see how I am to--

				MALCOLM
		I didn't tell anything, I told the
		truth.

				LUDLOW
		You version of it.

				MALCOLM
		There are no versions of the truth!
		This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's
		my life.

				LUDLOW
		We made a generous compensatory offer
		for your injuries.

				MALCOLM
		It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen
		never--

				LUDLOW
		InGen is my livelihood, Dr.
		Malcolm, and I will jealously defend
		its interests.  People will know what
		I want them to know when I want them
		to know it.

	Ludlow tosses something to Malcolm, hard.  It sails across the
	foyer, upright, and Malcolm reaches out and catches it with
	one hand.  It's his cane.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Don't forget that.

	Malcolm stares at him for a long moment.  Finally, he turns
	and walks away.

	But he does not out of the apartment.  Instead, he
	walks directly past Ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps
	back into Hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with
	a determined CLICK.

	INT. HAMMOND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	HAMMOND looks up, hopeful, as MALCOLM comes back into the room
	and walks over to his bed.  He reaches down --

	-- and picks up the file folder.

				MALCOLM
		Do you have a satellite phone?

	INT. MOMBASSA BAR - DAY

	ROLAND TEMBO, late sixties, skin like leather and the diamond
	hard look of a cobra, sits at a table in the middle of an
	African cafe/bar in Mombassa.

	It's daytime and the place is half full, mostly with locals,
	but there are a few obnoxious TOURISTS too, Americans on
	safari who somehow found the local handout.

	They're a noisy bunch, but Roland tunes them out, calmly
	eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book,
	eyeglasses hanging low on his nose.

	Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.  He looks
	up.  He SNIFFS the air once, then smiles and calls out a
	person's name.

				ROLAND
		Ajay?

	He turns around.  AJAY (AH-jay) SIDHU, a wiry East Indian in
	his late forties, is standing behind him, caught trying to
	sneak up.

				AJAY
			(delighted)
		How did you know?

				ROLAND
			(taps his nose)
		That cheap aftershave I send you
		every Christmas, you actually wear
		it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit
		down, what brings you to Mombassa?

				AJAY
		You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the
		last time you answered your phone?

				ROLAND
		Last time I plugged it in, I suppose.
		Why?

	Behind them, the group of TOURISTS, all men, laughs loudly.
	One of them, the MOST OBNOXIOUS TOURISTS, berates the WAITRESS.

				AJAY
		I got a call from a gentleman who's
		going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts.
		If he's to be believed, it's a most,
		uh, unique expedition.  And very
		well-funded.

				ROLAND
		Well, I'm a very well-funded old son
		of a bitch.  You go.

	The Most Obnoxious Tourist bellows for the Waitress.  His
	buddies LAUGHS.  Roland throws a glance, annoyed.

				AJAY
		But alone?  We always had great
		success together, you and I.

				ROLAND
		Just a little bit too much, I
		think.

				AJAY
		How do you mean?

				ROLAND
		A true hunter doesn't mind if the
		animal wins.  If it escapes.  But
		there weren't enough escapes from you
		and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend
		a bit less time in the company of
		death.  Maybe I just feel too close
		to it my--

	The Waitress comes to the Tourists' table and the Most
	Obnoxious Tourist actually paws her ass.  Roland is out of his
	chair in a second.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
			(to Ajay)
		Excuse me.

	Romand walks over to the Tourists' table, says something to
	the Waitress in the local dialect, and she walks away, behind
	him.  He stares down at the Most Obnoxious Tourist.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		You, sir -- are no gentleman.

				TOURIST
		Is that supposed to be an insult?

				ROLAND
		I can think of none greater.

	The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs.

				TOURIST
		Buzz off, you silly old bastard.

				ROLAND
		What do I have to do to pick a fight
		with you, bring your mother into it?

				TOURIST
		Are you kidding?  I could take you
		with one arm tied down.

				ROLAND
		Really?

	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR,

	the Waiter finishes tying a man's wrist to his belt in the
	back of his pants with a napkin.  He pulls the knot tight and
	the man turns around.

	It's Roland, with his arm tied down.  The Tourist stands
	across from him.

				TOURIST
		I mean my arm.

	POW!  Roland punches him square in the jaw.  The Tourist
	reels, stunned.  Enraged, he lunges at Roland, swinging with
	both arms.

	Roland bobs, neatly ducking the punches, waits for the Tourist
	to turn around, and POPS him thrice in the face.  The Tourist
	spins and goes down to the floor, face first.  A cloud of
	sawdust and a loud CHEER from the locals rise up in the bar.

	BACK AT HIS TABLE,

	Roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with
	Ajay.  In the background, the Tourist's Buddies hurriedly
	carry their fallen cohort out of the bar.

				ROLAND
		Sorry.  We were saying?

				AJAY
		You broke that idiot's jaw for no
		reason other than your boredom.  Tell
		the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even
		interested in knowing this
		expedition's quarry?

				ROLAND
		Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a
		look around the trophy room, and tell
		me what kind of quarry you think
		could possibly be of any interest
		to me.

	Ajay just smiles.

	EXT. AFRICAN SAVANNAH - NIGHT

	The African savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green,
	seen through night-vision goggles.  An ANIMAL YELP comes from
	the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it.  The
	world blurs momentarily, then comes into focus on a field of
	long grass.

	The grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move
	stealthily through it.  One animal head pops up above the
	grass for a split-second, teeth bared, a white stripe between
	its eyes.  SARAH HARDING pulls the goggles away from her face.

				SARAH
		Hyenas.  Ace Face is the striped
		snout.

	Sarah is thirty, with a compact, athletic body built for the
	outdoors.  She loos through the goggles again, sweeping ahead
	of the hyenas to their prey.

	It's a herd of African buffalo, standing belly-deep in the
	grass, agitated, bellowing and stamping their feet.

	Sarah turns to MAKENA, her African assistant.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They'll try to take down a calf.
		Come on.

				MAKENA
		Closer?

	Sarah scurries up and over a rock face.  Makena follows.
	Closer now, they watch as the hyenas rush the herd, running
	through it, trying to break it up.

				MAKENA (cont'd)
		You know, we could see everything
		from up on the edge of that cliff.

				SARAH
		No way.

				MAKENA
		But the view would --

				SARAH
		No cliffs.
			(into a pocket recorder)
		F1 headed sough, F2 and F5 flanking,
		twenty yards.  F3 center.  F6
		circling wide east.  Can't see F7.

	While she talks, breathless, fascinated by the drama before
	her, Sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action.
	Makena follows, with growing unease.

				MAKENA
		Sarah.

				SARAH
		F8 circling north.  F1 straight
		through, disrupting.  Herd moving,
		stamping.  There's F7.  Straight
		through.  F8 angling through from the
		north.

	She's practically on top of the animals now.

				MAKENA
		Dr. Harding.

	Makena has a hold of Sarah's sweatshirt and is tugging her
	back, at least trying to slow down her progress as Sarah,
	wide-eyed with fascination, creeps even closer.

	Suddenly there is a tremendous BELLOWING and the grass right
	in front of them rips apart, trampled under the feet of the
	hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo calf.  They
	yelp and jump, their muzzles bloody.

	The adults move aside, making room as the hyena pups come
	forward, squealing to get at the kill.  Sarah's eyes shine
	with excitement and she moves even closer, whispering into the
	tape recorder.

				SARAH
		Brooding behavior in evidence at the
		kill site, pups are ushered forward
		and adults help them eat, pulling
		flesh away from the carcass and--

	A telephone rings.

	Sarah stops in mid-sentence, unsure if she heard what she
	thought she heard.  It rings again, the unmistakable CHIRPING
	of a cellular phone.  Sarah and Makena both move at once,
	pawing at a backpack.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			(a frantic whisper)
		I thought you turned it off!

	Two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone.
	Sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Yes?!

	Someone speaks on the other end.  Sarah rolls her eyes.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Ian.  This better be important.

	Sarah doesn't say anything for a long moment, just listens as
	the voice on the other end talks.  And talks.

				MALCOLM
		We leave in twenty-four hours.  Five

	Behind them, the SPARKS of a acetylene torch fly as WORKMEN
	make modifications on several vehicles, including a dark-green
	Mercedes Benz AAV (all-activity vehicle).  The hood of the AAV
	is up and the V-6 engine has been pulled out; a new, smaller
	engine is lowered in its place.  To one side are two long
	trailers, connected by an accordion-like passageway, like on a
	subway car, allowing one to be towed behind the other.

				MALCOLM

				EDDIE
		No, no, look at the plans, Henry,
		you can't place that strut laterally,
		it has to be crosswise, LOOK AT THE
		PLANS!

	From the ceiling, a large metal age CRASHES down, landing
	next to them on the floor with a deafening CLANG.  They leap
	back and look up.  A WORKMAN waves from a scaffolding.

				WORKMAN
		Sorry, Eddie!  Specs say it can't

		it

	Eddie bends down to inspect the cage, which is rectangular,
	constructed of inch-thick titanium-alloy bars.  Malcolm hangs
	up the phone and walks up, joining him.

				MALCOLM
		Any damage?

				EDDIE
		Minimal.

				MALCOLM
		"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be
		light, it has to be strong --

				EDDIE
		Light and strong, light and strong,

		God save me from academics.

				MALCOLM
		You are an academic.

	breaks into a wide grin.

		Hi, Dad.

		know.  Not just when it's convenient.

				MALCOLM
		Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you
		to say that?

				KELLY
		No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own
		once in a while.

	From the construction floor, EDDIE calls out.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Dr. Malcolm!

	Malcolm looks at her, trying to make peace.  Quickly.

				MALCOLM
		Is that kid still bothering you?

				KELLY
		Which one?

				MALCOLM
		You know, at the bus stop.  With the
		hair?

				KELLY
		That was about a year ago.

				MALCOLM
		Well, is he?

				KELLY
		No.  Richard talked to his parents.

				MALCOLM
		That Richard.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Ian, come here a minute!

				KELLY
			(to Malcolm)
		I could come with you.

				MALCOLM
		Out of the question.  You'd miss the
		gymnastics trials.  You've been
		training for that for a year.

				KELLY
		I don't care about the trials, I
		want to be with you.  I could be your
		research assistant, like I was in
		Austin.

				MALCOLM
		This is nothing like Austin.  Forget
		about it.

				KELLY
		You like to have kids, you just
		don't want to be with them, do you?

	He looks at her, hurt.  Eddie calls out a third time,
	impatient now.  Grateful for the escape, Malcolm gets up and
	heads for the door.  He pauses guiltily.

				MALCOLM
		I'm not like you wan me to be.  I've
		what I can be.

	He leaves.

	INT. MAIN FLOOR - DAY

	While MALCOLM and EDDIE argue over something in the
	background, KELLY circles around the trailers and looks up at
	the windows.  They're all made of tempered glass, fine wire
	mesh inside it.  She looks around, to see if anybody's
	watching.  They're not, so she quickly slips inside the front
	trailer.

	INT. TRAILER - DAY

	Inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design.  It's
	divided into sections, for different laboratory functions.
	The main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays,
	dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video
	monitors.

	Next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of
	processors, and a communications section.  All the lab
	equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that
	slides into the walls.  Everything is bolted down.

	She notices a large map on the wall.  Off the coat of Costa
	Rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black
	ink.

	Kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the
	Pacific Ocean.  Thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in
	the highlighted region, there is a semi-circle of five.
	Matanceros.  Muerte.  Tacano.  Pena.  And Sorna.  Underneath
	the whole island chain, there is a bold legend.

	"The Five Deaths," it says.

	Slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the
	face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters
	of those three ominous words.

							DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. OPEN SEA - DAY

	The map dissolves slowly away as the barge SPALASEHS through
	five foot ocean swells in the open sea.  The barge is crammed
	with equipment, the AAV, trailers, a jeep, and the members of
	Malcolm's team.

	ON THE BOAT,

	MALCOLM stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas.  Next to
	him, DR. JUTTSON, fortyish, holds onto the railing,
	seasick.  He SHOUTS over the DRONE of the boat's engines.

				JUTTISON
			(as the waves pound the
			 boat)
		Couldn't -- we just -- airlift --
		into the -- island?

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea!
		Helicopters are too disruptive.
		These aren't piles of bones you'll be
		studying this time, Dr. Juttson, they
		live, they breathe, and they react!

	Juttson looks at him skeptically --

	-- and throws up.

	AT THE BACK OF THE BOAT,

	NICK VAN OWEN, a good-looking American in his late
	twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other
	photographic equipment, playing with a Game Bow.  SARAH
	HARDING, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.

				SARAH
		So what's your story, Nick?

				NICK
		I was a cameraman for Nightline for
		six years, been freelance since '91.
		Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		That must be interesting.  What drew
		you there?

				NICK
		Women.  'Bout eighty percent female
		in Greenpeace.

				SARAH
		Very noble of you.
			(of the noisy Game Boy)
		You don't think you're bringing that
		thing onto the island, do you?

	Nick grins and shuts it off.

				NICK
		Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the
		woolly mammoths.

				SARAH
		You think this is all a joke?

				NICK
		Oh, please.  How am I supposed to
		keep a straight face when --
			(gestures to the
			 black-clad Malcolm)
		-- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm
		going to Skull Island?

				SARAH
			(not amused)
		Ian's a very good friend of mine.

				NICK
		He doesn't need a friend, he needs a
		shrink.

				SARAH
		I believe in him.

	But her face says even she has her doubts.

				NICK
		Come on, there's only one reason any
		of us are here.  His check cleared.

	She looks at him.

				SARAH
		Drop the cynical pose.  You can't
		pull it off while playing Donkey
		Kong.

	The boat's CAPTAIN, a Costa Rican, points ahead and SHOUTS to
	them.

				CAPTAIN
		There it is!

	They all turn and look out over the bow.  Up ahead, shear,
	reddish-gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of
	the fog-heavy ocean.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		Isla Sorna!

	The boat ROARS ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog.  The
	mist swirls and encircles it.

	EXT. ISLAND FIORD - DAY

	A narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs, leading to the
	island interior.  The barge bursts through the fog at the
	mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island.

	EXT. LAGOON - DAY

	Lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon.
	Sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground, bleaching the
	nearby foliage white.  In the distance one can hear the cries
	of JUNGLE BIRDS.

	The boat is now beached and the CREW flips the tarps off the
	AAV, the jeep, and the trailers.  The trucks back down a
	narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the
	lagoon.  There is a large three-toad animal imprint in the
	clay at the water's edge, and the AAV backs right over it,
	swapping its track for the animal's.

	MALCOLM is at the edge of the water with the CAPTAIN.

				MALCOLM
		Be back in three days, but keep the
		satellite phone on and your radio
		tuned to the frequency I specified in
		case we need you sooner.

				CAPTAIN
		Don't worry.  I've lived around here
		all my life, these islands are
		completely --

	In the distance, they hear the faint, strange ROAR of a very
	large animal.  The Captain looks at Malcolm, eyes wide.

				CAPTAIN (cont'd)
		-- safe.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. GRASSY PLAIN - DAY

	The jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain
	just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the
	island.  The noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley
	shimmers in midday heat.

	EDDIE connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and
	flicks it on.  The cable turns slowly in the sunlight.  Moving
	along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of
	aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage
	color.

	As the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts
	begins to move, slowly rising into the air.  The emerging
	structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into
	the air.  The light house at the top (the cage that was
	tested back at Eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the
	lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it
	from view.

	NICK lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the
	ground.  Malcolm notices.

				MALCOLM
		Listen.  I know you all have probably
		concluded that I'm out of my mind.

	Is it our imagination, or did the trees behind Malcolm just
	sway slightly?

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		That's all right, for now.  But just
		humor me and be careful.

	No, it's not our imagination, there they go again.  Whole
	trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back
	again.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even if you think I'm harmless and
		deluded, I promise --

	Now the trees CREAKS and GROAN as they sway.  Everyone has seen
	it, and now Malcolm turns around too.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		-- this place is for real.

							CUT TO:

	INT. DOUBLE TRAILERS - DAY

	It's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command
	post/living quarters.  The books are lined up neatly on the
	shelves.  The computers sit, booted up and awaiting data
	input.

	All the way in the back, past the spare tires and life
	preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one
	storage bin all the way on top, there's a RUSTLING SOUND.

	A plastic student ID card pops out in the cracks under the
	bin's door.  A photograph in the lower right hand corner of
	the card is visible -- it's Kelly, Malcolm's twelve-year-old
	daughter.

	The card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft CLICK, the
	door pops open.  KELLY herself tumbles out, wrapped in several
	blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish
	liquid.  We can guess.

	She leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and
	bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can.
	She races through a narrow door and SLAMS it shut.

	A sign on the door says "RESTROOM."  Inside, a SIGH of relief
	is heard.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Along a stream bed, the jungle trees still shiver.  NICK loads
	a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and
	chews anxiously on a piece of gum.  SARAH and DR. JUTTSON are
	beside him as the group nervously follows the GROANING forest
	trees to their right.

	At the rear, EDDIE and MALCOLM walk side by side.  Eddie is
	carrying a heavy silver rifle, an aluminum canister hanging
	beneath the barrel.  He shows it to Malcolm, his voice low and
	urgent.

				EDDIE
		Lindstradt air rifle.  Fires a
		subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart.

	He cracks open the cartridge bank, revealing a row of plastic
	containers filled with straw-colored liquid.  Each is tipped
	with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning
	tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!  LETHAL TOXICITY!"

				EDDIE (cont'd)
		I loaded the enhanced venom of Conus
		purpurascens, the South Sea cone
		shell.  Most powerful neurotoxin in
		the world.  Acts within a
		two-thousandth of a second.  Faster
		than the nerve-conduction velocity.
		The animal's down before it feels the
		prick of the dart.

	From their right, the shaking trees seen closer now.  By
	walking down the stream bed, the humans are tracking right
	along with the animals as they move in the foliage.

				MALCOLM
			(to Eddie)
		Is there an antidote?

				EDDIE
		Like if you shoot yourself in the
		foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be
		dead  before you realized you'd
		accidentally pulled the trigger.

	Ahead of them, thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up
	stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet.  But around
	them, the CRASHING sounds get louder and closer, the swaying
	trees shiver right beside them.  Eddie raises the rifle in
	defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway
	and part.  Above the foliage, they see the sudden
	movement --

	-- of a row of STEGOSAUR fins.  The spade-shaped fins run
	along a ridge down the middle of the animal's back, about
	three feet tall each.  The group freezes, amazed, and as the
	stegosaur continues on, they get a good look at it through a
	break in the foliage.

	It's a large dinosaur with a small head, a thick neck, and a
	huge lumbering body.

	A double row of plates runs along the crest of its back, and
	it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it.

	The gum drops out of Nick's mouth, FLOPS onto his shirt, and
	sticks there.

				NICK
		Oh --

				JUTTSON
		-- my --

				EDDIE
		-- God!

				SARAH
		It's beautiful!

	A second stegosaur, a baby about a quarter the size of the
	first animal, breaks through the foliage, following the adult.

	While the group is reaching to that, the earth vibrates and
	a third stego, by far the biggest of the three, walks out of
	the foliage right behind them, crossing within ten feet.

	Apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their
	environment, the stegos continue on across the stream bed.

	Sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures.  Her shutter
	is muted, so that a muffled CLICK is all that's audible.

	Juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into
	it breathlessly.

				JUTTSON
		Stegosaurus, family Stegosauridae,
		infraorder Stegosauria, suborder
		Thyreophora.  Length, adult male,
		estimate twenty-five to thirty feet.

	His breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter, of all
	things, as he can't contain his astonishment.  Eddie covers
	his mouth, trying to keep him quiet.

				SARAH
			(to Juttsn)
		That was a pair bond!  A family
		group, even, long after that infant
		was nestbound!

				JUTTSON
		I want to see the nesting ground!

	Nick turns to Malcolm, eyes like saucers, and makes a futile,
	wordless, boy-was-I-wrong-on-this-one gesture.  Malcolm
	smiles, leans over, and TAPS softly on Nick's video camera.
	Nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group
	continues on into the bush after the animals.

	IN THE BUSH,

	the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near
	where Sarah crouches in the bushes.  Sarah raises her camera
	again and silently SNAPS a picture.  She WHISPERS to Juttson,
	who is beside her.

				SARAH
		Lone nest -- not colonial.  I don't
		see an egg clutch...

	She gestures and Juttson peers through a pair of field
	glasses.

				JUTTSON
			(whispering back)
		The empty shells are crushed and
		trampled.  The young stay in the
		birth environment, that's conclusive!

				SARAH
		Not without a shot of the nest.

	She sees an opportunity.  As the baby heads back to its
	parents, Sarah scoots right along with it, moving behind it,
	using its body as a shield to block her from the view of the
	other two.

	Nick and Eddie's faces whiten in alarm.  Nick reaches out to
	stop her, but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot
	before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the
	clearing.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back,
	toward the nest, chewing the branches it carries in its south.
	She raises up sightly, squeezing off pictures of the herd,
	ever better as she gets closer.

	BACK AT THE HILL,

	the others can only watch her, aghast.

				NICK
		She's gutty.

				MALCOLM
		She's nuts.

	IN THE CLEARING,

	Sarah keeps moving closer.  The baby passes a small grouping
	of rocks and Sarah ducks behind them.  She's now in a perfect
	position to photograph the nest, and she squeezes off picture
	after picture from this ideal vantage point.

	She shoots the last picture on the roll --

	-- and the camera's autowinder WHIRS to life.  Sarah looks
	down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her
	hands.

	Th noise startles the animals.  The male turns toward her
	the plates on its back bristling.  Sarah gets to her feet and
	starts to move away, slowly.

	The male turns away from her and swings its tail, spikes
	extended.  It WHIZZES through the air, right at her, but Sarah
	leaps back at the last second --

	-- and the tail's spikes THUD into the dirt where she was.

	Sarah CRUNCHES to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart
	away, disappearing into the bush, moving surprisingly quickly
	for animals their size.

	The others run to Sarah, help her to her feet, and pull her
	back, against a massive tree trunk.  But the tree trunk lifts
	right up off the ground.

	It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet
	across, God knows how many feet high.  The Group gasps and
	looks up as a MAKENCHIASAURUS, an enormous saurupod over a
	hundred feet from nose to tail,  lumbers away from them.

	The Group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and
	HONKS furtively, its long neck stretched out above them.

	Now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the
	surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first.  The
	first mamenchiasaur THUNDERS around in a semi-circle, getting
	into position behind the second.

	Nick swings his video camera straight up and the group
	suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating.

	The mighty tails swing and SNAP around them as the two animals
	come together, and trees start snapping and falling, CRASHING
	to the jungle floor.

	The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place
	where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath
	the animals!

	Amid HONKS and BLEATS, the swinging tails continue to deforest
	the jungle around them.

	The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER
	and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.

	There is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from
	underneath the animals, disappearing into the thick forest.

	A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY,

	the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving
	with wild, frightened laughter.  Sarah goes to Malcolm and
	throws her arms around him, exhilarated.

				SARAH
		Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so
		glad!

				JUTTSON
			(out of breath)
		Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you
		an apology.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE TRAIL - DAY

	Suddenly, the Gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more
	seriously.  They march quickly back to base camp, their energy
	and excitement palpable.  NICK strikes a match and raises it
	to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but SARAH leans in and
	blows it out.

				SARAH
		No more smoking.  We leave no scent
		of any kind.  No hair tonics, no
		cologne, seal all our food in plastic
		bags.  We will observe and document,
		but we will not interact.

				MALCOLM
		That's a scientific impossibility,
		you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty
		principle.  Whatever you study, you
		also change.

	Nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a
	sharpie, to label it.

				NICK
		What should I call this?  "Jurassic
		Pork?"

	Eddie, next to him, laughs.

				SARAH
			(still to Malcolm)
		And let's forget about the high hide.
		We can't do this kind of work up in a
		tower, we need to be out in the
		field, as close to the animals as
		possible.

				JUTTSON
		I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in
		a family group, but there's never
		been anything in the fossil record to
		prove the carnivores did.

				SARAH
		Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas,
		jackals, nearly all species of
		predator birds --

				JUTTSON
		That doesn't say a thing about T-rex,
		they could have been rogues.  Robert
		Burke certainly thinks they were.

				SARAH
		We've got to see one to find out.
		Is there any --

				MALCOLM
		No way.

				NICK
		Oh, my God.

				SARAH
		-- way we could safely --

				NICK
		Oh, no!

	He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail,
	toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is
	running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.

				EDDIE
		Fire!

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

	NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume
	of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly
	built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the
	middle.

	Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge
	from the trees behind him.

				MALCOLM
		A campfire?!

	Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in.

				SARAH
		No!  Water mixes the smoke billow,
		use dirt!

	They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their
	hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out.

				MALCOLM
		Who the hell started a campfire?!

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It was just to make lunch.

	Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in
	the doorway of the trailer, sheepish.

				KELLY (cont'd)
			I wanted it ready when you got back.

	The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm
	himself.

				MALCOLM
		Oh ... man.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER

	Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON,
	NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the
	fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera
	equipment, packing up specimen containers and other
	information-gathering equipment.

	MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly.

				MALCOLM
		You know you were putting yourself in
		a potentially dangerous situation,
		but you didn't bother to find out
		how dangerous before you leapt in.
		You don't have the faintest idea
		what's going on on this island!

				SARAH
			(loading a backpack)
		What do you want to do, Ian, lock her
		up for curiosity?  Where do you think
		she gets it?

				JUTTSON
			(to Nick)
		Do you have chromium tapes?  The
		others fog in high-

				NICK
		-humidity, I know.
			(waving a tape)
		Highest lead density on the market.

				EDDIE
			(to Malcolm)
		We've got a lot of heavy marching
		ahead of us.  I'm not carrying 
		anybody.

				KELLY
		I can keep up.

				MALCOLM
		You're going home.  I'm sending a
		radio call for the boats.  We'll all
		go down to the lagoon and wait for
		them.

				SARAH
		Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a
		high school vice-principal.

				MALCOLM
		I'm her father.

				KELLY
		Sure, now.

	Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm
	and Kelly.

				NICK
		Do you see any family resemblance
		here?

				MALCOLM
		You can't stay, Kelly, that's it.
		It's too dangerous.

				SARAH
		If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring
		any of us?

				KELLY
		You're wrong, Dad.  I do know
		what's going on on this island.

				MALCOLM
		How could you possibly?

				KELLY
		Because you said so.  Maybe nobody
		else believed you, but I always
		did.

	He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again.

				NICK
		The kid scores with cheap sentiment.

				SARAH
		Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've
		made two invasive landings in one
		day.  That'll have to go in any paper
		I write, and it will leave room for
		people to say our findings were
		contaminated.  You know the academic
		world as well as I do, once they
		smell blood in the water, you're
		dead.  Our presence has got to be one
		hundred percent antiseptic.  That
		means if we bend a blade of grass, we
		bend it right back the way it-

	A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes
	BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that
	shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130
	military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the
	island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous,
	fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

	AT A RIDGE,

	the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer
	over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a
	specific spot.

	Eddie raises a pair of field glasses.

	DOWN BELOW,

	huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the
	cargo bays.  They SNAP off trees like matchsticks, CRUSH flat
	anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land.

	Now MEN pour out the rear of the planes, their low-altitude
	parachutes billowing open behind them.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick looks at Sarah.

				NICK
		You were saying something about
		antiseptic?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - DAY

	Metal container doors CLANG to the ground, jeep engines ROAR
	to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser
	barriers SIZZLE and BURN through foliage as this group of
	HUNTERS establishes a perimeter around their new camp.

	PETER LUDLOW, dressed in brand new Banana Republic safari
	wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the
	surroundings.  He turns to DR. ROBERT BURKE, a ragged,
	pony-tailed man in wire-rimmed glasses.

				LUDLOW
		Welcome to your dream come true, Dr.
		Burke.

	Burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that
	he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.

				BURKE
		I believe the large herbivores forage
		in open plains, like bison, which
		would explain the great variety of
		heat dots we're reading in the
		flatlands around this waterhole.
		Right -- here.

				LUDLOW
		Then that's where we're going.

	Burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all
	times.  Inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds
	underneath.  As each vehicle ROARS out of the equipment
	container, Burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an
	icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the
	dashboard.

				BURKE
			(calling them off)
		Hadrosaurus!  Carinthosaurus!
		Maiasaurus!

	As the procession goes on, Ludlow turns to DIETER STARK, the
	man we saw welding earlier.

				LUDLOW
		This is as good a place as any for
		base camp.  First priority is the
		laser barriers, I want them all up
		and running in thirty minutes.  Half
		an hour, understand?

	Dieter nods and turns to some of the HUNTERS, who number about
	twenty in all, that are working nearby.  But someone steps in
	front of Dieter, cutting him off.  It's ROLAND TEMBO, the
	hunter from the bar in Mombassa.

				ROLAND
		Cancel that, Dieter.

				LUDLOW
		What?  Why?

	Roland points to a stream running nearby.

				ROLAND
		Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do
		you want to set up base camp or an
		all-you-can-eat people bar?

				LUDLOW
			(thinks)
		You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new
		spot.  And remember, we're after
		herbivores only -- no unnecessary
		risks.

	Dieter SIGHS and goes to work.  Roland puts an arm around
	Ludlow and pulls him aside.

				ROLAND
		Peter, if you want me to run your
		little camping trip, there are two
		conditions.  First -- I'm in
		charge, and when I'm not around,
		Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the
		checks, tell us we're doing a good
		job, and open your case of scotch
		when we have a good day.  Second
		condition -- my fee.  You can keep
		it.  All I want in exchange for my
		services is the right to hunt one of
		the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck
		only.  Why and how are my business.
		If you don't  like either of those
		conditions, you're on your own.  Go
		ahead and set up your camp right
		here, or in a swamp, or in the middle
		of a rex nest, for all I care.  But
		I've been on too many safaris with
		rich dentists to listen to any more
		suicidal ideas.  Okay?

				LUDLOW
			(what else can he say?)
		Okay.

				ROLAND
		Good lad.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE

	The jungle foliage shivers, quakes, and finally falls as the
	Hunters' convoy ROARS into the hart of the jungle.  DIETER
	STARK stands in the front of the lead vehicle, the
	"speedbird," waving the convoy forward, his Driver (CARTER) at
	the wheel beside him.

	LUDLOW is in the back seat of the speedbird next to DR. BURKE.
	ROLAND and AJAY, his tracker, are in the second jeep.  They
	look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car
	stops, forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well.

	In the front, the speedbird flashes its lights at something in
	front of it.  Dieter climbs out, plainly irritated.  He walks
	around the front of the car and sees --

	-- four PACHYCEPHALOSAURS eating grass in the middle of the
	jungle trail.  They're about five feet tall, thick, heavy-set
	animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing,
	a tall, impressive crown that rises on the tops of their
	heads.  Dieter doesn't seem impressed.  He looks back at
	Ludlow, who look at Dr. Burke.

	Burke stands up in his seat, a look of wonder on his face.

				BURKE
		Pachycephalosaurus!

				LUDLOW
		Carnivore?

				BURKE
			(enchanted)
		Huh?  No!  No, herbivore, late
		Cretaceous.  Very unusual plant
		eater, see that distinctive domed
		skull?  That's nine inches of solid
		bone.

				LUDLOW
			(who cares?)
		Just get them out of the way, Dieter.

				DIETER
		COME ON, MOVE IT!!

	The pachys look up at him sluggishly, still eating, like cows
	chewing their cuds.  As unimpressive with him as he is with
	them, they go back to their grass.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Oh, for God's --

	He slings his rifle off his  shoulder and aims it at the
	closest animal.  Behind him, Roland has climbed out of the
	second jeep.

				ROLAND
		Dieter.  This is a round-up, not a
		war.  Use your powers of persuasion.

	Dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead, which it does,
	slowly, toward the animals.  The pachys look up, alert, but do
	not move.  Dieter walks toward them.

				DIETER
		Come on, come on, don't have all
		day!

				BURKE
			(going on to no one in
			 particular)
		See, the pachy's neck attaches at the
		bottom of its skull instead of the
		back of its head, as with reptiles.

	The speedbird draws closer.  The first pachy stares at it
	intently.  The lead vehicle gets closer, closer --

	-- and BANGS into the pachy, knocking it back a few feet, out
	of the way.

				BURKE (cont'd)
		So when it lowers its head, its neck
		lines up directly with its
		backbone --

	BEHIND DIETER,

	Ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet.  He
	takes a few steps further into the foliage, then turns back
	toward Roland.

				AJAY
		Roland.

	UP AT THE FRONT,

	the pachys turn and hop away.  Dieter turns and heads back to
	the speedbird.  As he reaches for the door, a VOICE calls
	"look out!" from behind him.  Dieter spins around, just in
	time to see --

	-- the first pachy in full charge.  It SLAMS headfirst into
	the speedbird, SMASHING the headlights and denting the grill.

				BURKE
			(concluding his lecture)
		Which is perfect for absorbing
		impact.

	Dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car.  The
	pachy has backed up  for another run and is now CHARGING RIGHT
	AT HIM.

	Dieter retreats, quickly, and rips open the passenger door to
	protect himself.

	SLAM!  The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying
	against the car, knocking the wind out of him.

	In the other jeeps, the rest of the HUNTERS stand up or lean
	out the window for a better look, laughing.

	POW!!  The pachy head-butts the tire next to Dieter.  It
	bounces off, tumbles to the ground, and rolls to its feet as
	Dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the
	speedbird.

	But the pachy is quicker and lunges at Dieter again.  He's
	forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the
	speedbird, just as the animal SLAMS into the rear of the
	vehicle.

	Now the other three animals join the jun.  Ludlow and the
	Driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the
	car again and again, SMASHING the steel-meshed windows and
	MANGLING the quarter panels.  The rest of the group watches,
	vastly amused.

	A FEW STEPS INTO THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay and Roland are staring at something on the ground -- an
	animal footprint, three-toed, enormous.

				AJAY
		It matches the pictures.

				ROLAND
		It certainly does.

	Roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle, ignoring the
	pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird.
	Roland opens a case in the back of the jeep, revealing --

	-- his gun.  It's an antique elephant gun, a double barreled
	.600 Nitro Express.  Nearly a hundred years old, it's still in
	immaculate condition, its rosewood stock buttery smooth,
	bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach.

	The barrels are twenty-four inches long, topped with an ivory
	bead foresight at the business end.  Roland scoops up the gun,
	breaks the breach, and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his
	shirt pocket.

	Four inches long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
	these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made.
	He slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush.

	Roland pauses before he goes, as if noticing the animals
	trashing the speedbird for the first time.

				ROLAND
		HEY!

	The pachys all freeze, staring at him.  Roland waves one hand,
	HISSES sharply between his teeth --

	-- and the pachys scatter, back into the jungle.  Takes care
	of that problem.  Roland turns and heads back into the jungle,
	calling out over his shoulder to Ludlow.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Don't worry about us.  We'll catch
		up.

				LUDLOW
		Where do you think you're going?!

				ROLAND
		To collect my fee.

	And with that he disappears into the foliage.

	The Driver of the Speedbird drops it into gear and the
	battered car GROANS forward.  As it moves ahead, it reveals
	DIETER, lying underneath it, ego bruised worse than body.

	IN THE JUNGLE,

	Ajay takes a step into the bush, but at a ninety degree
	angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks
	lead.

				ROLAND
		Ajay.

	Ajay turns.  Roland points in the direction in which the
	footprints lead.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		I'm no tracker, but even I can read
		this spoor.

				AJAY
		Do you wish to go where the animal
		has been, or where the animal is?

	Roland smiles.  Ajay sets off in his direction and Roland
	follows.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DAY

	Seen from a ridge above them, the hunters' convoy continues to
	plow through the jungle.  But how the hunters themselves are
	being tracked, followed by the GATHERERS.  They scurry along
	as fast as they can, trying to keep pace with the moving
	vehicle below.

				EDDIE
		Why didn't you tell us about these
		guys, Ian?!

				MALCOLM
		Because I didn't know!  I don't have
		the faintest idea what they're doing
		here.

				NICK
			(angry)
		Ruining everything, that's what
		they're doing.  You could choke on
		the diesel smoke already!

				SARAH
		Ian, nothing we observe will be valid
		if we're trailing along in the wake
		of an army.

	Kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as
	they move below.

				KELLY
		"InGen."  What's InGen?

				MALCOLM
		Where does it say that?

				KELLY
		On the side of that one truck.

	Malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself.

				JUTTSON
		InGen is a genetics corporation,
		isn't it?

				NICK
			(to Malcolm)
		Is that who we're really working
		for?!  Gene splicers?!

				MALCOLM
		No!  We're an independently funded
		expedition.

				SARAH
		Funded by whom?

				MALCOLM
		John Hammond.

				JUTTSON
		But he's the head of InGen!

				NICK
		You gotta be kidding.
			(to Malcolm)
		You dragged me out of Greenpeace to
		be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't
		get anybody else?

				KELLY
		Yeah, what have you done, Dad?

				SARAH
		We'd better keep moving, or we'll
		lose them.

	The group moves on ahead, but Malcolm lingers, angry, staring
	through the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		What are you doing to me, John?

							CUT TO:

	EXT. THE CAVES - DAY

	AJAY and ROLAND make their way through the foliage and come
	into a small clearing, where a cluster of caves is carved into
	the rock.  Ajay freezes, gesturing ahead, to the cave on the
	far left.

	Roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the
	breeze.  It floats back between his legs.  That's good.

	He proceeds toward the cave, carefully, Ajay behind him.  They
	can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave, only a
	black interior.

	Roland pauses, looking down.  On the ground to his right he
	sees the partially eastern leg of a creature.  It's old,
	crawling with white maggots and flies.

	Roland continues on.  Closer to the cave, he now passes the
	skull of a large animal, some of the flesh and green skin
	still adhering to the bone.  It, too, is covered with flies.

	Still he continues on.  A short rise leads into the cave, and
	they edge up it.  From inside the cave, they can hear an odd
	SQUEAKING sound, very high-pitched.

	Crawling now, Roland and Ajay scale a four-foot circular
	rampart of dried mud, and peer into --

	-- the tyrannosaur nest.  It's flattered inside, about ten
	feet in diameter, completely encircled by earthen walls.

	A BABY TYRANNOSAUR, about four and a half feet long, is in the
	center of the nest.  It has a large head, very large eyes, and
	its body is covered with a fluffy red down, which gives it a
	scraggly appearance.

	It SQUEAKS repeatedly, tearing awkwardly at the remains of a
	chunk of animal flesh, biting decisively with tiny, sharp
	teeth.

	The cave itself is a foul boneyard.  ANIMAL CARCASSES litter
	the edges, flies BUZZ in the captive air.  Roland raises a
	bandana to his nose to cover the stench.  He  turns to Ajay and
	WHISPERS.

				ROLAND
		It's the rex nest.

	Ajay nods.  The baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks
	up, cocking its head in curiosity.

				AJAY
		Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck
		to return?

				ROLAND
			(shakes his head no)
		If the nest is upwind, so are we.
		When he comes back, he'll know we're
		here before we have a chance.  The
		truck --

	In the nest below, the baby SQUEAKS angrily at the intruders.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		-- is to get him to come where we
		want him.

	The baby SQUEAKS again, indignant.  Roland turns and looks
	down at it.  Thinking.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - DUSK

	As the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, NICK raises a
	pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista
	below the ridge.

	In the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed
	herd of midsized herbivores -- HARDOSAURS, PACHYCEPHALOSAURS,
	and CALLIMIMUSES -- racing across the plain below.
	
	MALCOLM, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge
	beside him.  SARAH is several feet behind them, her back
	pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the
	ridge.

	THROUGH NICK'S BINOCULARS

	We see a shaky point of view of the herd running.  The
	binoculars whip to the right --

	-- revealing a jeep chasing the herd  Not just one jeep, in
	fact, but a whole FLEET OF HUNTER PURSUIT VEHICLES!

	There are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier
	mini-jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a
	wrangler's pickup truck.

	Although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's
	almost eerily silent.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick lowers the binoculars, angry.  When he raises them again,
	the sun FLARES off the lens --

	EXT. THE PLAIN - DUSK

	-- and when the brilliant flare clears, we're right down in
	the middle of the roundup.  Engines ROAR, wheels spin and dig
	in the dirt, men SHOUT and radios SQUAWK as the hunter
	vehicles pursue the fleeting herd they're flushed.

	The HUNTER SHOUT and SHRIEK with glee, incredulous and
	thrilled by the spectacular animals they're pursuing.

				HUNTER
		LOOK AT THESE THINGS!

				HUNTER 2
		THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, MAN, THEY'RE
		BEAUTIFUL!!!

	One of the pursuit vehicles (a "snagger"), pulls ahead of the
	others.  DIETER STARK stands in the passenger seat, holding a
	long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it.

	He swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and SHOUTS to
	the driver.

				DIETER
		FASTER!

	The Driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward, gaining
	on the herd.  Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers
	to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle --

	-- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting
	them off, herding them back out into the open.

	BACK IN THE CONTAINER TRUCK,

	PETER LUDLOW stands in a "conning tower," a command post in
	the heaviest pursuit vehicle.  He BARKS into a walkie-talkie.

				LUDLOW
		Alive, Dieter, and uninjured!

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	the Driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints
	thrown by the herd ahead of him.  Dieter CURSES and throws the
	lasso pole into the back of the jeep.  Ludlow's voice
	continues over the radio in Dieter's jeep.

				LUDLOW (o.s.)
		Those are very expensive animals!
		Can you hear me?!

				DIETER
			(to the Driver)
		Turn that off!

	The Driver SNAPS off the radio as Dieter grabs a long-barreled
	rifle from the back of the vehicle.

	THE MOTORCYCLE

	guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the 
	plain.  From the trees to the left, two heads on enormous
	necks rise up in alarm.  Two APATOSAURS are startled from the
	bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain.

	The herd doesn't even break stride, but keeps running,
	scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their
	massive legs.

	One smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose, but the motorcycle
	cuts it off and herds it back into the middle, which now takes
	the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs of
	the apotosaurs.

	The bike chases the pachy out the other side, and as the
	apatosaurs disappear into the distance, the cycle isolates the
	juvenile.

	Another truck, a "scissor rig," spots the isolated animal.
	High in the back of the truck, a HUNTER mans a tranquilizer
	cannon, drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down.

	He FIRES and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the
	neck.  Its pace slows and another HUNTER from the truck tosses
	a lasso around its neck.

	They crank a winch, reeling in the animal.

	As the truck gain on it, two six-foot padded arms with what
	look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of
	the truck.

	As the animal is pulled in, the scissors close with a
	hydraulic WHIR, trapping the animal between its airbags.

	Now a pick-up rig ROARS up and drops its back gate.  The
	scissor rig rolls forward, depositing the squirming pachy in
	this dino-contaiment vehicle.

	Two HUNTERS throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and
	the scissor rig backs away, leaving the animal, still pinched
	between the bars, imprisoned in the back of the pick-up rig.

	The Hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig
	and it takes off, back into the hunt.

	BACK ON THE SNAGGER,

	Dieter, rifle in hand, drops down into the passenger seat,
	whips a harness over himself and CLICKS it into place.  He
	jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard.

	Immediately, a motor underneath the seat HUMS to life and the
	seat itself telescopes, extending a good four feet out to

	Dieter raises the gun, picks a CARINTHOSAUR, a red-crested
	herbivore, from the rear of the fleeting herd, and takes aim.

	BANG!!

	The carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in
	its left hindquarter.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	there is utter quiet.  Nick and the others stare wordlessly at
	the spectacle below.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	the snagger SHUDDERS to a halt in the dirt, kicking up a huge
	cloud of dust and dirt.

	The motorcycle spins to a stop beside it, its DRIVER pushing
	his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt-streaked face.

	The wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door, which
	CLANGS heavily to the ground.

	FOUR WRANGLERS carrying wire noose poles and chains race down
	the ramp and out of the truck.

	Dieter jumps off the snagger.  He puts down his tranquilizer
	gun, picks up a long steel rod, and walks forward slowly.
	Ahead of him, the carinthosaur is still on its feet.

	The sedated animal staggers, fighting to retain its balance
	while it is surrounded by the wary Wranglers.

				DIETER
		Easy -- easy -- not too close!
		Full extension!

	The Wranglers adjust their poles, extending them another three
	feet, which allows them to stay further from the reeling, ten
	foot tall animal.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		Now!

	Almost as one, the Wranglers flip their noose over the
	stunned animal's neck.  It thrashes, but the Wranglers hold
	their poles tightly, surrounding and immobilizing it.

	UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Nick turns away.  He can't watch.

	DOWN ON THE PLAIN,

	a bolero-type device, a rope with a round weight at either
	end, whips around the carinthosaur's legs.  The animal THUDS
	to the dirt with a SNORT of a defeat.

	Ludlow steps up next to Dieter and both of them stare down at
	the helpless animal.  Ludlow's breathing heavily, eyes
	glowing.

	The animal is still thrashing, pumping its legs crazily.
	Dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod he's holding
	and thrusts it into the defenseless animal's neck.

	A blue arc of electricity CRACKS and dances over the
	carinthosaur's body.  The animal convulses in pain, a
	horrible, high-pitched SQUEALING rips the air.

	DR. BURKE, their paleontologist, hurries forward with a
	syringe.

	He draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and
	injects it into the animal's thigh.

	CARTER, Dieter's Driver, steps up with a can of spray paint
	and quickly tags the animal with an ID number in day-glo
	orange.

	Dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the
	dashboard of the jeep and marks a black X over the drawing of
	the animal.

				DIETER
		Next case.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

	Night has fallen over the island.  The hunters have
	established base camp in an area they have trampled and
	cleared just below the ridge.  Blue laser fences encircle the
	perimeter.  Inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a
	central campfire.

	The vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents.
	At the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture
	containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they
	have already rounded up.

	SARAH, MALCOLM, and NICK stand at the edge of the ridge above,
	looking down at the scene.  Sarah stands a bit further back
	from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge.
	VOICES waft up to them, raucous, LAUGHING, some even SINGING.

	DR. JUTTSON has a pair of night-vision binoculars trained on
	the cages.

				JUTTSON
		Carinthosaurus -- compsognathus --
		triceratops -- pachycephalosaurus --
		or small scavengers only.

	Malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing
	something below.

	THROUGH MALCOLM'S BINOCULARS,

	he sees PETER LUDLOW, standing in the middle of the camp,
	pointing, giving orders.

	ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm drops the binoculars.

				MALCOLM
		Ludlow.  That's why Hammond was in
		such a hurry for me to get here.  He
		knew they were coming.

	He gives the binoculars to Sarah, who moves forward gingerly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		You okay?

				SARAH
			(irritated)
		Heights, I can't help it.  Put your
		arm here, will you?

	She puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is
	close to the cliff edge.

				JUTTSON
		What do they want?

				MALCOLM
		They want their money back.  To
		InGen, this island is nothing more
		than a bed investment.

				JUTTSON
		We should get back to base camp.
		Eddie's waiting for us.

				MALCOLM
		I can't believe Peter Ludlow's
		running all this.

				SARAH
		He isn't.  Check out the guy walking
		past the fire.

	She hands the binoculars to Malcolm.

	THROUGH THE BINOCULARS,

	Malcolm sees ROLAND, who's walking with AJAY, weapons and
	equipment slung over their shoulders.

				SARAH (o.s.)
		I've seen him before.  In Brazil.  He
		and that guy with him were
		spearhunting jaguars.  Said it was
		immoral to go after them any other
		way.  He's not just a hunter, he's a
		philosopher.  Kind of guy who beats
		you up with your own argument.

	BACK ON THE RIDGE,

				SARAH (cont'd)
		He's the one in charge.

				MALCOLM
		Well, if that's true -- the man in
		charge just left camp.

	Nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps
	forward.

				NICK
		Then this is our chance.

				MALCOLM
		Our chance to do what?

				NICK
		I don't know these guys, but I know
		'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese
		whalers, French barges trying to dump
		barrels of nuclear waste in the North
		Atlantic.  They're all the same.
		They spray us with water cannon when
		we try to stop 'em, sink our boats,
		and then call us crazy.

	He rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools.  A
	hunting knife.  A bolt cutter.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Nobody has to come with me.  I've
		done this before.

				SARAH
		Why, Nick.  You are a tree-hugger.

	He looks at her, hurt.

				NICK
		There' no reason for name calling.

				MALCOLM
		Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back
		to camp right away.  Leave the other
		car for us and we'll meet you there
		in an hour or so.

				KELLY
		What are you guys gonna do?

				MALCOLM
			(signs)
		Exactly what John Hammond wanted us
		to do.

							CUT TO:

	INT. TENT - HUNTER'S CAMP - NIGHT

	In the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve-year-old scotch
	sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition.
	PETER LUDLOW reaches in and pulls a bottle out.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	In the jungle, LUDLOW approaches a small clearing.  ROLAND is
	bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to
	it.  As Ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what
	protest.  Roland looks up.

				ROLAND
		Offering a little incentive.

	Ludlow laughs and shakes his head.  He takes a drink and
	offers Roland one.  Roland accepts.  Ludlow notices Roland's
	gun leaning against a tree.

				LUDLOW
		What kind of gun is that?

				ROLAND
		My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made
		in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to
		him after he took down his last
		elephant.  8700 foot pound striking
		force.

				LUDLOW
		How close do you have to be?

				ROLAND
		Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume
		it'll take a slug in the brain case
		to bring him down.

				LUDLOW
		Why not just use a scope and a poison
		dart and snipe him from a hill?

	Roland just looks at him.

				ROLAND
		Or a laser beam from a satellite?

	Ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it
	while it thrashes on its chain.  Its mouth has been bound shut
	with a leather strap.

				LUDLOW
		You rally think this'll draw the
		parent?

				ROLAND
		I once saw a bull elephant die
		charging a jeep.  All the jeep had
		done was startle the bull's calves.
		I saw a lioness carry wounded prey
		four and a half miles, all the way
		back to its den, just to teach its
		cubs how to finish off a kill.

				LUDLOW
		Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.

				ROLAND
		Rex won't be any different.  It'll
		come.

				LUDLOW
		You're kidding yourself.  An adult
		T-rex cares about one thing --
		filling its own belly.  It acts the
		way people wish they could, that's
		why everyone's fascinated by it.  If
		people had the chance to see one
		dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine
		percent would --

	He stops, an idea on his face.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Wait.  Why not?  Sedatives...
		growth inhibitors...

				ROLAND
		What?

				LUDLOW
		I hadn't planned on bringing
		carnivores back because of the
		liability risk, but I only thought of
		adults, it never occurred to me --
			(close to the animal)
		You are a billion dollar idea, my
		little f-

	CRACK!  The tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut,
	lunges at Ludlow's face, head-butting him right across the
	bridge of the nose.  Ludlow staggers back, WAITING in pain,
	clutching his bleeding face.

	Roland laughs.  Ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up
	Roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's
	leg.  The bone breaks with a dry SNAP and the animal HOWLS in
	pain.

	Roland lunges and throws Ludlow to the ground, but the damage
	is done.

				ROLAND
		What the hell you do that for?!

	As his pain eases, Ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts
	to cover.

				LUDLOW
		Had to.  To keep him still for the
		trip.

				ROLAND
		You've broken its leg!

				LUDLOW
		We've got to transport it seven
		thousand miles.  Would you prefer it
		bit off the leg of a crew member?

	He gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp,
	trying to salvage his dignity.  Roland watches him go.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EDGE OF HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	At the edge of the hunters' camp, NICK, SARAH, and MALCOLM
	scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser
	barriers.  There are three beams, each about two feet apart,
	the tallest almost six feet off the ground.

	Nick reaches the edge and crouches.  Sarah, helped by Malcolm,
	steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a
	CRUNCH.  Nick is next, given a boost by Malcolm, who is then
	left alone on the other side.

	He backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then
	springs off his good leg --

	-- and does the Fosburry Flop right over the top.  He lands
	with a THUD, to the silent admiration of the other two.

	FURTHER IN THE CAMP,

	the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel
	barrels.  They lean around the edge for a look.  They're
	directly behind the row of vehicle.

	They move, into the open, covering the ground between them and
	the jeeps.  Reaching them, Nick hits the dirt and wriggles
	under the first one.  Malcolm and Sarah stand lookout.

	UNDER THE JEEP,

	Nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket.  He squirms
	along until he finds the jeep's fuel line --

	-- and he snips it.  He ducks out of the way just as the
	stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.

	MALCOLM AND SARAH

	move slowly down the line, standing watch as Nick crawls out
	from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second.  They
	hear another SNIP, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves
	to the third.

	From in the distance, Malcolm hears a sound, a faint,
	high-pitched SCREECHING.  He turns and looks to that
	direction.

	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT

	It's the baby T-rex, still SCREENING.  Up in a nearby tree,
	ROLAND and AJAY have spread some broken branches crosswise to
	form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground.

	They wait.

	Roland raises his binoculars.  The light of the camp spills
	all the way out here, illuminating some of the jungle.  He
	scans it, searching for any sign of movement.

	EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	Back in the camp, Sarah, Malcolm, and Nick have finished with
	all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is
	parked some distance away, undergoing repairs.  The motor pool
	area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline.

	The saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the
	drunken revelry.  They pass several tents, the shadows of the
	partiers visible as they move inside.

	They continue across the camp and arrive at the other side --

	-- to face the caged animals.  The carinthosaur that was
	tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and
	glassy, still under the effects.  They pass a stegosaur, its
	row of fine bristling.

	And finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a
	triceratops the size of a pickup truck, Nick pulls out his
	trusty bolt cutters.  He looks at them, a glint in his eye.

				NICK
		Hang on.  We may encounter some
		turbulence.

	INT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT

	In one of the hunter tents, PETER LUDLOW leans over the
	satellite recon pictures of the island, planning the next
	day's assault with DIETER and DR. BURKE, their paleontologist.
	There are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the
	photos, indicating where certain species can be found.

				BURKE
		If you're really interested in
		infants, we'll have better luck at
		the seaside, because the sands offer
		a cushioning surface where the egg
		clutches can -- can --

	He trails off.  A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and
	the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.

	They look at each other.  The RUMBLING gets louder.  Outside,
	someone SHOUTS; on the board, the little dinosaurs start
	hopping and bouncing from the vibrations, the SHOUTS outside
	turn to SCREAMS, they turn and look at the back of the tent --

	-- and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas!

	EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

	HUNTERS go flying as the tent-covered triceratops, its horns
	tearing through the canvas, RUMBLES across the camp.  Men
	SHOUT in alarm, the triceratops BELLOWS in anger and
	confusion, chaos reigns.

	In the crush of PEOPLE running every which way, MALCOLM and
	SARAH are swept off in one direction while NICK is buffeted
	in another.  They SHOUT, but cannot be heard over the frey.

	The triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right
	through the fire in the middle of the camp AND THE TENT BURSTS
	INTO FLAME.

	Now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all
	directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and/or setting
	ablaze anything that gets in its way.  Its considerable
	hindquarters SLAM into a parked jeep, sending it rolling
	across the camp.

	The jeep flattens the largest tent and SLAMS down on its side.
	Its broken gas line SPRAYS gas over the ground, the gas hits
	one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in
	its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas.

	The jeep explodes.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE CLEARING,

	Roland and Ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a
	fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.

				ROLAND
		What in God's -- !

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	the rest of the newly-freed animals now storm through the
	camp.  The blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as
	the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing
	animals.

	AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP,

	Nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the
	bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one
	direction, while Malcolm and Sarah vanish in the other.

	The burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates
	in a series of smaller EXPLOSIONS.

	Dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the
	series of concessive blasts.  He drags himself up onto all
	fours, charred and bruised.  A burning tire rolls slowly past
	him, spinning to a stop --

	-- at ROLAND's feet.  Dieter looks up at him.

				ROLAND
		Last time I leave you in charge.

	OUT IN THE JUNGLE,

	Nick breaks out into the jungle clearing, the same one where
	Ajay and Roland had their blind.  He sees the baby tyrannosaur
	chained to the stake.

				NICK
		Sick bastards.

	He goes to the animal, which now BLEATS in pain, its broken
	leg hanging at an odd angle.  With one strong tug, Nick pulls
	the stake out of the ground.

	BACK IN THE CAMP,

	Roland surveys the destruction.  The fire has spread and
	several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air,
	the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are
	scattered and terrified.  PETER LUDLOW, breathless, face
	smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to Roland.

				LUDLOW
		What in Christ's name is going on?!

				ROLAND
		Isn't it obvious?

	He holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages.

				NICK (cont'd)
		We're not alone on this island.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	MALCOLM and SARAH race back up onto the ridge trail, where the
	green AAV is parked.  NICK bursts around from the other side
	of the car.

				SARAH
		Nick, thank God, we didn't know
		if --

	Malcolm opens the rear door.

				NICK
		Wait, don't ---

	With a piercing SHRIEK, the BABY TYRANNOSAUR, now in the back
	of the AAV, flings itself at the open doorway, jaws SNAPPING
	just short of Malcolm's nose.

				MALCOLM
		HOLY SHIT!!

	He SLAMS the door.

	DOWN IN THE HUNTERS' CAMP,

	Roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up.

				ROLAND
		Do we have anyone up there?

	BACK UP ON THE RIDGE,

	Malcolm is confronting Nick.

				MALCOLM
		?!

 NICK 		It has a broken leg!

 MALCOLM 		So do it a favor and put it out of
		its misery!

 NICK 		No!  Get in the car before they hear 
		us!

	He runs around and leaps in the driver's seat.  Sarah slips
	into the passenger seat, quickly, leaving Malcolm no choice
	but the rear.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	The AAV SLAPS through the jungle foliage.  From inside the
	car, we can hear the baby tyrannosaur SCREAMING in anger.

 INT. AAV - NIGHT 
	The baby writhes on the base seat next to Malcolm, who has
	flattened himself against the door, as far away from the
	animal as possible.

 SARAH 		Ian, close the window, it's going to
		wake every predator in the jungle!

	Malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its
	window.  The tyrannosaur SLASHES with one of its powerful hind
	legs, ripping the flesh of his forearm.  He SHOUTS in pain.

	Outside, the listening jungle whizzes by.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Up in the high hide, EDDIE, DR. JUTTSON, and KELLY are
	standing watch, scanning the jungle for any sign of their
	returning comrades.

	Juttson yanks the night-vision binoculars away from his face
	as he spots the AAV, pulling up to the base camp a couple
	hundred yards away.

 JUTTSON 		There they are!

	They all turn and look, but Eddie furrows his brow, watching
	them pull the wounded animal from the back seat.

 EDDIE 		What is that they have with them?

 EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their
	arms, headed for the trailer.  MALCOLM, holding his bleeding
	arm, isn't far behind.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	SARAH and NICK bring the SCREAMING infant to the metal dining
	table and hold it down.  MALCOLM is right behind them.

 MALCOLM 		This is exceedingly unwise.

	Sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a
	small syringe.  Her shirt is streaked with blood from the
	baby's injured leg.

 SARAH 		Too late to worry about that!  Hold
		him together, Nick!

	Nick tightens his grip on the animal and Sarah makes an
	injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.

 MALCOLM 		Just do whatever you have to do and
		get it out of here as quickly as
		possible.

	Sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over
	the animal's leg.  A green and white skeletal image appears on
	a monitor next to the table.

 SARAH 		Okay, there's the metatarsals --
		tibia, fibula -- there it is!  See
		it?  That's a fracture, just above
		the epiphysis.

	They peer closely at the monitor.

 NICK 		That little black line?

 SARAH 		That little black line means death
		for this infant.  The fibula won't
		heal straight, so the ankle joint
		can't pivot when he stands on his
		hind feet.  The baby won't be able to
		run, and probably can't even walk.
		It'll be crippled, and a predator
		will pick it off before it gets more
		than a few weeks old.

 MALCOLM 		Can you set up?

 SARAH 			(thinking)
		It has to be temporary, something
		that'll break apart and fall off as
		the animal grows...

 MALCOLM 		Think fast, Sarah.

	The tyrannosaur, still in pain, SHRIEKS again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Through their binoculars, the rest of the group watches the
	trailer carefully.  Even inside, the animal's SCREECHES are
	clearly audible.  Kelly is getting scared.

 KELLY 		What are they doing?  Why don't
		they hurry?!

 EDDIE 		Give me the radio.

	From the trailer, the baby lets out a long, plaintive
 SHRIEK -- 
	One by one, Eddie, Kelly, and Juttson turn around and stare
	into the night jungle.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	NICK holds the animal while SARAH fits an aluminum foil cuff
	around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin.
	MALCOLM, at the window, stares out anxiously.  The animal
	thrashes again.

 NICK 		Give it more morphine!

 SARAH 		We'll kill it with too much, we'll
		put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm
		almost done.  Damn it, I need
		another adhesive, something pliable I
		can --

	Her eyes fall on Nick.  She holds out her hand, urgently.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		Spit!

	He spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand.  The baby
	rex CRIES OUT again.

 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	From the swaying jungle, there is another answering ROAR.

	And this one's closer.

	In the high hide, the rest of the group stares, trembling.  In
	the distance, a flock of birds SHRIEKS and takes flight as the
	tops of some trees move, a whole section of forest suddenly
	coming alive, as if brushed by wind.

	But it's not the wind.

	They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.  And then another
	section of forest trembles.  Closer.  Another flock of birds
	bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide.

 KELLY 		What is it?

	Dr. Juttson puts an arm around Kelly, instinctively pulling
	her closer to him.  Eddie WHISPERS urgently into the
	walkie-talkie.

 EDDIE 		Sarah, come in!

 JUTTSON 		It's moving.  Fast.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	There is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer.
	The speaker BUZZES urgently with Eddie's VOICE.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Sarah, Malcolm, can you hear me?!

	On the table, Sarah is frantically molding Nick's bubblegum
	into place on the makeshift splint.  But the baby rex,
	regaining its strength, is thrashing again.

 SARAH 		Hold it down, Nick!

 NICK 		I'm trying!

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(from the radio)
		Is anybody there?!

	Malcolm moves to answer the radio, but Sarah SHOUTS to him.

 SARAH 		Ian, get the bottle of amoxicillin
		and fill a syringe!  Quick injection
		of antibiotics and I can get it out
		of here!

	Forsaking the radio, Malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and
	comes up with what she wants.  Working fast, he draws twenty
	cc's of the pink liquid.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
			(still from the radio, now
			 desperate)
 SARAH OR IAN, ANSWER ME! 
	They ignore him as Sarah grabs the syringe and makes the
	injection.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
 WHATEVER YOU BROUGHT INTO THE TRAILER, GET IT OUT NOW! 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	Eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio
	desperately.

 EDDIE WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION! I REPEAT -- 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Nick, Sarah, and Malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible
	piece of information.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, Christ.

	He bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Let me talk to Kelly, is she--

	A deafening ROAR sound from just outside the trailer,
	followed immediately by a CRASHING sound.  They whirl and look
	to the window, just in time to see --

	--  the AAV tumbling by, rolling on its side!

	There is another ROAR, and the baby, on the table, ROARS in
	response.  Outside the window, the head of a full-grown
	TYRANNOSAURUS REX lowers and peers inside.

	Malcolm, Sarah, and Nick all freeze in absolute terror.

	The rex outside GURGLES, making material cooing noises.  The
	baby rex, calm for the first time, GURGLES back.

	But across the trailer, in the opposite window, ANOTHER T-REX
 HEAD SUDDENLY APPEARS. 
	This one ROARS, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles
	anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.

 NICK 		What do they want?!

 MALCOLM 		What do you think they want?!

 SARAH 		That's impossible, they can't have
		the sensory equipment to track it all
		the way here!

 MALCOLM 		Current evidence seems to be to the
		contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT
 TO THEM! 
	Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used
	earlier.  He whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it
	into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, SLAMS a
	fresh cassette in, and flicks the "ON" switch.

	Sarah and Malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the
	trailer, carrying the baby rex.  Outside, the two adult rexes
	stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them
	through the window.

 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly
	illuminates Sarah and Malcolm as they carry the bay rex.  The
	adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly
	as long.  They walk slowly alongside it, hunched over,
	watching their infant.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	At the door to the trailer, Sarah un-muzzles the frantic baby.

 SARAH 		Ready?

	Malcolm reaches for the door handle.

 NICK 		Wait!

	He dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video
	camera up at the door, getting the best shot.  Malcolm takes a
	breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door.

	Outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring,
	surprised.

	Although terrified, Sarah actually starts to sing.

 SARAH 			(softly)
		Born free, as free as the wind blows.
		As free as the grass grows --

 MALCOLM 		Are you insane?!

 SARAH 		I swear to God, it works with lions
		sometimes!  There we are -- your baby
		is free --

	The baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the
	ground outside.  Not wasting a second, Malcolm SLAMS the door
	shut.

	The three of them freeze, not daring to breath.  Outside, they
	can hear the SNUFFLING and COOING of the animals as they
	inspect their young --

	-- and then the soft THUD of their footsteps, growing fainter
	as they move away.

	From the wall, EDDIE'S VOICE comes over the radio, relieved.

 EDDIE 		They're going back into the jungle.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HIGH HIDE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE, JUTTSON, and KELLY sag back against the railings of the
	high hide.

 EDDIE 		Thank God.  Thank God.

	MALCOLM'S VOICE comes over the radio.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		Kelly?  Are you all right?

	She takes the radio, her voice shaky.

 KELLY 		Uh huh.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM is at the radio.

 MALCOLM 		Wait there.  I'll come up in a
		minute.  Don't move, understand?

				KELLY (o.s.)
		I understand.

	Malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer.  SARAH and
	NICK sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall,
	completely drained.  Sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and
	speaks shakily into it.

 SARAH 		Note to Dr. Juttson -- Tyrannosaurus
		rex does nurture its young.

	They laugh weakly.

 NICK 		There's, uh -- there's an unwritten
		rule when a news crew is in a war
		zone.  You stop the van every two
		miles and decide whether or not to go
		on.  Whether or not you feel lucky.
		One "no" from anybody in the group
		and you turn around right there, no
		question asked, nobody embarrassed.
			(pause)
		Well?  Do we go on?
	Immediately:

 SARAH 		No.

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		No way.

	They all laugh.

 MALCOLM 		All right.  I'm satisfied with the
		evidence we have right now.
		I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will
		too.
			(to Sarah)
		Do you have enough to publish?

 SARAH 		They will come after me.  But I can
		collect some stool samples, for DNA
		with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest
		of you to back me up, it should stand
		when we get back.

 MALCOLM 			(getting up)
		Then the only thing left to do is
		make sure we do get back.  I'll
		call the mainland on the satellite
		phone and have them send the boat
		right now.  This expedition is over.

	He goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite
	phone that's resting in a battery pack.  The front panel
	lights up, a brilliant green.

	But from the wall speaker, the radio CRACKLES and EDDIE'S
	VOICE breaks through, soft and empty.

				EDDIE (o.s.)
		Oh, God.  I am so sorry.

	Malcolm and Sarah look at the speaker box.

 MALCOLM 		What the hell is he sorry f-

	A low RATTLE sneaks into the trailer.  Malcolm, Sarah, and
	Nick takes a step forward from the walls, looking around.  The
	RATTLE gets louder, the trailer shakes and vibrates,
	everything in it starts to BANG against the walls --

	-- and something huge SMASHES into the side of the trailer.

	They're all thrown against the far wall, there is an
	earsplitting CRACK of electricity, the entire trailer rocks
	and sparks a brilliant blue, and then everything goes black.

	The satellite phone flies out of Malcolm's hands and SMACKS
	against the wall.  It lands on the floor, its number pad still
	glowing green.

	Nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows.  Outside,
	the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window,
	revealing the second tyrannosaur, charging straight at the
	trailer!

 NICK HANG ON TO SOMETHING! 
	They hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on
	for dear life.  The charging rex SLAM into the side of the
	trailer, which rocks up on one side, BANGS back  down, and is
	quickly RAMMED again by the furious animal.  This time the
	entire trailer rolls over, completely upside down.

	Sarah, Nick, and Malcolm let go of their precarious handholds
	and drop onto the ceiling.  The tables, chairs, lab equipment,
	everything that's bolted down clings to the floor above them;
	everything that isn't RAINS DOWN ON THEM.

	But the rexes aren't done.  The trailer JOLTS INTO MOTION,
	sliding forwards.

 SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, 
	the upside down trailer, which is the rear of the two
	trailers, slides along the muddy ground, pushing up earth in
	front of it.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
 SARAH 		They're pushing us!

	Malcolm, frantic, crawls up to a window to get a look outside.
	He looks down and sees a T-rex footprint in the earth outside
	as they move past it.

	He cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which
	they are being pushed.  His eyes widen at something he sees
	outside the window.

 MALCOLM 		Oh, God.

 SARAH 		What?!

 MALCOLM 		They're pushing us over the cliff.

	Sure enough, out the back window, we see a few more feet of
	muddy earth, and then nothing but inky black.  The three of
	them look at each other for a moment --

	-- and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the
	trailer.  The opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and
	starts up to tip ever-so-slightly downward.  They reach the
	accordion-like connector and Malcolm crawls into it.

 THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THE FRONT TRAILER, 
	which is right-side-up, Malcolm can see the two rexes hard at
	it, pushing the front end of the trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer, but
	Sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff
	starts to roll and tumble past her, headed downhill.

	The angle increases, the trailer dips, and now stuff starts to
	freefall, right past her, some SMASHING her in the head.

	Malcolm, still in the connecting tube, grabs hold.  Sarah,
	starting to be pulled downward, paws at the refrigerator,
	getting a g rip on the handle.  The door, held by a safety
	latch, doesn't open.

	Below Sarah, debris falls to the rear window of the trailer.
	Through the CRACKING glass, we can see the surf, CRASHING five
	hundred feet below.

	The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.  The
	box strains on its power cord.

	Still clinging to the handle, Sarah swings wildly as it starts
	to come loose, swaying above her.

	The safety latch on the door gives, it swings open, and a
	shower of food BANGS off of her as gravity empties the
	contents.

	Sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now-vertical
	trailer.  She SCREAMS, covers her head, and SMASHES into the
	rear window.  The glass spiderwebs, but does not break.

 FIVE HUNDRED FEET BELOW, 
	an enormous wave POUNDS the rocky shore.  Above, Sarah is a
	tiny figure, sprawled out on the glass, held invisibly by the
	breaking window.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Nick SHOUTS to her.

 NICK SARAH! DON'T MOVE! 
	Sarah, stunned by the fall, blinks a few times, regaining her
	senses.  She looks down, at the crashing surf so far below.
	For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.  As
	she stares, the rocks seem to move even farther away from her.
	She blanches; the world spins around her.

 SARAH 		OH... GOD ... please...

	Her breath fogs the cracked glass.  Slowly, she tries to get
	up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.

	But as she puts pressures on her hands, the glass CRACKS even
	more, tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers.  The
	whole glass panel sags, bowing out around the bottom of the
	trailer.

 UP ABOVE HER, 
	Malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously
	balanced on one leg of the kitchen table, its number pad still
	glowing green.  Nick is closest to it.

 MALCOLM 		Nick!  Grab the phone!

 SARAH 
	looks to her right, at a metal grating that runs along the
	wall of the trailer.  She shifts her weight, leaning on one
	hand to reach for the grating with the other.

 NICK 
	reaches for the satellite phone, its antenna just six inches
	from his outstretched fingers.

 SARAH 
	leans toward the metal grating, all hairline cracks shoot out
	around her pivot hand, shaking through the glass.  The
	splintered glass spread like a disease, it reaches the edge
	of the frame --

	-- and her hand CRACKS right through the glass.  She GASPS and
	pulls her hand out, but now she knees SMASH through the
	glass.

 NICK 
	has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer
	shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.

 NICK SARAH LOOK OUT! 
 SARAH 
	lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the
	heavy phone whizzes past her head and SMASHES into the glass,
	opening up a huge hole in the center of the back window.

 UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, 
	glass, food, lab equipment, and the precious satellite phone
	fall out the broken window and SMASH on the rocks far below.

 IN THE CLEANING, 
	the trailers are split, like an L, the rear trailer hanging
	straight down, the forward one resting on the edge of the
	cliff.  Satisfied with their work, the T-rexes turn and lumber
	back into the jungle.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating.  Above her, Nick
	lowers himself as far as he can, reaching for her.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one
	corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows
	out from the muddy cliff.

	But now those branches SPLINTER.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm sees the bellows, the connector between the trailers,
	stretch as the lower trailer JERKS and dips lower.

 BELOW HIM, 
	Sarah mountain-climbs through the trailer's kitchen,
	inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for
	purchase.

 OUTSIDE, 
	the tree branch SNAPS and the trailer jerks, stretching down
	again.  The bellows expands to its full length, stretching
	like a Slinky.

 INSIDE, 
	Nick knows he has to hurry.  He climbs down, bouncing off the
	built-in furniture, moving ever closer to Sarah.

	But Sarah slips and loses her grip, dropping a few feet.  She
	gabs hold of the sink, the flowing water spraying her face.

 EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT 
	EDDIE CARR is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through
	the jungle as fast as he can.

 EDDIE 		Hang on -- hang on --

	The foliage SMACKS the windshield, then clears suddenly,
	revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of
	him.  The jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the
	rex and SKIDS to a halt.

 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
	Sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, SMASHING into the
	frame of the half-broken rear window again.

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer.  He
	SHOUTS in through the broken front window.

 EDDIE HEY! HELLO?! 
 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	The three look up from their precarious positions.

 MALCOLM WE'RE IN HERE! GET SOME ROPE! 
 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie turns and run back to the jeep.  He grabs a coil of
	rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the
	trailer.

 IN THE REAR TRAILER, 
	Eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out
	into the extended connector.  He peers over the edge, down
	into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.

 EDDIE 		Catch!

	The rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end
	dangling all the way out the smashed rear window.  But the
	trailer SHUDDERS, starting to move again.

 SARAH 		We're sliding!

 EDDIE 		Climbs up if you can!

 OUTSIDE, 
	Eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels
	dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling
	trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff.

	He runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the
	front grill.

	Behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff.

	Eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable
	behind him.  He runs up to the still-moving trailer, dives for
	its towing hook, the cable goes taut --

	-- and he falls short.  Just by six inches, but he's out of
	cable.

 EDDIE 		Damn it!

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick and Sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the
	bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them.  Malcolm is
	further up, also clinging to the rope.

 OUTSIDE, 
	dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the
	edge of the cliff.

	Eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable.  He turns
	and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to LIFT
 THE FRONT END OFF THE GROUND! 
	Eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook CLICKS
	securely into the trailer's towing hook.  The trailer lurches
	toward the edge of the cliff and stops.

	But the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure.

 IN THE TRAILER, 
	Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while
	Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks
	them back, and their hands slide down the line.  SCREAMING,
	they slide through the trailer and their feet SMASH through
	the remains of the rear window.

	Regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them
	now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer,
	dangling over the rocky shore below.

 IN THE JEEP, 
	Eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to
	get a grip.  The jeep pulls just enough to lower the front
	trailer back to earth.  But the tires spin, fighting to hold
	it there.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE 
	Sarah and Nick dangle, desperate.

 IN THE JEEP 
	Eddie CHUNKS the shifter into four wheel drive and GUNS the
	engine.  As the motor ROARS, the sound is topped by another
	ROAR, in the distance.

	And this one's not a machine.  But Eddie doesn't hear it.  He
	GUNS the engine again.  There is another ROAR from the jungle.

	Eddie hears this one.  He darts a look at the side view
	mirror.  In it, he sees one of the TYRANNOSAURS bolt out of
	the jungle behind him.

	He GASPS and looks at the other side view.  In it, he sees the
	OTHER REX racing toward him.

	The tyrannosaurs STOMP forward to confront the ROARING jeep.
	The first rex bends over, CHOMPS down on the rear tire, and
	lifts the car to its teeth.

	But the spinning tire LINGS in the rex's mouth, burning it.
	Surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and
	the jeep BANGS back down onto the ground.

	Eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get
	away.  The gas pedal pops up --

	-- which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff.

	But the rex STOMPS down on the jeep to prevent its escape.
	The trailers stop.

	Now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on Eddie,
	who still covers under the steering wheel.  The first rex
	SNAPS at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving Eddie fully
	exposed.

	He SCREAMS and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its
	teeth and tossing him out of the car.

	Eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their
	heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split-second, he
	disappears between their teeth.

	Now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the
	trailers drop over the edge of the cliff.

 INSIDE THE TRAILER, 
	Nick, Sarah and Malcolm cling to each other and the rope as
	the trailers fall around them.  The windows flash by as the
	trailers plummet, equipment BANGS and SCRAPES them, but they
	hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life.

 ON THE CLIFFSIDE, 
	the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three,
	who pop out the space where the front windshield was.
	Dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which
	is now rolling to the edge of the cliff.

	It falls, past them, and the whole mess EXPLODES on the rocks
	below.  Finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the
	surf.

 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
	It's quiet up here too, the rexes nowhere to be seen.  At the
	cliff, a hand appears from over the edge.  Then another.
	SARAH pulls herself up, back onto solid ground, then comes
	NICK, then both of them reach over and help MALCOLM up over
	the edge.

	They collapse there, in the mud, completely exhausted.

 MALCOLM 			(softly)
		Eddie?

	He looks at the other two.  They glance around, then drop
	their heads.  Sarah hears a SOUND in the distance.

 SARAH 		Oh, God.  Now what?

	From the edge of the jungle, a cris-cross of flashlight beams
	moves toward them.  But rather than the three or four that
	would signify their own group, there are nearly twenty of
	them.

	The HUNTERS, PETER LUDLOW is in the lead, ROLAND and AJAY
	with him.  DIETER is there too, shepherding KELLY and DR.
	JUTTSON along in front of him.

	Malcolm sees Kelly, they call out to each other, and race
	together.  Malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly
	as he possibly can.

 MALCOLM 		Are you all right?!  Anything broken?

 KELLY 		I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I
		thought you, are you okay?!

 MALCOLM 		I'm fine... I'm fine...

	Roland looks around, at the mess that was their base camp.

 ROLAND 			(mostly to himself)
		That's what you think.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED BASE CAMP - NIGHT 
	In the ruins of the first team's base camp, the survivors of
	the night's two separate catastrophes stand face to face, in a
	heated argument.

	MALCOLM sits off to the side, still holding Kelly in his arms,
	just looking down at the ground and shaking his head.  There's
	something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous
	than any of the hot tempers that are flaring.  LUDLOW rants to
	SARAH while DIETER looms menacingly over NICK.

 LUDLOW 		Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go
		to jail just for being here, did
		you know that?

 SARAH 		Don't start a legal argument with me,
		this island isn't your property, and
		neither are these animals!

	DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE.

 JUTTSON 		What are you doing here, Burke?
		There's no TV cameras, what's the
		point?

 BURKE 		Dr. Juttson, you exist outside the
		classroom.  I am amazed.

	Dieter continues to get in Nick's face.

 NICK 		Are you looking for a problem?

 JUTTSON 			(an urgent whisper)
		Everyone, keep your voices down!

 ROLAND 		Back off, Dieter.

 JUTTSON 		Listen to me, by moving the baby
		rex into our camp, we changed the
		adults' perceived territory!

 LUDLOW 		Their what?

 SARAH 			(she understands)
		Oh, God.

 JUTTSON 		That's why they persisted in
		destroying the trailers, they now
		feel they have to defend this entire
		area!  We're not safe here.

 LUDLOW 			(of Sarah and Nick)
		Thanks to you people.

 SARAH 		Hey, we came here to observe, you
		came here to strip-mine the place!
		It's a looter mentality, all you care
		about is what you can take.

 ROLAND 		None of that matters.  Our
		communications equipment's been
		destroyed.  If your radio and
		satellite phone were in those
		trailers that went off the cliff, and
		I'm guessing by the look on his
		face --

	He points at Malcolm, who is still off to the side, sitting in
	stunned silence.  Malcolm looks up and nods, slowly.  The
	grimness of their situation sinks in.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		We are stuck here, ladies and
		gentlemen.  And we're stuck together.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. HUNTERS' CAMP - NIGHT 
	Back in the hunters' now-demolished camp, members of the two
	groups combine their diminished supplies.  They have half a
	dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty-seven
	containers of food, ranging from Ziploc bags to aluminum tins,
	a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or
	shoulders of the HUNTER team, the charred and scraggly
	remnants of several pieces of now-useless electrical
	equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered
	paperback ("Crime and Punishment"), a box of Hershey bars, and
	a cartoon of Marlboros.

	ROLAND supervises the assembling of the resources, which are
	displayed in front of him.  LUDLOW, NICK, SARAH, JUTTSON, and
	MALCOLM, who is still holding KELLY close to him, are with
	him.  They hold their discussion in quiet tones.

 ROLAND 		If we can't stay in the rex's
		territory, we have to move tonight.

 SARAH 		Move where?  Our boat's not coming
		for two days, your airlift is waiting
		for an order you have no way to
		send --

	Ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite
	photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.

 LUDLOW 		There's a communication center, here,
		in the old worker village.  Hammond
		put in some kind of renewable power
		source replenishing.  It may still
		work.  If we could get there, we
		could send a radio call for the
		airlift.

 NICK 		How far is the village?

 LUDLOW 		I said if we could get there.

 NICK 		Well, how far is it?

 LUDLOW 		A day's walk, maybe more.  That's not
		the problem.

 ROLAND 		What is?

 LUDLOW 		The velociraptors.

	Malcolm looks up sharply.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		Our infrareds show their nesting
		sites are concentrated in the island
		interior.  That's why we planned on
		keeping to the outer rim.

	Malcolm shepherds Kelly away from the conversation and mutters
	something to her quietly in the background.

 DIETER 		What are velociraptors?

 JUTTSON 		Carnivores.  Pack hunters.  About six
		feet long, three or four hundred
		pounds, and very, very fast.

	Dieter brandishes his weapon.

 DIETER 		I think we can handle ourselves
		against them.

	Malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone.  He keeps his voice
	low.

 MALCOLM 		No.  I'm quite certain you can't.

 ROLAND 		Look, we have two choices.  We can
		hike back down to the lagoon, where
		we can sit for two days, in the open,
		next to a heavily used water source
		while we're waiting for your boat to
		arrive, or we can head for the
		village, where we might find some
		shelter and we can call for help.

 MALCOLM 		We'd never make it past the raptors.
		Trust me, I have some experience in
		this matter.

	Roland looks at him.

 ROLAND 		That may be.  But you weren't with
		me at the time.

	Malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to
	Kelly.  Roland turns to the others.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Load up.  Let's get this moveable
		feast underway.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT 
	The SURVIVORS set forth, marching through the jungle in a
	column.  Two HUNTERS strap on small shoulder-mounted
	servo-flashlights.  Wires run from the lights end in
	sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks.  Thus
	attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo-lights
	turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in.

	MALCOLM screws the barrel into the Lindstradt rifle and slings
	it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily.  He looks
	down at KELLY, who is marching alongside him.  His face shows
	the deepest of regret.  He shakes his head, cursing himself.

 MALCOLM 		Damn it.

	He looks away as Kelly looks up at him, questioning.  ROLAND
	falls into step with Malcolm and notices his limp.

 ROLAND 		You all right?

	Malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
		Wrong question?

 MALCOLM 		You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?

 ROLAND 		What's that?

 MALCOLM 		A statistical phenomenon.  Says
		everything in the world goes in
		streaks.  It's real, you see it
		everywhere -- in weather, in river
		flooding, in baseball, in blackjack,
		in stock markets.  Once things go
		bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad
		things cluster.  They go to hell
		together.

 ROLAND 		Feeling a bit blue, are we?

	Malcolm glances at Kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace
	and is a few steps ahead of them now.

 MALCOLM 		Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.

 ROLAND 		Why did you come here?

 MALCOLM 		So that others would know about this
		place?

 ROLAND 		Why should they?

 MALCOLM 		Because it exists.

 ROLAND 		It'll still exit if they go on not
		knowing, won't it?

 MALCOLM 		Yes.  And people will live in the
		absence of truth.

 ROLAND 		So the truth is more important to you
		than your life?

 MALCOLM 			(lowers is voice)
		I don't care about my life.  But if
		I'd ever thought for a second that
		she would be in danger --

	Roland follows his gaze forward, to Kelly, who's about ten
	yards ahead now.

 ROLAND 		She yours?

 AHEAD OF THEM, 
	Kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear.  They are not
	as far away as they think they are.

				MALCOLM (o.s.)
		I'm afraid so.  I don't know what the
		hell I'm doing with kids.  I never
		should have had her.

	Kelly's face shows she heard that part.

 BEHIND HER, 
	Malcolm, unaware, continues with Roland.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Why are you here?

 ROLAND 		Somewhere on this island, there
		exits the greatest predator that
		ever lived.  And the second greatest
		predator must take him down.

 MALCOLM 		But why?

 ROLAND 		You remember that guy, about twenty
		years ago, I forget his name, but he
		climbed Everest without any oxygen,
		came down almost dead.  And they
		asked him, "why did you go up there
		to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I
		went up there to live."

 MALCOLM 			(nods)
		It's called self-testing.  But in
		your case, it sounds more like
		self-destruction.  A uniquely human
		characteristic.  In fact, human
		beings destroy things so well that I
		sometimes think that's our function.
		Maybe every few sons, some animal
		comes along that kills off the rest
		of the world, clears the decks, and
		lets evolution proceed to his next
		phase.  Maybe death and destruction
		are our job, maybe we're supposed
		to destroy ourselves and every other
		living thing that-

	Every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
	staring at Malcolm, shaken by his words.  Roland grabs Malcolm
	by the shirt collar and pulls him close, GROWLING in his ear.

 ROLAND 		Tell you what.  You can see whatever
		you want to, to me, but you will not
		spew any more nihilist rants at
		anyone else in the group.  I'm
		fighting panic, and you push the
		wrong buttons.  Understand?

	Malcolm just blinks.  This guy's in charge.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAWN 
	As a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the SURVIVORS
	stagger on, exhausted.  Some are starting to tire, and there
	are spaces in the column.  MALCOLM's limp seems to be getting
	worse.  NICK reaches out, to take Malcolm's pack, but Malcolm
	swats his hand away.

	KELLY, still ahead of him, falls into step with SARAH.

 KELLY 		I don't think -- my dad doesn't
		think we're going to make it.

	Sarah looks at her.

 SARAH 		Your dad is wrong.  About a lot more
		than he knows.

	She puts an arm around her.  Kelly looks up at her, grateful.
	The long march continues.

 UP AT THE FRONT, 
	NICK catches up to ROLAND.

 NICK 		I think you should call a break.

 ROLAND 		Another half hour.

 NICK 		Some of them won't make another half
		hour.  We didn't come this far to
		start dropping in the middle of the
		jungle.  If you don't call it, I
		will.

	Roland looks at him, steely, then SHOUTS to the group.

 ROLAND FIVE MINUTES BREAK! 
	Immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely
	drained.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DRS. BURKE and JUTTSON are bickering.

 JUTTSON 		I can't believe you're still angry
		about that.

 BURKE 		You know, it's very easy to criticize
		the first person who studies
		something.

 JUTTSON 		No, it's easy to criticize sloppy
		research and hasty conclusions.

 NEARBY, 
	MALCOLM checks Nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're
	still dry and undamaged.  Sarah comes up, watching him.

 SARAH 		You know, even if we do get those
		tapes back, people are going to say
		it's just another hoax.  Ian
		Malcolm's alien autopsy.

 MALCOLM 		Maybe.  Maybe not.

 SARAH 		Ian, they will misplace our evidence,
		shoot holes in our testimony, and say
		some special effects genius created
		the animals.  The only way people
		will ever believe that dinosaurs
		exist is if you dump a T-rex in the
		middle of times Square.

	He doesn't look at her.  She sits down beside her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		There's something more important that
		you should be thinking about instead.

 BEHIND THEM, 
	Dr. Burke, furious, has stalked away from Juttson and sits
	down on a rock.  H does a double take, noticing something
	behind the rock.  He leans over and picks it up.

	It's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled
	exterior.  A dinosaur egg.

	Burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces
	the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder.

 AT THE REAR OF THE GROUP, 
	DIETER STARK pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops
	the pack on the ground, and turns to the Hunter nearest him --
	CARTER, his driver, who has his back turned.

 DIETER 		Wait here for me, would ya Carter?

	He steps off the path, into the jungle.  But as we come around
	the front of Carter, we see he's wearing a Walkman, the
	headphone BLARING tinnily in his ears.

	And he didn't hear a word.

 EXT. THICK OF THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	Only a few feet off the path, it's primary forest, the growth
	so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured.  DIETER claws
	forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself.

	He clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his
	hand to his belt buckle.  He freezes, hearing something we
	didn't.  He glances around, head darting, alert to any danger.

	Nothing there.  Just a few distant ANIMAL CALLS--

	-- and s SCURRYING around to his left.

	Dieter snaps his head in that direction.  At first, he sees
	nothing, but as he moves closer, gun extended in front of him,
	he sees a small dinosaur, a COMPSOGRATHUS, the same
	chicken-sized animal Cathy saw on the beach so long ago.

 DIETER 		It's not polite to --

	He pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches
	it to the compy's back.  The blue bolt of electricity CRACKS
	and dances over the compy's body and it convulses in pain.

				DIETER (cont'd)
		-- sneak up on people.

	The wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle,
	whimpering.  Dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve
	paces, pushes aside two large palm fronds, and steps out
	into --

	-- more jungle.  He stops, puzzled, not sure if he went back
	or forward.

	He looks behind him.  He pauses, recalculating the path he
	took coming into the jungle, MUTTERING to himself, gesturing
	with his hands, retracing his steps.

	He adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in
	that direction.  But after five or six hard-fought steps, he
	stops again.  Still nothing but jungle.

 DIETER HEY! CARTER! YELL OR SOMETHING, I GOT TURNED AROUND IN HERE! 
 ON THE TRAIL, 
	Dieter's cries are faint, but audible.  The only Marchers hear
	enough to hear him is CARTER, but the Walkman is blaring in
	his ears.

				DIETER (o.s.)
		...Carter... me?...

 IN THE JUNGLE, 
	Dieter hears that SCURRYING sound again, this time from his
	right.  He adjusts his angle again and SCRAPES through the
	foliage, moving faster and faster.

	Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the
	ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on
	his face.

	He looks up.  The SCURRYING sound comes again, this time ten
	times louder than before, like a hundred feet coming at him.

	Dieter GASPS as something rushes in at him.

	He whirls to his right.  Whatever it is rushes in from that
	side as well.  And the left.  And behind him.  Dieter
	scrambles up into a sitting position --

	-- and laughs.  He is surrounded by at least forty compys now,
	the same as the one he wounded.

	For a long moment, they just stare at him.  Slowly, he brings
	his gun around, to point it at them.

 DIETER 		Easy -- wait -- one more sec-

	As one, the compys SHRIEK and hurl themselves forward,
	covering Dieter's body.  Their teeth and claws FLASH as they
	each try to grab a scrap of his flesh, tearing savagely.

	Dieter SCREAMS and flails, waving his arms and legs wildly.
	Some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off,
	SMASHING into trees or the ground.  But dozens of others hang
	on, and Dieter falls over backwards, now lying on his back on
	the ground.

	Hysterical, he fights like hell to get to his feet, SCREAMING,
	shaking, swatting the compys loose.  He spins, and that tactic
	seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and
	drop off of him.  But he also loses his grip on his weapon,
	which goes flying, landing in the thick foliage five or six
	feet from him.

	Losing the attack, the compys turn and dart away en masse,
	stopping ten yards away from him.

	But they turn and regroup, facing him in a line, hopping up
	and down, CHIRPING and SHRIEKING.

	Dieter bounds into the foliage, looking for his gun.  But the
	compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his
	lost weapon.

	Ten feet on, he stops, knowing he's screwed without the gun.
	He turns to face the pursuing compys.

	They stop.

	Dieter charges them, SHOUTING, waving his arms.

	The compys turn and run.  Dieter stops.

	The compys stop.  They stare back at him.  There is a moment
	of quiet, then they start to hop again, CHIRPING and
 SQUEALING. 
	Dieter, tired of this game, turns and runs away.

	The compys follow.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	From the front of the convoy, ROLAND SHOUTS out.

 ROLAND 		Break's over, move on!

	The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and
	start to march again.  At the rear of the group, someone taps
	Carter, who is still listening to his music.  Carter gets up,
	hoists his backpack, and marches away.

	Behind him, Dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle
	trail.

 EXT. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE - DAY 
	DIETER stumbles along, exhausted.  He reaches the edge of a
	stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the
	stones.  He falls, into the rocky stream.

	Behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he
	just crested.  They disappear for a moment, down an incline --

	-- And then swarm over his body.  In a frenzy of splashing,
	Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
	He gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log.  A
	geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as
	Dieter drops out of sight.

	The compys leap over the log and disappear from view too,
	throwing up their own splashes of water.  SCREECHING,
	CHIRPING, and the sound of TEARING flesh mixes with Dieter's
 SCREAMS. 
	Now, as more compys leap over the log and splash into the
	water below, the geysers that shoot up into our field of view
	are pink.

	And then they're a deep, deep red.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	The group has stopped again.  Near the rear, SARAH, NICK,
	MALCOLM, LUDLOW, and ROLAND are in a tense conversation with
 CARTER. 
 ROLAND 		How long ago was this?

 CARTER 		Seven, eight minutes.

	Roland looks at them, thinking.  Finally:

 ROLAND 		Then he's dead.  Nobody tells the
		little girl.  Last thing we need is
		screaming hysterics.

	He turns and heads back to the front of the column.

 SARAH 		We have to send someone to look for
		him!

 ROLAND 		You go if you like, but we're not
		waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!

	They look at each other, appalled, but the column starts to
	move.  Numbed, shocked, but left with no choice, they move on,
	one by one.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ISLAND RIDGE - DUSK 
	The column of MARCHERS has finally reached the island ridge,
	where they are silhouetted against the setting sun.  They're
	taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground.

	MALCOLM sits next to KELLY, who's sitting on a log.

 MALCOLM 		You okay?

	She doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to
	sit over next to SARAH.

	Malcolm watches, pained, but Sarah puts an arm around her and
	makes a "she's okay" gesture to Malcolm.

 AT THE RIDGE, 
	ROLAND steps up to the very edge and peers into the island
	interior.  From his vantage point, he's able to see all the
	way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff,
	miles away.  Between here and the cliffs there is nothing but
	gently undulating jungle.

	He refers to one of the satellite recon photos.

 ROLAND 		Looks like the worker village is down
		in there, about a mile and a half
		northeast from the base of these
		cliffs.

	MALCOLM is next to him.

 MALCOLM 		There must be a game trail, some kind
		of path that goes down there.

	Roland looks around at the exhausted MARCHERS.

 ROLAND 		They'll have to rest before we look
		for it.  Eat.  Sleep.  Two hours.
		Then we hit it.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	The group has made camp in the jungle.  The mood is somber,
	most of the MARCHERS asleep already.  Three or four tents have
	been put up.

 IN ONE TENT, 
	KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up
	to his chest.  SARAH comes in.

 SARAH 		There you are.  Your dad's looking
		for you.

 KELLY 		I doubt that.

	Sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry
	the broad red smear across its front.

 SARAH 		Oh, come on.  Go talk to him.

 KELLY 		Why?  He likes to be alone.  I can
		stay with you.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	all is still.  The nocturnal jungle HOOTS and BUZZES around
	the sleeping marchers.

	In his tent, ROLAND abruptly sits up.  As if he heard
	something.  He looks out the open flap.  In the middle of the
	campsite, he sees AJAY stop in his tracks, head cocked.

	Roland gets up and goes outside, joining Ajay in the middle of
	the camp.

 ROLAND 		You hear something?

 AJAY 		No.  I feel something.

	Roland looks at him.  This isn't so good.  He looks out at the
	shifting jungle.  He notices a thin plume of smoke rising up
	over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp.

 ROLAND 		Oh, no.

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Kelly and Sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags, trying
	to get a few minutes' rest.  Sarah's shirt hangs over them,
	swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap.

	As the shirt dangles there, swinging softly from side to side,
	we notice the broad red smear across the front.  Oh, that's
	right -- it's blood.

	The baby T-rex's blood.

 AT THE RIDGE OF CAMP, 
	the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire
	that's been lit by DR. BURKE.

	He's set a small frying pan on top of it, and now he CRACKS
	the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan.

	Roland and Ajay run up behind him.

 ROLAND 			(hisses)
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! 
	Burke leaps out of the way as Roland kicks dirt on the fire.

 BMBB! 
	Roland, Ajay, and Burke all freeze.  What was that?

 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly sit up.  They felt it too.

 BMBB! 
 AT THE COCKING FIRE, 
 ROLAND 		Get my weapon.

	Ajay turns and trots away a few steps, then stops cold,
	staring down at the ground.

 BMBB! 
	A recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp, and
	impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles -- concentric
	circles spreading to the outer edges.

 BMBB! 
 IN SARAH'S TENT, 
	Sarah and Kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food
	into Ziploc bags.

 BMBB! 
	Now they leap into Sarah's sleeping bag, to seal themselves,
	and draw the zipper up, all the way around.

	Outside, the silhouette of the rex's head passes by the tent.
	Sarah works faster, her fingers struggling to close the last
	few inches, but --

	-- the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent.  It
	sniffs, SNORTING the air in and out.  It looks around the
	tent.

	It sniffs Sarah's hanging shirt, the one that is stained with
	the blood of the baby tyrannosaur.  The adult tyrannosaur
	GURGLES again, COOING and cocking its head curiously.

	In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely
	visible, wide in panic.  The rex sniffs and nudges the bag,
	trying to figure out what this thing is.

	It rolls the bag over once, decides it's uninteresting, and
	then rises, straights up --

	-- taking the whole tent with it!  The stakes pop out of the
	ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters
	away, leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground
	beneath it.

 IN THE CAMPSITE, 
	the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR now steps out of the jungle, joining
	the first.  Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake
	up.  Many of them start to run.

	Roland scrambles toward his tent, where he can see his weapon
	lying near the open flap.  As he draws close, an enormous
	T-rex foot stomps down on the tent, driving the rifle deep
	into the mud.

	Roland, weaponless, stands frozen, watching as the panicked
	Hunters flee in all directions.

 ROLAND FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, DON'T RUN! 
	But they ignore him, sweeping him up in the wave of flushed
	prey that pours across the campsite.  Some toss random and
	ill-aimed GUNSHOTS back at the rexes.

 ACROSS THE CAMPSITE, 
	NICK bursts out of the crowd, sees Kelly and Sarah struggling
	to get out of the sleeping bag, and grabs each by an arm.  He
	rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him, into
	the jungle.

 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, 
	MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the
	rest of the panicking crowd.  Frantically, he scans the group.

 MALCOLM KELLY? KEEEEELLLY?! 
	But he can't see her.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a
	narrow ravine.

 UP ON A ROCK RACE, 
	Roland scrambles up a steep rock face.  No way in hell he's
	going down  that ravine.  He sees Malcolm, still in the middle
	of the camp, start to head for the ravine.

 ROLAND MALCOLM! OVER HERE! 
	Malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face,
	scrambling to climb up the smooth, steep boulders.

	Behind him, one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the
	camp toward him.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 FASTER!! 
	Malcolm gives it everything he's got, clawing his way up the
	rock face --

	-- and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs --

	-- and Roland reaches down, grabs Malcolm by the hair and
	pulls him up, out of the rex's grasp.

	The rex falls short, but he's close enough that we can hear
	his teeth SNAP together, closing around nothing but air.  It
	turns, sees easier prey in the fleeing Hunters, and takes off
	after them.

	Malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a CRUNCH.  Roland
	unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap.

 IN THE RAVINE, 
	Kelly, in the middle of the fleeing crowd with Sarah and Nick,
	hears her father screaming her name and looks up.  Malcolm and
	Roland are on the rock ridge above them, keeping pace.

 MALCOLM 			(shouting)
 KELLY, UP HERE! 
	But Kelly continues to flee, as the rexes are in the ravine
	now, and drawing closer to the group.

	Some Hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks, but the
	ravine is deepening, there's no way out.  One rex grabs hold
	of a Hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face.

	The second rex picks up another Hunter and snaps its massive
	head left and right quickly, to break its victim's neck.  The
	Hunter goes flying forward and crashes into --

	-- CARTER, Dieter's driver, who stumbles and falls.  The rest
	of the fleeing humans run around or over him, but when the
	rex lifts its foot, we see Carter is actually stuck to the
	bottom of it --

	-- and when the animal takes its next step it CRUSHES him into
	the earth.

 UP ON TH ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm is frantic.

 MALCOLM 		I gotta get down there!

 DOWN IN THE RAVINE, 
	it's obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes, and Nick
	knows it.  He bursts ahead of Sarah and Kelly and spots
	something off to his left.

	It's a waterfall, apparently right in front of a sheer rock
	face.  But there's something about the way the water is
	falling that tells him something.

 NICK SARAH KELLY COME HERE! 
	He grabs each of them and hauls them forward, running straight
	at the waterfall.  Apparently, he intends to jump right into
	the rock, and he's dragging them along with him.

 SARAH WHAT ARE YOU- 
 NICK JUMP! 
	The three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear
	THROUGH the water.

	DR. BURKE, fleeing along with everyone else, is watching as
	they vanish.

 BEHIND THE WATERFALL, 
	there is a small recess, which is what Nick had hoped for.
	It's small, only four or five feet deep, but it's just enough
	for him, Sarah, and Kelly to cover behind the flowing water.
	Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.

 NICK 		Shhhh... shhhh...

	With an enormous SPLASH, something bursts through the
	cascading water and crashes into them.

	Dr. Burke.

 BURKE 		Get out of the way!

	He pulls his way up against the far wall, as far away from the
	water as he can.

	FOOOOM!  Now another shape bursts through the watery curtain.

	A Tyrannosaur head.  Burke gave away the hiding spot.

	The four SCREAM as the rex's jaws SNAP left and right,
	searching for them, falling just inches short.  They squeeze
	as far back against the wall as they can get.

	The rex can't quite get its head all the way through the
	opening --

	-- so it uses its tongue.  A long, dark blue shape slithers
	out of its mouth and touches the humans, trying to wrap around
	them, to pull them out of the cave.

	Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the
	cave, which pushes Kelly further out.

 SARAH STOP IT YOU'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT! 
	But Burke doesn't listen, throwing elbows to make room for
	himself.  His movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth, and
	a flurry of enormous cockroaches, eight or nine inches long
	each, pour out of the wall and swarm over his face and neck.

	Burke SCREAMS and instinctively leaps away, toward the flowing
	water.

	And that's all the leverage the rex needs.  It curls its
	tongue, wrapping Burke up in it and pulling him between its
	teeth.  SCREAMING hideously, he is dragged out, through the
	waterfall, and disappears.

	Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of
	water turn pink.

 UP ON THE ROCK FACE, 
	Malcolm and Roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall
	with Burke, leaving the hiding place unmolested.  Malcolm is
	nearly hysterical.

 ROLAND 		She's okay!  They'll stay in there,
		she's okay!

 IN A JUNGLE CLEARING, 
	routed Hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he
	jungle.  Ahead of them, there is a large open plain covered by
	long "elephant" grass.

	AJAY, running along with them, stops abruptly at the edge of
	the grass, SHOUTING to the others.

 AWAY NO! DON'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS! 
	Not in the frenzy, they ignore him.  Behind Ajay, the enormous
	shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well, holding
	up at the edge of the jungle.

	Ajay, torn between a sense of responsibility and his better
	judgement, opts for the former and races into the grass after
	the other Hunters, waving his arms.

 UP ABOVE THEM, 
	Roland and Malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view
	of the plain below.  Roland can see the Hunters leaving trails
	as they plow through the grass.

 ROLAND 		Elephant grass!

 ON THE PLAIN, 
	the groups of Hunters wades into the middle of the long grass.
	One of them stops and turns, looking back at the jungle trees.

 HUNTER 		They gave up!  They're not chasing
		us!

	There are CHEERS, SIGHS OF relief.  In the distance, AJAY'S
	VOICE can be heard, faintly calling to them to come back.  Up
	on the rock in the distance, they can see Roland, waving his
	arms madly.

	But in the giddiness of their escape, they pay it no mind.
	They continue plowing into the high grass, anything to get
	further away from the tyrannosaurs.

 ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AWAY, 
	the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly, backlit by
	the full moon.  In the distance, the heads can seethe Hunter
	party.  The heads descend, back into the grass.

 BACK WITH THE HUNTERS, 
	they continue forward, oblivious.  Now behind them, four
	more heads rise up in the grass.  As then descend.

	On all sides of the Hunters, the grass ripples as animals move
	forward toward them, undetected, inexorable as torpedoes.

	And these torpedoes are on target.  One Hunter is suddenly
	dragged down, yanked silently below the surface of the tall
	grass.

	In his place, a long, lizard-like tail rises up as the animal
	drops its head to make the kill.

	Behind him, two more Hunters are taken down, and two more
	animal tails rise up in their place.  A Hunter ahead hears the
	RUSTLING and turns.  His face turns white as, behind him --

	-- a VELOCIRAPTOR springs out of the grass.

	Velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs,
	the second tow of each foot bearing an extra-large curved
	claw, carried in a retracted position, with which it slashes
	on attack.

	Like now.  This raptor SNARLS and SLAMS into the body of the
	Hunter, taking him down.  A feeding frenzy ensues.  The
	Hunters run in all directions, but are pulled down and vanish
	into the twitching long grass.

	Another raptor enters from the right, leaps high into the air,
	past the full moon, SLAMS into the chest of more human prey,
	and takes him down, into the grass.

	Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.  He looks around,
	realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long
	grass.

	Around him, four torpedo trails head straight for him.

	Ajay simply closes his eyes.

 UP ON THE ROCK, 
	Roland turns away from the carnage, pained.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. RUINED CAMPSITE - NIGHT 
	SARAH, MALCOLM, KELLY, NICK, ROLAND, DR. JUTTSON, and PETER
	LUDLOW stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks
	decimated, spirits shattered.

	Roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was.
	He has pulled his .800 Nitro Express from the mud and more or
	less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads.

	Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it
	doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.  Malcolm, who is on his
	knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at
	them, but Sarah waves him off -- "she's okay."

	Roland appears, standing over the group.  He looks at Malcolm,
	who has found the Lindstradt rifle, intact.

 ROLAND 		How many rounds did you find for that
		weapon?

 MALCOLM 		Four, counting the one in the
		chamber.

 ROLAND 		Don't let it out of your hands again.
			(to Sara, but looking at
			 Kelly)
		Can the kid walk?

 SARAH 		Ask her.

 ROLAND 		Can the kid walk?

 KELLY 		I can.  I can walk.

	While he addresses the group, Roland straps on one of the
	servo-lights, the shoulder-mounted flashlights that follow
	your gaze.

 ROLAND 		We're going to find a path down into
		the interior of the island.  Load up
		whatever you think you need, and I
		mean need.  If you can't carry it
		indefinitely, don't bring it.  We'll
		hit the worker village in a couple
		hours and be out of here before dawn.

 AT THE EDGE OF CAMP, 
	Roland bends over one of the three-toed footprints left by the
	rex.  Behind him, the rest of the group is packing up,
	slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders.

	Roland bends over and SNIFFS the footprint.  It's filled with
	a liquid of some kind.

	He takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the
	ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling
	it.  Ludlow hovers over his shoulder.

 LUDLOW 		What is that?

 ROLAND 		Piss.

	Ludlow doesn't ask.

 NOW AT THE FIRE, 
	Roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led
	to such disaster.  He grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it
	in his pants pocket.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND and LUDLOW (who, along with Sarah and Malcolm, is also
	wearing a servo-light now) maneuver down a rugged hillside and
	come out in a flattened area.  Ludlow GASPS, looking ahead in
	wonderment.  MALCOLM breaks through the hillside's foliage a
	moment later.  He too stares in amazement.

	SARAH and KELLY come next, then NICK, then JUTTSON.  One by
	one, they all stop and stare.

 SARAH 		God help us.

	They're standing in a flat, sandy area lined with boulders at
	the sides.  The flat area stretches fifty yards from side to
	side and as far as they can see ahead.  But that's not what
	amazes them so.

	Everywhere, the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons.  Some
	are huge, apatosaurs, sixty feet from head to tail tip.
	Others are smaller, herbivores of many different kinds.  The
	more intact skeletons lie on their sides, their ribcages arcs
	of pale bone.  but just as many have been ripped apart, bits
	of carcass tossed in every direction.

 NICK 		I do not feel lucky.

 ROLAND 		Keep moving.

	They march on, tiny figures moving among the mountainous
	skeletons by the light of the full moon.  Roland notices one
	carcass in particular, a recent kill.  It's an enormous
	HADROSAUR with fresh bites taken out of it.

	He bends down, studying the soft earth around it for
	footprints.

 FURTHER ON, 
	Malcolm looks up, noticing the bony shapes around them, which
	fall in heavy shadows like cell bars, seem to be changing.

	He turns, and his servo-light shines on the bones.  But
	they're not bones any more at all, they're pipes, the animal
	graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade
	objects -- twisted, rotting machinery.

 LUDLOW 		We made it!

	They hurry over a small rise --

 EXT. WORKER VILLAGE - NIGHT 
	-- and find themselves at the edge of what was once Isla
	Sorna's worker village.  The size of a football field, the
	town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides
	by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station.  All the way at
	the far end is a large, blocky, four-story building.

	But the town is a mess.  The hurricane that hit here must have
	been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken,
	upended.  And the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing
	up, around, and over everything.  Huge root systems snake
	through the street, making it almost impassable.

 MALCOLM 		The jungle.  It's always ready to
		return.

	Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow.

 ROLAND 		Where's the power and radio setup?

 LUDLOW 		Operations building.  Far end of the
		street.

	A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully,
	silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.

	They pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower.  An empty gas
	station, its vine-snarled pumps now useless.  The only sound
	is the low mechanical HUM of the servo-lights as they follow
	the group's gazes obediently.

	Every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps
	that lies in random places in the middle of the street.
	Malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them.  It's a rock-hard.
	Nick looks over his shoulder.

 NICK 		Lava?

 MALCOLM 		No.

 NICK 		What are they?

 MALCOLM 		I don't know.

	Finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of
	the town.

 LUDLOW 		The radio rig is inside.  It runs
		directly from the geothermal
		generator, so power shouldn't be a
		problem.

 ROLAND 		Good.

	He pulls out his canteen.  Ludlow watches as he screws the top
	off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the
	contents on the outside of it.

	The rest of the group just stares at him.

 MALCOLM 		What's he got in there?

 LUDLOW 		Piss.

 SARAH 		What?

 LUDLOW 		Don't ask me.  The guy's completely
		out to lunch.

 NICK 		What in God's name would he want
		with-

	Roland rejoins them.

 ROLAND 		Tyrannosaur urine.  I don't want
		anything to do with it, and neither
		does any other animal on this island.
		This building is now demarcated as
		the rex's territory.  As long as you 
		stay in that building, you'll all be
		safe until the helicopter comes.

	He drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks
	the load.  Dr. Juttson looks fearful.

 JUTTSON 		Where are you going?

 ROLAND 		After the rex.  I saw a fresh kill
		back in the valley with tyrannosaur
		tracks all around it.  If I'm not
		back in time, don't wait for me.

 SARAH 		You've got to be kidding.

 ROLAND 		Runs against my nature to hole up in
		a cave and wait.

 LUDLOW 		Do you think the rex might have the
		infant with it?

 ROLAND 		Possible.

	Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick.

 LUDLOW 		You know how to work a radio, don't
		you?

 SARAH 		You're going too?

 LUDLOW 		I lost everything I came after on
		this trip, but one T-rex in one theme
		park could single-handedly bail
		InGen out of Chapter 11.

	He takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it
	to Nick.

				LUDLOW (cont'd)
		This is the broadcast frequency.  ID
		yourself as "Harvest Leader."  You
		know what to tell 'em.

 MALCOLM 		You gentlemen feel you have to do
		this now?

 ROLAND 		Now's the perfect time.  The animal
		just fed, so it won't stalk us for
		food.  Predators don't hurt when
		they're not hungry.

	Ludlow double checks the clip on his semi-automatic rifle --

 NICK 		No.

	-- and SMACKS it back into the belly of the gun.

				NICK (cont'd)
		Only humans do.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	The console of a sophisticated radio set-up glows brightly,
	all green, red, and yellow.  NICK tunes the dial to a specific
	frequency.  The radio WHINES and HISSES tuning in.

 NICK 			(into microphone)
		CQ, CQ.  This is InGen Operation
		Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.  Come
		in, please.

	The remaining SURVIVORS, minus Ludlow and Roland, shine their
	flashlights around the dusty, vine-hung interior of the
	communications room.  On the wall a row of chrome letters says
	"We Make The Future,"  but the words are obscured by a tangle
	of vines.  Mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet.

	On one wall, there is a mural of what the completed Jurassic
	Park would have looked like.  Big hotels, Ford Explorers with
	tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures, big crowds
	at the fences around the animal exhibits.  But none of it came
	true, and now even the mural is runny and dust-covered.

	There is a pause, filed only with radio static.  Sarah looks
	at Nick tensely, waiting.  Finally, a VOICE comes over the
	radio, clean as can be.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		Go ahead, Harvest Leader.

	They all breath a sign of relief.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	With Roland and Ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the
	group inside the operations building, main street stands
	deserted and silent.

	Nearly deserted, anyway.  Moonlight shadows lengthen at one
	end of the street --

	-- and FIVE VELOCIRAPTORS STROLL INTO TOWN.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. VALLEY OF DEATH - NIGHT 
	ROLAND AND LUDLOW are back in the valley of death, standing
	amid the giant skeletons of long-dead animals.  Roland bends
	down, checking the carcass of the freshly-chewed HADROSAUR he
	saw earlier.

	A set of giant three-toed rex tracks leads away from the
	carcass, down the stream bed.  Roland follows them.  Ludlow
	follows Roland.

	As they near a bend in the stream, Roland looks down, at the
	surface of the water.  A pattern of ripples moves toward them,
	washing over their ankles.  Roland follows the ripples with
	his eyes.  From up head, around the bend, he can hear the
	sound of an animal eating and drinking.  A very large animal.

	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a  pinch of the ashes
	from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases
	that on the wind.  They float there for a second, suspended,
	then blow back at him.

 LUDLOW 		We're downwind.  Good.

	Roland darts a contemptuous look at him.  He puts a finger to
	his lips, gesturing for silence, then steps up, onto the
	shore.  Ludlow follows.

	They creep forward, toward the sounds.  They round the bend
	and Roland hits his belly, edging up over a small rise.

	Over the rise, he sees the TYRANNOSAUR, about a hundred yards
	ahead.  It's stooped over the stream bed, drinking.  Like a
	bird, it dips its head in the water and then straightens up,
	to let the water fall down its throat.  A dozen COMPYS are at
	the water as well, drinking.

	Roland gently FLICKS the safety on his gun to "off."

	Ludlow edges toward the cover of a low-hanging branch.  As he
	puts his weight on one knee, it presses down hard on the
	middle of a small stick, which CRACKS in half.  Roland turns,
	eyes blazing.

	Out in the open, the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as
	well, staring in the direction of the sound.  But since
	Roland's own head is turned, he doesn't see the dinosaur's
	reaction.  Roland holds a warning finger out to Ludlow.

	Roland turns his head back.  The tyrannosaur is gone.

 FURTHER ON, 
	the trail of three-toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly.
	Roland stops too, gesturing for Ludlow to freeze behind him.
	Roland glances both ways, looking for any sign of the track.

	To the right, the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock.
	A short distance behind them, the rock is solid, a massive,
	green, pebbled boulder ten feet high.  Roland frowns and
	WHISPERS in Ludlow's ear again.

 ROLAND 		We took to the rock.

 LUDLOW 		Why?

	In front of Roland, a palm frond sways gently in the night
	breeze.  Roland's eyes widen.  He pulls out another pinch of
	campfire ash and releases it on the wind.

	This time, the ash blows off, straight away from him.

 ROLAND 		Wind shift.

	They freeze, terrified.  Behind them, the enormous green
	pebbled boulder --

	-- opens an eye.

	That's no boulder, that's the MALE TYRANNOSAUR, standing
	rock-solid still, its natural camouflage blending into the
	surrounding foliage perfectly.  Very slowly and almost
	silently, the rex brings its head all the way around until it
	is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away.

	Roland and Ludlow stand frozen, their back to the rex,
	unaware of its presence.

	Until it exhales.  The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite
	audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks
	ever so slightly.

	Their hearts drop into their stomachs.  Ludlow speaks, his
	voice a queasy HISS.

 LUDLOW 		It's... behind... us.

 ROLAND 			(the very softest whisper)
		It's just fed.  It won't attack unless
		it's threatened.  Don't move.

	As the rex silently cocks its head, sizing up the danger from
	these intruders, it breathes again.  A few strands of Ludlow's
	hair flap in the exhalation.  He closes his eyes, near tears.

	He can't take it.  His eyes dart, glancing down at the weapon
	he holds in his hands.  Unfortunately, it's extended in front
	of him, away from the rex.

	He risks another HISS.

 LUDLOW 		If I don't move, I can't shoot it.

 ROLAND 		Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

	Behind them, the rex appears satisfied.  It starts to swing
	its massive head around, back toward the jungle.  It lifts one
	great leg and takes a step into the trees.

	Roland signs and closes his eyes, relieved.

	But Ludlow seizes the opportunity.  He whips his weapon around
	and drops to one knee.

				ROLAND (cont'd)
 NO! 
	The rex is infinitely quicker.  Ludlow just has time to
	squeeze off a short burst of semi-automatic gunfire when the
	animal whirls, takes one elegant step forward, and POUNCES.

	Ludlow's bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between
	the rex's legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down,
	jaws wide.  They close around Ludlow's body, lift his straight
	up into the air, and toss him once, readjusting their grip so
	it is firmly around his midsection.

	The whole combination of movements takes but half a second.
	By the time Roland turns around, the animal has pivoted and
	darted back into the jungle, carrying Ludlow, still SCREAMING
	and writhing in its mouth.

	Roland raises his gun, to draw a bead on the animal, but
	through the shivering trees, he can only see that the
	tyrannosaur is gone.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM SARAH, NICK, KELLY, and DR. JUTTSON wait nervously in
	the communications room.  An empty can of Dr. Pepper sitting
	on one of the countertops begins to RATTLE.  They look over at
	it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can CHATTERS on the
	formica counter.

	Other objects in the lab begin to rattle too.  Glass jars
	CLANK against one another, books start to drop off the
	shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.

 KELLY 		What's going on?!

	Above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to
	actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into
	the night.  They look up, a deafening ROAR fills the room --

	-- and a helicopter's searchlight floods in!

	As the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the
	violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their
	heads.

 INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
	Up above the operations building, the helicopter circles.  The
	roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber,
	impossible to land open.

	Below, the PILOTS see the SURVIVORS through the torn roof of
	the building.  They wave frantically, their flashlight beams
	piercing the night sky.

 PILOT 		There they are!

	The Co-Pilot scans the street below, but it's choked with
	overturned cars and fallen trees.

 CO-PILOT 		No LZ in the street, too much debris!

 PILOT 		Check the other buildings!

	The Co-Pilot nods and they peel off, swooping over the rest of
	the village.

	At the far end of the street, the Co-Pilot brings the
	searchlight to bear on the large, flat roof of a three story
	building.

	The Pilot gives him a thumbs-up.

 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM, SARAH, KELLY, NICK and finally DR. JUTTSON run out
	the front of the operations building.  At the end of the
	street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over
	the building, to land on its roof.

 MALCOLM 		There it is!

	Happily, the group double-times it down the street, headed for
	the chopper.  Again, those strange rock formations are
	everywhere.  Some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if
	they once dripped there and then turned to stone.

	This time Sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side
	of a car like solidified lava.  Her face falls as a thought
	occurs to her.

 SARAH 		Ian.  It's guano.

 MALCOLM 		What?

 SARAH 		These formations.  They're dried --

 MALCOLM 		Birdshit?

	A VELOCIRAPTORS jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them.

	They don't see it.

 NICK 		Who cares?  Let's go!

	Unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot
	toward the helicopter.  Behind them, the raptor crouches and
	SNARLS, but the sound is lost under the WHINE of the
	helicopter's engines.  It springs, covering the distance
	between them quickly.

	The animal SLAMS into JUTTSON, the last person in the group,
	and takes him down.  Juttson is thrown forward, into the
	others, who fall like dominoes.

	Juttson SCREAMS, his voice an unnatural, high-pitched SQUEAL,
	as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him.

	Sarah looks up, panicked.  Her eyes widen at the sight of a
	SECOND RAPTOR, this one running straight at hr at top speed.
	She buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her
	hands --

	-- and the raptor's foot SLAMS into the ground between her
	legs as it bounds over her and dives onto Juttson, joining the
	first raptor in the kill.

	Panicked, the group scatters in all directions.  Kelly jumps
	up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits
	the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the
	road.

	Malcolm rolls over to the space where Kelly was, but she's
	gone now.  He looks around frantically.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly?!  KELLY?!

	Sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building
	nearest her.

	Behind her, a THIRD RAPTOR gives chase, bounding after her
	with horrifying speed.  Sarah runs flat-out, but her speed is
	nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly.

	The walls of a structure of some kind close in around Sarah,
	and as she leaps across a leather seat and SLAMS a door behind
	her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an
	abandoned car.

	But the car door is thin protection against the charging
	raptor, which SLAMS into the window, head first.  The window
	spinderwebs, but does not yield.  The raptor crumples to the
	ground.

	Sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the
	web.  The raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose
	into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it.

	Sarah SCREAMS and the animal forces its entire head through
	the hole, SNAPPING its jaws just short of her face.

	She hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the
	animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso
	will not fit through the window opening.  It pulls away.

	In the front seat, Sarah gets some very bad news.

	There's no windshield.

	The raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws CLATTERING on
	the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening --

	-- just as Sarah hurls herself out the door.  While the raptor
	struggles to right itself in the front seat, Sarah runs to the
	nearest building, ducks inside, and SLAMS the heavy wooden
	door.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	MALCOLM races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas
	station building, closing the door behind him.  A moment
	later, a raptor bounds after him, SLAMMING into the door.

	Meeting resistance, it bounces off, notices the plate glass
	window next to the door, and pounces at that.  The window
	SHATTERS and the raptor clings to the ledge, staring inside,
	its tail hanging out.

	Just as it gets inside, Malcolm opens the door and comes back
	out, keeping the place of wall between them.  He pulls the
	Lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim --

	-- but the raptor whirls and springs, forcing him back inside,
	through the door again.

	Willing to play along, the raptor turns and jumps through the
	window again.

 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Balancing on the window frame, the raptor HISSES and crouches,
	ready to spring at Malcolm.

	Malcolm takes cover behind the door, which is hanging open
	between them.  He raises the rifle.

	Th raptor springs into the door, BLASTING it off its hinges,
	knocking Malcolm right through a window behind him.

	But the door SMACKS up against the wall, covering the window,
	preventing the raptor from following Malcolm out that way.

	For the moment.

 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
	Malcolm flies through the window and CRUNCHES to the ground.
	He GROANS  in agony and rolls off his bad leg, which is twisted
	unnaturally beneath him, and claws in the mud for the gun.

	ROUGH HANDS reach down, grab him by the shirt, and haul him to
	his feet.  It's NICK.  He drags Malcolm away, but in the
	commotion Nick's duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in
	the street, spilling some of the precious videotapes.

	Malcolm scoops them up.

 NICK 		Come on!

 MALCOLM 		Where's Kelly?

 NICK 		She's with Sarah!

	They race off, down the street.

 CUT TO: 
 INT. KILN HOUSE - NIGHT 
	High above SARAH, we see she is standing alone in a three
	story kiln house, a windowless shed used for firing pottery
	and other construction projects.  Catwalks lined with heavy
	chains hang above her, and onto the floor below, she turns in
	circles, wondering what to do now.

	From outside the kiln house, she hears SCRATCHING, digging
	sounds.  From the other side of the door comes an animal
	SNORT, and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through
	the crack along the ground.

 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, 
	the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously, trying to
	tunnel underneath.

 INSIDE, 
	Sarah runs to the opposite wall, falls to her knees, and
	starts digging a tunnel of her own, clawing frantically at the
	ganging tools always and CLANKS as it tears at the earth below
	it.

	Sarah digs faster.  So does the raptor.

	With about eight inches of space under the wall, Sarah grabs
	hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as
	hard as she can.  It snaps off with a loud CRACK.

	At the door, the raptor stops digging.  It's silent for a
	moment.

	Sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now.
	She starts to lower her body into it --

 -- JUST AS THE RAPTOR'S CLAWS FLASH THROUGH FROM THE OTHER SIDE! 
	Sarah falls back, SCREAMING, leaps to her feet, and jumps up,
	grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above.  She starts to
	climb, up, anywhere up, as the RAPTOR now squirms and thrashes
	its way inside, coming in through her hole.

	Sarah climbs, hauling herself up, leaping from one catwalk to
	another.

	The raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her.

 EXT. KILM HOUSE - NIGHT 
	A window in the slanted roof of the kiln house EXPLODES in a
	shower of glass as SARAH kicks through it and climbs outside.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	Nick drags a badly limping MALCOLM down the main street.  They
	can see helicopter at the far end, engine ROARING and
	searchlight playing over them as they draw closer.  They
	approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the
	street --

	-- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.  Its claws CLACK on the
	roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	They don't stick around to negotiate.  Nick hauls Malcolm off
	into the nearest building.

 INT. WORKER HOTEL - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM hurry inside and SLAM the door behind them.
	They're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind,
	probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to
	spend the night.  The room and staircase wind around a large,
	open-aired central area four stories tall.  They SHOUT at each
	other, frantic.

 MALCOLM 		We can't stay in here!

 NICK 		We're sure as hell not going back out
		there"

 MALCOLM 		This is single-wall construction!
		It's just a shack!

 NICK 		It'll hold!

 MALCOLM 		For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at
		this!
			(RAPS on the door with his
			 knuckles)
		You could-

	With a CRASH, the wood SPRINTERS around the lock and the door
	swings open violently.  Malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard
	on the floor.

	A VELOCIRAPTOR stands HISSING in the doorway.  Nick throws his
	weight against the door.  SLAMMING it hard against the raptor.

	Malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back.

	SLAM!  The raptor charges the door again, this time BLASTING
	it off its hinges, knocking Nick to the floor beneath it.  The
	raptor turns and SNARLS at Malcolm.

	Malcolm swings the gun around --

	-- the raptor lunges at him --

	-- Malcolm's finger closes on the trigger --

	-- and the raptor lands on top of him.

	The weight of the animal CRUSHES him into the floor, but the
	gun barrel now stands between them.  The raptor CHOMPS down
	hard on the barrel, its teeth GRINDING on the metal, and SNAPS
	its head, to tear it from Malcolm's hands.

	Malcolm pulls the trigger.

	The raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart SLAMS into the back of
	its throat.  It makes a GURGLING sound, then convulses
	violently and rolls off of Malcolm, yanking the gun from his
	hands as it falls and dies.

	Nick scrambles out from under the door.  Malcolm tries to
	wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't
	budge.

 NICK 			(helping him out)
		Head for the roof!

 MALCOLM 		I have to find Kelly!

 NICK 		I think she's with Sarah!

 MALCOLM DAMN IT, BE SURE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with
	fear.  She holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only
	two feet from where she's hiding --

	-- a RAPTOR'S FEET pick their way past her, down the middle of
	the street.

	Kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
	NICK and MALCOLM burst onto the roof of the now-burning
	hotel and SLAM the door behind them.  The helicopter is now
	only three rooftops away.  They turn and head for it, Nick in
	the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.

 MALCOLM 		It's too wide!

	Nick looks around, desperate.  A fallen power pole leans
	against the building they're standing on, its lines gone
	slack.

 NICK 		Help me push this!

	Malcolm understands.  He and Nick throw a shoulder into the
	pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other
	direction.  One good hard shove and it falls to the far
	building, THUDDING against it solidly.

	Its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to
	the next.  Nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across
	the gap, hand over hand.

	Behind them, the door of the building SPLINTERS and CRASHES
	open as a raptor throws all its weight into it.  Malcolm leaps
	onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling
	himself across.

	But even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side
	hesitates.  It SNARLS and backs away, refusing to come out
	onto the roof.

 ON THE OTHER ROOFTOP, 
	Malcolm lands next to Nick on the second rooftop.  They look
	back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto
	the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.

 NICK 		It's afraid to come onto the roof!

	Malcolm looks around, at the rooftop.  Strange bits of scrap
	and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd,
	concentric pattern.

 MALCOLM 		Something's wrong.

 NICK 		Look!  Sarah!

	He points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance.
	Malcolm turns, and sees SARAH crawling across the tile.  His
	face turns white.

 MALCOLM SHE'S ALONE!! 
 CUT TO: 
 EXT. KILM HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT 
	SARAH has problems.  Still on top of the kilm house, she
	reaches the edge and pushes off the roof, leaping to the roof
	of the next building.

	She lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of
	sloping roof.  As she pulls herself up --

	-- a RAPTOR appears on the rooftop behind her.  In full
	stride, it leaps, sails over her, and lands on the roof
	ahead of her.

	Sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope,
	away from the raptor.  Suddenly the roof board under her
	SPRINTERS and CRACKS under her weight.  The whole section
	pulls up and starts to slide off the roof.  Sarah, clinging to
	it, rides the roof  planks down, away from the raptor.

	She looks over her shoulder, down --

	-- and sees ANOTHER RAPTOR, waiting for her on the roof of the
	building below.

	Sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof, which
	keeps sliding, falling.  The raptor below jumps up, just in
	time to get WHACKED in the head by the falling roof section.

	Sarah tries to cling to the Spanish tile roof, fingers and
	nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface.  She slides all
	the way to the edge, grabs hold of the gutter, and dangles
	there, suspended above one raptor and trapped below another.

	The raptor above works its way down.  The one below leaps up,
	at her dangling legs.  She has left them in time with its
	jumps, to avoid losing her feet.  This can't go on for long.

	Desperate, she pulls one of the Spanish tiles up from the roof
	and hurls it at the raptor below.  It hits the animal in the
	head, for all the good that does.

	But Sarah keeps on, pulling and throwing more tiles.  She
	edges to the right, toward a fresh supply.

	The raptor above edges even closer, claws CLICKING on the
	slick roof.

	Something interesting is happening.  As Sarah pulls the loose
	tiles free, the ones above slide down, to take their place.
	Sarah sees this and pulls more free, knocking them out of the
	way as fast as she can.

	Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the
	footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.  The
	animal's feet flail and grasp, it slides towards the edge amid
	the tumbling tiles.

	Sarah, seeing it coming, swings in close to the building,
	hugging it as closely as she can.  The raptor falls off the
	roof, right past her --

	-- and CRUNCHES into the raptor below.  Both animals SNARK and
	attack one another.

	Now Sarah, her grip exhausted, falls too, landing right next
	to the enraged animals.  They fight and roll, RIGHT OVER HER.
	She GROANS and hugs the wood below her, the raptors continue
	to thrash and bite, they roll back, toward her, she rolls out
	of their way --

	-- and plunges through a hole in the roof.

 INT. LAB - NIGHT 
	Sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and
	lands in the tray of an old-fashioned hanging fluorescent
	light fixture.

	One end of the fixture's support SNAPS, it drops at a 45
	degree angle, Sarah slides out the other end and CRASHES
	through a window.

 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
	Sarah lands in the mud in the street below.

 CUT TO: 
EXT. BETWEEN TWO BUILDING - NIGHT 
	With a THUD, MALCOLM lands in the mud between two other
	building, one of which he has just climbed off of.  Panicked,
	he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  KELLY!

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 
	SARAH sprints down the main street as fast as she can, toward
	the building on which sits the helicopter.  Above her, she can
	see NICK has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her.

	Sarah reaches the fallen water tower, which is next to the
	helicopter building, and starts to climb it.

 ELSEWHERE IN THE STREET, 
	KELLY is still covering underneath the fallen shed.  In the
	distance, she can see the helicopter.  But she is trembling
	with fear, unable to move.

	The whole shed suddenly RATTLES as something heavy hits it
	outside.  Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror
	is so complex that no sound comes out.  She raises her hands
	in self-defense, whatever's outside ROARS with effort, the
	entire shed is suddenly RIPPED right up off of her, and she
	looks up --

	-- into her father's eyes.

 KELLY 		Dad!

 MALCOLM 		Come on!

	He grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street.

 ON THE ROOFTOP, 
	Sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and
	leaps onto the roof, into Nick's arms.

 NICK 		Where's Kelly?

 SARAH 		Where's Ian?

	Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the
	street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top
	speed down the middle of the street --

 -- WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR CHASING THEM. 
 DOWN IN THE STREET, 
	Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
	They're pretty fast, but it's faster.

	Above them, Nick and Sarah are at the edge of the roof,
	SHOUTING and urging them on.  They push it, faster.

	They reach the base of the fallen water tower, the jumble of
	struts and metal poles that Sarah climbed.

 MALCOLM CLIMB! 
	Kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles,
	pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the
	next one.

	Malcolm stretches and makes the same effort, but for him it's
	much harder.

	Below them, the raptor springs and SLAMS into the struts,
	shaking the whole structure.  It pulls itself up.

	Higher up, Kelly climbs fast, hands gliding over the poles.
	She breaks out into the open, where a long, narrow pole runs
	on a slight incline up to the roof.  She scampers across it,
	running the balance beam.

	She reaches the other side, on a ledge below the roofline, and
	looks back.  Malcolm is at the other end, hesitating, drained,
	breathing hard.

 KELLY DAD, COME ON! 
	Below him, the raptor closes in.  Malcolm sets out across the
	beam, his legs shaking.  He places his feet carefully, he
	doesn't have nearly the balance Kelly did.

	The raptor draws closer.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 FASTER! 
	Malcolm slips.

	One foot twists right off the bar and he spins, arms flailing,
	trying to regain his tenuous balance.

	But he overcompensates and his whole body, wrenches out from
	under him.  He falls, the bar SMACKS him hard in the chest,
	knocking the wind out of him, and he drops, flipping right off
	the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze of bars below.

	He drops right past the pursuing velociraptor, CRUNCHING to
	a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground, probably
	cracking a rib.  Kelly SCREAMS from above him.

				KELLY (cont'd)
 DAD! 
	She stares down in horror at her father.  Wrenched in among
	the bars, Malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six
	feet above him now, with an open attack route.

	The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.

	Up above, Kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans
	and leaps out into space, grabbing hold of one of the bars.

	The raptor springs.

	Kelly spins around, over the top of the bar, and, at the very
	peak of her trajectory, she lets go.

	The raptor sails through down from above, feet first, SLAMMING
	both of them squarely into the raptor's side, sending it
	hurtling into space.

	She lands hard and awkwardly, CLANGING into the spidery
	scaffolding next to Malcolm as the raptor SMASHES to the
	ground below.  But Kelly manages to hold on.

 KELLY GET UP! 
	She grabs hold of Malcolm and pulls him to his feet.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Kelly and Malcolm appear over the roofline.  The PILOTS SHOUTS
	from inside.

 PILOT LET'S GO LET'S GO LET'S GO!! 
	Malcolm and Kelly scramble toward the helicopter.  But at the
	opposite side of the roof, a RAPTOR claws its way over the
	edge as well.

	Malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter, but the
	animal is far faster.  It's only ten feet away, then five,
	they're surely done for this time, when --

 -- KA-BOOM! 
	There comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard,
	and the raptor flies off its feet and lands ten feet across
	the roof, dead.  They look up, to the source of the
	gunshot.

	It's ROLAND, standing at the edge of the roof, holding his
	smoking .600 Nitro Express.

	But there's no time for celebration, as suddenly the
	helicopter's left skid CRACKS right through the surface of the
	roof.

 PILOT HURRY! THE ROOF'S GIVING WAY! 
	The skid dips even further, ripping right through the
	thatch-and-wood construction.  Kelly, who had one foot in the
	helicopter, loses her balance --

	-- as the roof caves in beneath her.

 MALCOLM KELLY! 
	She falls,  SCREAMING, through the hole and down, into the
	building below.

 ONE FLOOR DOWN, 
	Kelly lands with a CRUNCH on the floor immediately below the
	roof, about nine feet down.  But her landing is cushioned by
	an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been
	arranged there.  She lifts one hand, and a yellowy, viscous
	substance drips off of it.

	It's yolk.  She looks around, noticing half a dozen large,
	oblong shapes.  Eggs.

	Above her, Malcolm is scrambling, climbing down to her through
	the wreckage of the CREAKING, crumbling roof.

 MALCOLM 		Kelly!  I'm coming!

	Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape
	is moving.  Rising.  Unfolding, in a way.

 IT'S A PTERANODON. 
	Yep, flying dinosaur.  The enormous animal raises its head, a
	brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long,
	saber-like beak.  It SQUAWKS at Kelly in fury.  She can only
	stare, spellbound.

	Malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls
	its massive twenty-two foot wingspread.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling
	roof, and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris.
	Roland races over to the hole, climbs in a few feet, and
	starts kicking at it, making it larger.

 ROLAND 		Give me a ladder!

 IN THE PTERANODON NEST, 
	Malcolm tries to haul Kelly back up the way he came, but a
	SECOND PTERANODON now appears from the depths of the building,
	SCREECHING in fury at these invaders who have landed in the
	middle of their clutch of eggs.

	An emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof.
	Malcolm grabs Kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other
	and they start to climb out of the nest.

 ON THE ROOF, 
	Malcolm and Kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the
	belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break
	through the surface of the roof around them.

	The pteranodons are emerging.

 MALCOLM GO GO GO GO GOG GO! 
	The helicopter lurches up a few feet, but it yanked to an
	abrupt stop.  The engines WHINE, the chopper just hovers
	there.

 PILOT 		We're snagged on something!

	They loos down. BOTH PTERANODONS have come out through the
	hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the
	helicopter.  They flap their gigantic wings in unison, and
	drag the helicopter off, into the air, away from the nest --

	-- and let go.  Freed, the helicopter gains altitude quickly.

 IN THE HELICOPTER, 
	the PILOTS gape as the pteranodons coast along, right next to
	the helicopter.

 PILOT 		Hang on!  If I tip it hard, I can cut
		'em with the rotors!

 SARAH 		NO!  Don't!  They're not attacking!

	They look out the windows, where, indeed, the magnificent
	animals are merely accompanying them, flying escort as the
	chopper gains altitude.

				SARAH (cont'd)
		They're protecting their nest.
		That's all.  That's all they're
		doing.

	Kelly, completely drained, sits between Sarah and Malcolm,
	each of whom has a protective arm around her.  She sags
	against her father's chest, nothing left.

	He holds her tight and WHISPERS in her ear.

 MALCOLM 		Thank you.  Kelly, thank God.  Thank
		God for you...

 IN THE NIGHT SKY, 
	over the island, the helicopter steadily gains altitude.  A
	hundred feet.  Three hundred.  A thousand.

	As the helicopter is clearly leaving the island, the
	pteranodons now peel off, their job done.  One of them banks
	sharply, right in front of the moon.  The moonlight
	silhouettes it, shining right through its membranous wings,
	lighting it up like a Halloween skeleton.

	Below, the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of
	the wine-dark sea.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. TYRANNOSAUR NEST - NIGHT 
	Elsewhere in the forest, it's not such a happy story.  PETER
	LUDLOW, still alive, drops through the air and CRUNCHES to the
	muddy ground.  Dizzy, bleeding, the breath knocked out of him,
	he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud.

	From behind him, he hears a CHIRPING sound.  He turns.

	He's in the tyrannosaur nest.

	The BABY TYRANNOSAUR faces him, still with a strange
	aluminum-foil cast on its leg.  The baby SQUEAKS with
	excitement as it toddles toward him.

	Ludlow scrambles to his feet, unsure what to do.  Both ADULT
	TYRANNOSAURS stand outside the nest, staring down at him.

	The baby runs toward Ludlow, so he turns and runs away.

	But in an instant, the male brings its head down, knocking
	Ludlow to the ground.  Then it raises its head again.
	Watching.  Waiting.

	Ludlow gets up again and tries to run, but now the female rex
	strikes, knocking him over again.

	Ludlow tries to crawl away, on all fours.  The male bends down
	and closes its jaws around one of his legs, holding it
	tightly.  Ludlow SCREAMS --

	-- and the rex bits down decisively.  The bone breaks with a
	dry SNAP.  Ludlow HOWLS in pain, unable to move, and the baby
	toddles forward eagerly.  Ludlow can only stare as it leaps
	up, onto his chest, and opens its jaws wide.

	Peter Ludlow SCREAMS.

 CUT TO: 
 EXT. CEMETERY - DAY 
	Snow falls in a gray midwinter sky.  In a cemetery, a group of
	fifty MOURNERS is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin
	that is festooned with cascades of flowers.  On a table, there
	is an array of framed photographs --

	-- of JOHN HAMMOND.  A MINISTER reads from the Bible while the
	Mourners wipe away tears.  IAN MALCOLM stands a respectful
	distance from the group, KELLY right beside him.  Malcolm's
	face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white
	winter setting around him.

	At gravesite, a Young Woman turns, looking back over her
	shoulder.  About sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair
	and an honest, open face.  She notices Malcolm, recognizes
	him.

	She nudges a Young Man next to her, about thirteen years old.
	The Young Man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming.

	As the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.

 MALCOLM 		Hello, Lex.  Tim.

	LEX stands on her tiptoes and kisses Malcolm on the cheek.
	TIM extends a hand and Malcolm shakes it.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		This is Kelly.  My daughter.

	They nod their hellos.

 LEX 		I'm glad you came, Dr. Malcolm

 MALCOLM 		I'm sorry about your grandfather.

 TIM 		Thank you.

 LEX 		We were going to call you, in a few
		days.  Tim and I have been thinking,
		and we've decided we want people to
		know about the island.  About what we
		all saw.

 TIM 		We think it's something our
		grandfather would want us to do.

 MALCOLM 			(pause)
		Why?

 LEX 		Because it's true.

	Malcolm looks at her for a long moment.

 MALCOLM 		I know, Lex.  But even if we're the
		only ones who ever know, it'll still
		be true.  You see, I've decided
		that if the world found out about
		what your grandfather created, it
		wouldn't be around for very long.

 LEX 		But -- it was real.  You can't let
		people go on saying it's not.

 MALCOLM 		That's the thing about reality.

	He looks down at Kelly.

				MALCOLM (cont'd)
		Even when people stop believing in
		it, it doesn't go away.

	Kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers
	interlocking with his.

 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
	Back on Isla Sorna, we float over the deserted worker village,
	moving lightly, as in a dream.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you feel the cold wind blowing on
		your face?  That's real.

	We sweep low, landing on the roof the helicopter took off
	from, the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and
	scrap, a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of it.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		Do you see the four of us, standing
		here together, alive?  That's real.

	A PTERANODON land gently on the nest.  Ever so carefully, it
	positions itself over the eggs, lowers itself to roosting
	position, and folds its giant wings around its body.

 MALCOLM (V.O.) 		And maybe that's still that matters.

	The animal raises its head, opens its beak, and SQUAWKS
	approvingly up at the heavens.

 FADE OUT

                             David E. Kelley

     OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON.

     SLOWLY FADE IN TO:


     EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT

     The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts
     off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon
     continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,
     the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely
     call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,
     silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as:

     Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing "I CAN
     SEE CLEARLY NOW." Then--

     OVER BLACK

                         KEOUGH (O.S.)
               And they pay you for this?  To tag
               beaver?

                         WALT (O.S.)
               Imagine.

     As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.  It is
     the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from
     a boat.


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Next to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an
     untipped waiter.

                         KEOUGH
               Ask me, what an animal does in the
               wild is his own business so long as
               he doesn't do it to man.  I think
               Mark Twain said that.

                         WALT
                    (dry)
               I think he didn't.  But since
               you've said it, I guess we're
               covered.

     Keough holds a stare.  Walt drops overboard.  Keough pulls a
     Twinkie from his pocket.  Begins to unwrap.


     EXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY


     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     FIND  KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties,
     approaches.

                         KEVIN
               Kelly.

                         KELLY
                    (warmly)
               Kevin, hey.

     She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort.

                         KEVIN
               Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a
               second?

                         KELLY
                    (great idea)
               Absolutely.


     INT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY

     They enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door.

                         KEVIN
               I had a great time last night.
               Again.

                         KELLY
               Me too.

     Reading his look, she suddenly smells it.  Her face drops.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (deducing)
               That's not what you came to say.

                         KEVIN
               You work for me.  I'm not
               comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

     She's a little crushed.

                         KELLY
               I was working for you when "us"
               started, what's--

                         KEVIN
               I know and I thought I could handle
               it but work and pleasure along with
               somebody else, it's a dangerous
               mix.

                         KELLY
               Kevin, as long as we...
                    (suddenly)
               What was that last part?

                         KEVIN
                    (sheepish)
               The somebody else part?

                         KELLY
               Yeah, that part.  There's...
               somebody who's um...

                         KEVIN
                    (feels terrible)
               Else.

     A beat.

                         KELLY
                    (covering)
               Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This
               uh... this probably wasn't meant to
               be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I
               gotta be ten years younger and you,
               you... you're y'know...

                         KEVIN
                    (reading her mind)
               A jerk.

                         KELLY
                    (you have no idea)
               Oh...
                    (then)
               No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm
               just thrown, I'm...
                    (checks her watch)
               I actually have an early lunch,
               so...

                         KEVIN
               It's ten after nine.

                         KELLY
               Yes, well...
                    (smiling)
               famished.

     And she rushes out of the room.  OFF Kevin, we:

                                             CUT TO:

     EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

     Walt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or
     dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Keough unwraps the second Twinkie.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Walt continues to swim.

     HIS P.O.V.

     Not much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping
     turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves
     it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere
     else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops
     kicking.

     HIS EYES FOCUS

     A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.

     RESUME

     Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake
     seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,
     misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says "what the fuck?"  A beat.  Then
     the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he
     looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down
     there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not
     alone, we can feel he's not alone.

     He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,
     looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides
     he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him...
     and it's no snake.


     EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS

     Keough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.  Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting
     up with a scream!

                         WALT
               Sheriff!!

     And Walt is promptly yanked back under.

                         KEOUGH
               Hey!

     Upon which Walt surfaces.  He swims frantically for a beat
     before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces,
     thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of
     him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him.
     There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso,
     though still conscious.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (going into shock)
               Jesus Christ.

     ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND

     clenching around Keough's arm.

     ANGLE WALT'S FACE

     He knows he's done.  OFF Keough's continued horror, we:

                                             CUT TO:

     BLACK AND WHITE

     A DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood.

     REVEAL


     INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

     We're watching an old classic creature feature.  FIND Kelly
     alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.
     As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the
     popcorn bag and her mouth.

     ANGLE THE SCREEN

     The monster pursues its human victim.

     ANGLE KELLY

     fear on her face.

     ANGLE THE SCREEN

     The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.

     ANGLE KELLY

     as she screams with fear and delight.  Her scream is only
     partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.

     After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  Wearing
     gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  Then from behind
     a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with
     the most blood-curdling scream of all.

     All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE:

     MYRA OKUBO

     Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater.

                         KELLY
               What do you expect, mugging me from
               behind?

                         OKUBO
               I tapped you.

                         KELLY
               Well you shouldn't have.  How did
               you even know where I was.

                         OKUBO
                    (sarcastic)
               Wild guess.

                         KELLY
               I don't like to be scared, Myra, I
               have a thing about fright, don't
               ever scare me.

                         OKUBO
               Kevin told me you were upset.

                         KELLY
               Really?  I never realized he was so
               psychic, how could he detect that,
               did he tell you there's somebody
               else?

                         OKUBO
                    (sheepish)
               Well... he didn't have to tell me
               that part.

     Kelly freezes.  Stares at her.  Then:

                         KELLY
               You?

                         OKUBO
               It started before you, Kelly, I
               never would've--

                         KELLY
               You?

                         OKUBO
               It was just a quick thing which we
               thought was over, and and...

                         KELLY
               You and Kevin.

                         OKUBO
               It wasn't suppose to happen, I
               don't know what to say...

     A beat.

                         KELLY
               You don't know what to say, lucky
               for you action speaks louder than
               words.

                         OKUBO
               Kelly--

                         KELLY
               I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just
               never thought of you as a y'know...

                         OKUBO
               Backstabber?

                         KELLY
                    (don't be silly)
               No.

                         OKUBO
               Liar?

                         KELLY

               Myra.

                         OKUBO
               Shitbutt?

                         KELLY
               I really... I should get back.

     And Kelly peels off to go on her way.  Bumps into a Pedestrian.
     She then gives him an angry shove, under--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (to the pedestrian)
               Don't fuck with me!

     And off she goes.  The Pedestrian and Okubo exchange a look.

     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Coroner's ambulance.  Walt's covered body is being loaded, as
     JACK WELLS, Fish and Game, thirty, emerges from his truck.  He
     approaches the body.  Lifts up the sheet.  Stares a beat in
     disbelief.  Turns to Keough.

                         JACK
               What did this?

     OFF Keough, we:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Kelly's in her office, working at her desk.  Kevin enters.

                         KEVIN
               Hey.

                         KELLY
               Kevin.  How's it going, what's
               happenin', family good, great, nice
               to catch up, get out.

                         KEVIN
               This is business.
                    (then)
               There was an accident in Maine,
               some guy got killed by something in
               a lake.  Probably a bear, but...
               they found a tooth.

                         KELLY
               A tooth?

                         KEVIN
               A tooth they say couldn't have come
               from any bear.  They say it looks
               prehistoric.  Like maybe a
               dinosaur.

                         KELLY
                    (without looking up)
               Oh, well then I'm sure that's it,
               he got killed by a dinosaur,
               anything else?

                         KEVIN
               I want you to go there.

     Now she looks up.

                         KELLY
               Sorry?

                         KEVIN
               I'm sure it's nothing, but you're
               a paleontologist, this is what we
               do, I--

                         KELLY
               This is what we do?

                         KEVIN
               I'd like you to check out this
               lake.  See--

                         KELLY
               Are you on drugs?

                         KEVIN
               Kelly--

                         KELLY
               I'm not going to Maine, I won't
               even go west of Forty-third Street--

                         KEVIN
               Part of our research--

                         KELLY
               I'm not even a field person.

                         KEVIN
               Well on this one I'd like you to
               be.

     Kelly stares back.  The nickle drops.

                         KELLY
               This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?
               Get me out of the office for a few
               days, until--

                         KEVIN
               It has nothing to do with--

                         KELLY
               I never do field work and even if
               I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of
               a dinosaur who bit somebody,
               couldn't you dream up something--

                         KEVIN
               Kelly--

                         KELLY
               I am not going to Maine.  That's
               ridiculous.

     A sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky, nothing but
     Evergreens and lakes below.


     INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly with the Pilot.  She looks a little white.


     INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

     Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue.

                         KEOUGH
               He just came up screaming.

                         KELLY
               Did he say anything?

                         KEOUGH
               He just kinda gurgled.  He was
               pretty much dead.

                         KELLY
               And you didn't see anything?

                         KEOUGH
               The lake was dead calm until up he
               came.  The tooth is in there.

                         KELLY
                    (seeing)
               There?  That's the morgue.

                         KEOUGH
               Yes.

                         KELLY
               Is the dead guy in there?

                         KEOUGH
               That's where they keep them.
                    (then)
               You want me to bring the tooth out
               here?

                         KELLY
               Um.
                    (bravado)
               No, no.  Let's go.


     CLOSE ON THE TOOTH

     Reveal--

     INT. MORGUE - DAY

     The Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and
     kelly.  Walt's torso is covered.  Kelly is examining the tooth.

                         KELLY
               I need to get a microscopic look at
               it.

                         DANIELS
               Fine.
                    (indicating)
               There you go.

                         KELLY
               Maybe I should see...
                    (the body)

                         KEOUGH
                    (reading her)
               I wouldn't.

                         KELLY
               I'm fine, thank you.

                         KEOUGH
               Have you ever seen a dead body
               before, Ms. Scott?

                         KELLY
               Well.
                    (admits)
               At wakes.

                         KEOUGH
               This is a little different.

                         KELLY
               I can look at dead things.

     And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Wait.

     She takes a breath.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Okay.

     And Daniels peels back the sheet.  Kelly strains to disguise her
     extreme horror.  Finally--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (fighting off nausea)
               This... how long did this attack go
               on for?

                         KEOUGH
               Seconds.  Three, four.

                         KELLY
               And this is how he came to the
               boat?

                         KEOUGH
               Yes.

                         KELLY
               Okay.
                    (then)
               And is there a place nearby I could
               go to vomit?

     OFF this, we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. INDIGO MAINE - DAY

     It's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire
     station.  Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store
     loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the
     Sheriff's Department.

                         KEOUGH
               Nobody lives within twenty-five
               miles, 'cept some old couple who
               live right on the lake.  Teenagers
               trek in every once in a while, none
               have disappeared, and none have
               spotted anything unusual.

                         KELLY
               You talk to the married couple?

                         KEOUGH
               Not yet.

                         KELLY
               What kind of backup do we have?

                         KEOUGH
               We?

     That strikes a nerve.

                         KELLY
                    (defensive)
               What?

                         KEOUGH
               Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear
               as to why the Museum of Natural
               History would send somebody here.

                         KELLY
               You have a thing against museums?

                         KEOUGH
               I got nothing against--

                         KELLY
               Ever even been in one?

     He stares back.  Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  As he
     loads it--

                         KELLY
               What is that?

                         KEOUGH
               Lightweight Forward Area air device
               unit.  Whatever's out there, one
               shot with this and he's dead.

                         KELLY
                    (incredulous)
               And you stock these things for
               what, to fend off Russia?

     A beat.

                         KEOUGH
               You're sort of a rude person.

                         KELLY
               It's just that--

     Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a
     white fog from a can of Yard Guard.  Keough holds a look at her.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Mosquitos.  I have a thing about
               mosquitos.

     Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine
     Fish And Game".  Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like
     radar.

                         JACK
               We set?

                         KEOUGH
               Ready.
                    (re Kelly; dry)
               A museum in New York sent us some
               additional back up.

     Kelly shoots Keough a look.  Then:

                         KELLY
               Kelly Scott.

                         JACK
               Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?

                         KELLY
               Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

     Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.

                         JACK
               Did you make anything of the tooth?

                         KELLY
               Yes, it did seem prehistoric but
               I'm sure he just carried the thing
               for luck.  Not that it worked,
               obviously.  It probably somehow got
               lodged into his body.

     Jack holds another look.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Why are you staring at me?
                    (to Keough)
               Do I have a smudge on my face, it
               would be so you not to have told
               me.

     Keough also lets that pass.

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Jack)
               I'm ready when you are.

                         JACK
               Let's go.

     As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm.

                         KELLY
               Excuse me.  One other thing, it's
               a small point, but... I have a
               thing about being humored, and I'm
               feeling humored, more by him, but
               you seemed quick to join in.

                         JACK
               Ma'am, your first impression isn't
               going well.

     As JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.

                         JANINE
               Excuse me?  Is it true you're going
               to look for some kind of monster in
               Black Lake?

                         KEOUGH
               We're just going to investigate an
               accident.  There's no monster.

                         JANINE
               We heard a man got bit in half.

                         KEOUGH
               There was an accident, that's all.
               Nothing to worry about.

     And Janine goes into the store.  The men just watch her go.
     Sixteen going on twenty, nubile.  Kelly just looks at the men,
     gaping at the girl.

                         KELLY
               Please.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Keough, Jack, and Kelly are in a boat motoring towards a
     farmhouse.  No other houses in sight.


     INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

     Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning DELORES BICKERMAN, mid-
     sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy.  She's brought out
     refreshments.

                         BICKERMAN
               Oh, my husband passed away almost
               two years ago.

                         KEOUGH
               My department doesn't have any
               record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (with some attitude)
               Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't
               realize you keep such a firm track
               of the dead.

                         KELLY
                    (gently)
               What was the cause of your
               husband's death, Ma'am, do you
               know?

     Off Bickerman's silence--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               We don't mean to invade your
               privacy but... was he ill, was he
               sick?

                         KEOUGH
               Was he swallowed?

                         KELLY
                    (reprimanding)
               Sheriff.

                         JACK
               Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're
               up here... a man was fatally
               attacked yesterday by some animal
               in this lake.  Do you know how your
               husband died?

                         BICKERMAN
                    (brightly)
               Oh yes.  I killed him.

     Keough clenches his eyes shut.  The old woman's a loon.

                         JACK
               You killed him.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (happily)
               Oh, yes.

                         KEOUGH
               And how would you have accomplished
               this, Ma'am?

                         BICKERMAN
                    (rattling it off quickly,
                     simply)
               Well, he was very ill and he
               refused to go see a doctor and
               well... I think he had Alzheimer's,
               he would be coherent one day,
               incoherent the next and one
               coherent day, he asked me to end
               his suffering.  I wouldn't do it
               but he kept insisting and insisting
               and deteriorating till the point
               the only cognitive thing he could
               really do was that I finish him
               off.  Finally I just gave in and
               hit him on the head with a skillet
               then buried him under the bulkhead.

     Jack, Keough, and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman.
     Off their looks--

                         BICKERMAN (CONT'D)
                    (to Keough)
               Dig him up if you don't believe me,
               Javert.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - DAY

     Keough and Kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the
     thickly wooded shoreline.

                         KEOUGH
               Half mile up, there's a clearing.

                         JACK
               You gonna dig up that lady's
               husband?

                         KEOUGH
               I'll call the coroner.

                         KELLY
                    (looking around)
               What is with this lake?  It looks
               black and... there are no waves or
               anything.

                         KEOUGH
               They wanted to call it Lake Placid.
               But somebody said that name was
               taken.

                         KELLY
                    (to Jack)
               Gee.

     Jack smiles, gets her sarcasm.

                         KEOUGH
               The tents were sent ahead, they
               should already be set-up.

                         KELLY
                    (what?)
               We're staying in tents?

                         KEOUGH
               I told you.  Two days, we'd have to
               camp.

                         KELLY
               Yes, camp, I thought that meant
               Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents",
               will there be toilets?

                         KEOUGH
                    (seeing something)
               What the hell?

     Keough's attention has been otherwise arrested.  He sees
     something in the water.

                         KELLY
               What?

                         KEOUGH
                    (slowing the boat)
               I thought I saw...

                         KELLY
               It looks like a branch.

     He leans over to grab something floating in the water.  Looks
     like a branch.  He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler.
     Connected to the severed head of a moose.  Keough, seeing it as
     he lifts it, screams, throwing it.

     It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the
     HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD.  Kelly rears
     back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder.

                         KEOUGH
               Hey!!

                         KELLY
               You threw it at me!!

                         KEOUGH
                    (denying)
               I just let go of it.

                KELLY                       JACK
       You threw it at me!!       Alright.
           (to Jack)
       Did you see that?

     She belts him again.

                KEOUGH                      JACK (CONT'D)
       Stop hitting me!           Ma'am!

                         KELLY
               Don't throw heads at me,
                    (to Jack)
               and stop calling me "Ma'am"!

     ANGLE THE HEAD

     RESUME

     A beat.  This head looks ripped off the body.

                         JACK
               What is going on here?


     EXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

     A small tent camp is being set up.  People unpacking.  Two
     Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present.  Kelly is with Jack.

                         KELLY
               How big do the bears get?

                         JACK
               Big but... a bear couldn't do that
               to a moose or man in water.  On
               land maybe.  But...

                         KELLY
               And they're sure he didn't get
               tangled under the outboard somehow?

                         JACK
               Hank says he's sure.

     Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings.

                         KELLY
               It really is beautiful, isn't it?

                         JACK
               Never been to Maine before?

                         KELLY
               I was told they discriminate
               against people with hygiene.
                    (off Jack)
               I never believed it.

     He measure her.  Then--

                         JACK
               Why are you here?  Really.

                         KELLY
               I told you.

                         JACK
               The Museum of Natural History
               doesn't send out investigators to--

                         KELLY
               How would you know, what--

                         JACK
               And even if they did, I doubt he or
               she would have problems with tents.

                         KELLY
               So I don't like tents, why--

                         JACK
               You don't like tents, mosquitos,
               look at your fingernails, you have
               about as much business being in the
               woods--

                 KELLY                      JACK (CONT'D)
       What's wrong with my       --as Emily Post, it doesn't
       fingernails these are      make sense--
       perfectly good--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (overriding)
               They sent you out to examine a tooth,
               why are you out here on the on the lake?

     A beat.  Might as well tell.

                         KELLY
               I am a paleontologist.
                    (throwing it out)
               I also was dating my boss he turned
               out to be involved with a co-worker
               who was also my friend and for the
               sake of comfort, theirs, I was
               shipped off to Maine.
                    (then)
               I don't feel like going back yet.

     There.  She said it.  He stares back.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               I'm not making it up.

                         JACK
               Well.  You don't have to stay out
               here, why don't--

                         KELLY
               I've come, I'm here, I'm staying.
               Unless there are ticks.

     We then HEAR the SOUND OF A DESCENDING HELICOPTER.  She looks
     up.  Then:

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Oh my God.

                         JACK
               What?

                         KELLY
               If this is who I think it is.
                    (as it gets closer)
               It is.

                         JACK
               Who?

                         KELLY
               Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook
               mythology professor.  He's done
               some work with our museum.  He also
               treks the world to swim with
               crocodiles.

                         KEOUGH
                    (arriving)
               With what?

                         KELLY
               Crocodiles.  He's an expert on
               them.  And if he's here... then he
               must think that's what's in this
               lake.

                         JACK
               In Maine?

                         KELLY
               There have been Northern sightings.
               But not this North.

     As HECTOR CYR, this giant ball of life, deboards his chopper--

                         HECTOR
                    (spotting Kelly;
                     disappointed)
               You beat me.  Balls.
                    (then)
               I need some of you to help me
               unpack.
                    (to Burke and Stevens)
               You and you.
                    (to Keough)
               Not you.
                    (to Kelly)
               Who do we have from Fish And Game?

               KEOUGH                      JACK
            (to Kelly)                 Me.
         Who is this man?

                         HECTOR
                    (rapid fire)
               I could see the algae blooms just
               coming in, how long has this lake
               been stagnant?
                    (extending his hand to
                     Keough)
               Hi, Hector Cyr.  The Earth is round
               and so should you be.

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Kelly)
               --Who is he?

                         HECTOR
               I'll need any and all topographic
               studies.

                         KEOUGH
               Wait just a second.  You don't just
               fly in here and start barking
               orders.

                         HECTOR
               I apologize, I just don't want to
               lose the light, we've got time for
               a quick scout,
                    (to Kelly)
               you've had work done.

                 KELLY                KEOUGH
            (flaring)             (frustrated)
       I have not.           Who is this man?

                         HECTOR
               Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me
               know when it sinks in,
                    (to Kelly)
               have you seen it?

                 KELLY                      KEOUGH (CONT'D)
       No.                        Mister...

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               It couldn't be a crocodile.

                         HECTOR
               They've been migrating north,
               Kelly, this lake connects to the
               ocean,--

                         KEOUGH
                    (frustrated)
               Mr. Cyr!

                         HECTOR
               C'mon, we're losing light,
                    (to Kelly)
               why does the big one heckle me?

     Kelly yanks him aside.

                         KELLY
                    (sotto)
               Hector.  The big one has no sense
               of humor.  And since he's the one
               who decides whether you get to
               play, try not to be your obnoxious
               self.

                         HECTOR
               That hurt my feelings.

     And it did a little.  Hector is a big Teddy Bear.

                         JACK
                    (arriving)
               If we're gonna go we better go.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

     Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside
     in another.  Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar
     devices.  The calm.  The still.  The beauty.

                         HECTOR
               If he's here, I'll find him.
                    (to Jack, re Kelly)
               Did she tell you we had sex
               together?

                         KELLY
               I never had sex with you!

                         HECTOR
               Even so, you're allowed to boast.
               You look thin by the way, I've
               mentally undressed you, I can see
               your ribcage.

                         KEOUGH
               I really don't mean to be
               discourteous.
                    (patronizing)
               But how is it a person could come
               to believe that a crocodile is in
               New England?

                         HECTOR
               They have saltwater glands, they
               can swim across oceans, it's only
               a matter of time.

                         KEOUGH
               And what would he do come winter?

                         HECTOR
               They can survive winter.  As long
               as their nostrils don't freeze,
               they survive,
                    (to Kelly)
               am I foolish to explain things, he
               had such trouble with my name?

                  KELLY                    KEOUGH
              (scolding)          Hey.
       Hector.

                         HECTOR
                    (to Keough)
               Is this where it happened?

                         KEOUGH
               Around here.  Yeah.

                         HECTOR
                    (knows his crocodiles)
               If he's eaten in the area, he
               shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang
               around the food source.

                         KELLY
               But they're nighttime hunters,
               Hector, he'd probably be on land
               now anyway.

                         HECTOR
               'Cept he wasn't before, was he?
                    (then to Keough)
               You know, when friends or family
               members say things, they tend not
               to register so sometimes it helps
               to hear it from a total stranger.
               You're fat.

                         KELLY
               Hector.

     Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty
     feet away.

                         JACK
               What's that?

                         KEOUGH
               White perch.

                         JACK
               Are they feeding?

                         KEOUGH
               Doesn't look like it.

                         JACK
               They look like they're jumping.

                         KELLY
               They look scared.

     Upon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with
     one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table,
     sending them all flying.

     In an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives.
     Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's
     flipped-over back.  Breathless, they all exchange confused
     looks.  "What the hell happened"?

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               My hair.

     EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNDOWN

     Kelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone.
     Keough is there as Hector approaches.  Jack is approaching as
     well.  Activity bustles in the b.g.

                         KELLY
                    (into her phone)
               None of us actually saw anything.
                    (then)
               I realize this Sir, but something
               flipped us over, I doubt very much
               it was a mink.

                         HECTOR
               What's going on?

                         KEOUGH
               They don't believe her.

                         KELLY
                    (still into phone)
               Thank you, it's so rewarding to
               imagine my tax dollar finding its
               way to you, you Fucker.
                    (she clicks off)

                         HECTOR
               Such the flirt.

                         KELLY
               U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody
               without a confirmation.

                         JACK
               Same thing from Fish And Game.

                         KELLY
               Something's in that water.

                         JACK
               Well until we see it, we're not
               gonna be convincing too many
               people.

     As DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches--

                         GARE (O.S.)
                    (calling)
               Sheriff.

     Keough looks over.

                         GARE
                    (pointing to the ground)
               You might want to see this.

     They all walk over.

     ANGLE THE GROUND

     There's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming,
     surrounding... a human toe.

                         KELLY (O.S.)
               Oh God, worms.  I got a thing about
               worms.

     RESUME

                         GARE
               It's a human toe.

     Hector studies it, picks it up.  Then--

                         HECTOR
               Some decomposition, little acidic,
               it has been swallowed.
                    (to Keough; holding the
                     toe)
               Is this the man who was killed?

     Keough deadpans back.  Then--

                         KEOUGH
               We'd only just met.

                         HECTOR
               Well, you've got a croc alright,
               they're keystone species.

                         KEOUGH
               Keystone what?

                         HECTOR
               Species, keystones affect the
               entire ecosystem, that could
               explain all these worms, the water.
               You've got a crocodile.
                    (proffering the toe)
               Bury your friend.

     Hector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off.  Keough stands
     there, holding the tow, as we:

     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Kelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS,
     as Jack approaches.  He stops.  Takes a second to... well,
     admire her.  She's an attractive woman.  He then approaches.

                         JACK
               Baby crocs?

                         KELLY
               Adult males will charge hatchlings.
               If there's one out there...

                         JACK
               If one could be out there... why
               does Fish And Game tell me it's
               impossible?

                         KELLY
               Because they just consult their
               little indigenous charts.

     A beat, as she tends to her work.

                         JACK
               Listen... if you really do know
               crocs, you should know how stealth
               like they are.  I wouldn't be
               standing a foot from the water.

     She looks.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               He could be right there and you
               wouldn't see him.

                         KELLY
                    (still looking at the
                     water)
               I'd be able to see something.

     Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  As it makes
     a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms.
     Then:

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (realizing)
               Oh that's funny.  That was real
               funny.

     And she heads off.  OFF Jack, we:

     EXT. HECTOR'S TENT - NIGHT

     Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of
     his tent.  From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY.
     Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging.

                         BURKE
                    (shrugs)
               He paid us.  Five hundred.

     Keough continues on toward the tent.


     INT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS

     His tent is on the palatial side.  Stereo, generator, he's got a
     margarita bar going.  There's a party.  Hector's dancing with
     Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC.

                         HECTOR
               You're a beautiful woman.

                         GARE
               Thank you.

                         HECTOR
               And law enforcement, such dangerous
               work.  The idea that you could die
               suddenly with no offspring,
               disconcerting, let's mate, commit
               your genes to perpetuity.

     Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.

                         KEOUGH
               Hey.

     He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC.

                         KEOUGH
               We are here on official business.

                         HECTOR
               Cocktail?

                         KEOUGH
               No!!
                    (then)
               What's with digging the holes?

                         HECTOR
               They come on land and they're
               brazen.  They're also attracted to
               noise, you can see I make a lot of
               it.

                         KEOUGH
               Everybody out, back to your tents,
               now!

     They start to leave.

                         HECTOR
                    (re Gare)
               Could she stay, we've tentatively
               scheduled intercourse.

                         KEOUGH
               No!!  Out!

     And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind
     of funny".

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (to Hector)
               You listen to me.  The only reason
               I'm letting you be part of this is
               'cause you got the helicopter and
               the radar--

                         HECTOR
               And you like me.

                         KEOUGH
               I do not like you.

                         HECTOR
               Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing
               fond of you and it's liberating to
               say so.

     Keough stares back.

                         KEOUGH
               You're a whacko.

     And Keough leaves, to:


     EXT. CAMPSIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     As Keough heads off--

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
               That hurt my feelings.

     A CAMPFIRE

     REVEAL--

     EXT. BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     Kelly stands, alone, skipping stones.  After a beat, Jack
     approaches.

                         JACK
               What are you doing?

                         KELLY
               Skipping stones.  Look how flat
               that water is, you can get ten
               skips on a good one.

     A beat.

                         JACK
               Listen, uh... Hank and I think it
               best if you stay on shore.

                         KELLY
               I beg your pardon?

                         JACK
               Whatever's out there did flip over
               a canoe--

                         KELLY
               I am not staying on shore.

                         JACK
               It's too dangerous for--

                         KELLY
               I didn't fly up here to roast
               marshmallows--

                         JACK
               You flew up here because your boss--

                         KELLY
               I am going out on that boat and why
               are you picking on me, is this some
               kind of--

            KELLY (CONT'D)                  JACK
       hazing, new fingernails    I'm not picking--
       in the woods?

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (overriding)
               I'm beginning to see why you were
               shipped off.

     And her face falls.

                         KELLY
                    (wounded; quietly)
               That was an awful thing to say to
               me.

                         JACK
                    (feels bad now)
               I'm sorry but you're...

     A beat. He doesn't finish the sentence.

                         KELLY
                    (genuine)
               I do know crocodiles and I won't
               get in your way.
                    (then)
               I really do want to be a part of
               this.

     Jack reads her, he can see that she does.

                         JACK
               Okay.
                    (then)
               We're up at six.

                         KELLY
               Good.

                         JACK
                    (a beat)
               'Night.

     There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny
     it.  He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  She
     gives one last look, watches him go.  Then she goes back to her
     book.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - MUCH LATER

     The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet.
     The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT.  CRICKETS.  A LOON.  An OWL.  A
     courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  By
     the water... a black bear takes a drink.

     ANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT

     He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his
     trousers, carrying a revolver.  He walks into the nearby woods.
     He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the
     outside world.  Proceeds to URINATE.  Then... he hears
     something.  The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES.  He STOPS URINATING,
     we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT.  Then quiet.  Must be his
     imagination.  He RESUMES his business.

     More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against
     leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness.
     Quiet.  He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it
     for sure.  Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him.  With his free
     hand, Keough pulls out his revolver.  More RUSTLING... Keough
     points the gun.  Something on the ground is coming toward him.
     He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  The RUSTLING is
     getting LOUDER.  It's almost upon him.  A beat.  CLOSER.
     CLOSER.  Then Keough peels away a bush revealing:

     HECTOR

     Looking into a gun barrel.  He screams.  Keough screams.  Then--

                         HECTOR
               Jesus Christ!!

                         KEOUGH
               What the hell are you doing?!!

                         HECTOR
               What are you doing?!

                         KEOUGH
               You're crawling around like a--

                         HECTOR
               I'm laying a spring trap!

                         KEOUGH
               A spring trap!

                         HECTOR
               I keep telling you, they can come
               on land, I don't wanna wake up in
               the middle of the night--

                         KEOUGH
               I coulda shot you, you--

                         HECTOR
               This could end up saving your life,--

            HECTOR (CONT'D)                  KEOUGH
       You'll be glad you didn't    Hey look, I'm sure you
       shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your
       tongue massaging my          class but I think you need
       hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber
       running off to get your      room, where you can play with
       sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles.
       probably already call mom.

     And now all the others, awakened, are charging.

                         KELLY
                    (arriving)
               Hey!  What is going on?

                   HECTOR                    KEOUGH
       This man takes a pistol     He's crawling around--
       to pee!

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (escalating)
               This is an official investigation,
               and this cuckoo bird is a civilian.
               I don't care how much money he's
               got, he's a total mental.

     And Hector storms off.  A beat.

                         KELLY
               You hurt his feelings.  I think you
               should go apologize.

                         KEOUGH
               Apologize?

                   KELLY                   KEOUGH (CONT'D)
       We're a team here.  It     He's a fruitcake!
       won't kill you to get
       along.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Look.  The thing about Hector... he
               takes this crocodile business
               very...
                    (how to say it)
               he thinks they're Godly.

     A beat.

                         JACK
               He thinks they're what?

                         KELLY
               In his defense, every primitive
               culture known to man deified them.
               He's a mythology professor, he
               thinks crocs are divine conduits.

                         KEOUGH
               Is this 'spose to make me take him
               more serious?

                         KELLY
               It's to make you understand him,
               with understanding comes tolerance.
               Too bad they don't put proverbs in
               Twinkies, my load would be lighter.

                         KEOUGH
                    (befuddled)
               Why does everybody insult my
               intelligence, I have intelligence,
               intelligent people eat Twinkies.

                         KELLY
               I'm sorry.

     Keough shoots a look to Jack.

                         JACK
               Let's just all get some sleep.

     And Keough heads off, under--

                         KEOUGH
               I'm an intelligent person.

     Upon which, he disappears from Earth.  He's stepped into one of
     Hector's pit traps.  A beat.

                         KEOUGH (O.S.)
                    (calmly)
               I shall kill him.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE

     The steam is lifting off the lake.


     EXT. LAKE - MORNING

     Keough, Kelly, Hector, and Deputy Burke are cruising in the
     whaler.  Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear.  Jack
     also has a stick gun for protection.  Hector does not.

                         KEOUGH
               Again, I don't mean to be annoying
               with my questions.  But if it is a
               crocodile which I don't think it
               is.  And if they do charge these
               baby hatchling sounds...
                    (to Jack)
               why exactly would you want to be
               underwater at the time?
                    (to Hector)
               With you it makes sense.

                         HECTOR
               They don't really attack underwater
               and--

                         KEOUGH
               That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--

                         HECTOR
               No crocodile has ever--

                         KELLY
                    (to Hector)
               You should take a flax pole.

                         HECTOR
               And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He
               drowns.  You think about that?

                         KELLY
               I'm just saying last resort.

                         KEOUGH
               Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do
               we have a problem with it dying?

                         HECTOR
               Crocodiles don't sever with their
               teeth, their molars are blunt.

     As if that's suppose to clear it up.  Keough stares back
     blankly.  Then:

                         KEOUGH
               Is this a trick?

                         HECTOR
               What I'm saying is if it's a
               crocodile that cut a man in half he
               would have to be over twenty feet
               which would make him well over a
               hundred years old, it would be
               unthinkable to destroy him.

                         JACK
                    (to Burke)
               Alright, let's just drop here.

     Burke lowers the anchor, as Keough just continues to stare at
     Hector.  Kelly readies the hatchling recorder.  She lowers it
     into the water.

                         KELLY
               They respond pretty quick.  I'll
               wait till you get down before I
               turn it on.

                         JACK
               Good.
                    (climbing over)
               See ya soon.

                         KELLY
               Good luck.

     There was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  He makes eye
     contact with her.  Then drops over.  Goes under.

                         HECTOR
                    (to Kelly)
               Two years married, divorced, used
               to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still
               waiting on his sperm count.

                         KELLY
               What?
                    (off Hector's look)
               Oh as if I'm interested.

                         HECTOR
               As if.
                    (as he's about to go
                     overboard; to Keough)
               Will you miss me?

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Hector)
               I brought a pork chop, maybe we
               could hang it around your neck for
               luck.

                         HECTOR
               No thank you, but maybe later you
               can chew the bark off my big fat
               log.

     And Hector drops overboard.

                         KEOUGH
                    (to Kelly)
               Was that like a homo-sexual remark?

                         KELLY
                    (strict)
               I asked you to be nice to him.

     Keough rolls his eyes.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. UNDERWATER - ANGLE ON JACK - DAY

     Jack, diving.  We HEAR the HIGH PITCH of CROCODILE HATCHLINGS.
     Visibility is again pretty limited.


     EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON HECTOR - UNDERWATER - DAY

     Hector dives through the dark black water.  Visibility is lousy.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

     Jack dives, searched.  Looks ahead, sees something... He moves
     closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head.


     EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER

     Kelly and Keough onboard.

                         KELLY
               He may be a kook but he's also been
               all over the world with them.  He
               even swam in the Grimetti with
               killer Niles all around him, he
               never got nipped.

                         KEOUGH
               And that's why he thinks they're
               Godly?

                         KELLY
               He said he knew it when he looked
               into their eyes.

                         KEOUGH
                    (simple)
               You like Jack?

                         KELLY
                    (thrown)
               What?  I don't even know the guy.

                         KEOUGH
               Hector thinks you like him.

                         KELLY
               Well Hector's a giant cracker.

                         KEOUGH
               You think Jack's handsome?

                         KELLY
               What is this?

                         KEOUGH
               I'm just curious.  I can never tell
               what women think is handsome.  Is
               he handsome?

                         KELLY
               Well.  He's probably rugged
               handsome I guess.  Yeah.

     A beat.

                         KEOUGH
               Am I?


     EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

     Jack and Hector, diving together.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - TWO HOURS LATER

     The boats sit still on the dead calm water.  Kelly works the
     RADAR, Keough covertly eats a Twinkie.

                         KELLY
               It shouldn't be taking so long.

     They both scan the surface.  Dead calm.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector moves about.  We can hear the HATCHLING RECORDER, but
     he's not seeing anything.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - (ANOTHER AREA) - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks about.  He looks up.  Doesn't see much but he gets an
     eerie feeling.  Something's out there.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Keough, Kelly, and Burke, standing idly, scanning the calm
     surface.

                         KEOUGH
                    (into headset)
               Hector, Jack, we show you with
               about twelve minutes of oxygen
               left, and you're on the last tank.
               Time to go home.

                         KELLY
               That was a bust.

     A beat.  Another beat.  Then... something jerks the boat a
     little.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               What was that?

                         KEOUGH
               I don't know.  It was like a tug.
               Something tugged us.

     Upon which something really yanks the boat.  So hard... Kelly
     flips over the back, into the water.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
               Hey!

     The boat is moving, being dragged quickly.

                         BURKE
               Something's got the anchor line!

                         KEOUGH
               Kelly!!

     But Kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away.

     RESUME

                         KEOUGH
                    (into headset)
               Jack!!  Hector!  We're being
               dragged!!
                    (as he starts the motor; to
                     Burke)
               Cut the line!  Cut the fucking
               line!

     Burke goes to work on the anchor line as we ANGLE Kelly,
     treading water, in the middle of nowhere.  She's completely
     vulnerable.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector, swimming for the surface.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly, treading water.  FIND Keough on the boat, he now has the
     engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that
     boat has a fucking strong hold.

                         KEOUGH
               Cut the Goddamn rope!

                         BURKE
                    (working away)
               I'm trying!

     And finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
     with a jump, Burke nearly sails out.  Keough's boat then races
     to Kelly.

     ANGLE KELLY

                         KELLY
               Hurry up!!

     Suddenly about thirty feet away... we SEE fish breaking water.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               Shit!!  Hank!!

     The boat is zooming toward her.  It arrives.  As Keough and
     Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising.

                         BURKE
                    (screaming)
               Look out!!

     And Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow.  Keough
     and Burke pull them both aboard.

                         KEOUGH
                    (back to Kelly)
               Are you alright?

                         KELLY
               I think.  My hair.
                    (then)
               Where's Hector?!
                    (to Jack)
               Where is he?

                         JACK
               We went in different directions.
               That water is thick, you can't see
               through it!


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector is swimming toward the surface.  Suddenly... a shadow
     looms over him.  He looks up.

     HIS P.O.V.

     There is no boat.  We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass.

     RESUME HECTOR

     He's scared.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

                         KEOUGH
                    (into headset)
               Hector!  Hector, we got dragged off
               position, when you surface, you
               gotta yell.


     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector is still charging toward the surface.  The lack of
     visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and
     he wouldn't know it.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

                         KELLY
                    (pointing)
               There's bubbles over there!  Look!

     Keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated,
     under--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               There he is.  Here he comes!

     And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface.

     And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on
     Hector as they lean over to rescue him.  On the far right... two
     eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers.

     Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector,
     Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see
     Hector.  If only he knew what he's not seeing.  The eyes come
     closer.  They're now in the water right below Burke's head.  How
     can he not see it?  A beat.  Another beat.  Then... suddenly, a
     mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water--
     snap.  And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body
     hangs over the boat.  Kelly screams in horror.

     In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone.  OFF
     their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET

     Burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance.  People move in
     silence, the wake of tragedy.  A few State Troopers are on the
     scene.

                         KEOUGH
                    (giving a statement)
               Nobody actually saw it.  It
               happened sudden.

     PAN TO FIND Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a
     phone call, approaches.  He measures her expression, she's still
     in shock.

                         JACK
               You okay?
                    (nothing)
               Kelly?

                         KELLY
               Yeah.
                    (then)
               Nobody saw anything?

                         JACK
               No.
                    (then)
               U.S. Wildlife is on their way.

                         KELLY
               That's probably good.

                         JACK
               Police want to keep it quiet, if
               the press gets word... lake
               monster.  They just want us to sit
               tight.

     ANGLE KELLY

     She is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off
     shock.  Jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her.

                         JACK
               Are you okay?

                         KELLY
               Um... y'know...
                    (swallows)
               Yeah.

     Jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic.

                         JACK
               A man died.  You don't have to be
               so tough.

     She nods, appreciatively.  Part of her would love to collapse
     into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.

                         KELLY
               I'm fine.  I uh... I'm fine.

     PAN TO FIND Keough, walking.  Still visibly shaken.  He
     unwittingly approaches Hector.  They hold a look.

                         HECTOR
                    (genuine)
               I'm sorry.

     A beat.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               Was he a good man?

                         KEOUGH
               Yup.

                         HECTOR
               Whenever somebody dies I consider
               it such a waste that I didn't know
               him better.

     A beat.  Then--

                         KEOUGH
                    (fighting off disbelief;
                     shock maybe)
               His head was just... bitten off.

                         HECTOR
                    (sadly)
               I used to have this recurring
               nightmare that I was headless.

     Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
                    (quietly rattling it off)
               I'd be on the ground looking up at
               my body, no head, walking around
               bumping into everything.  And my
               parents wouldn't let me in the
               house 'cause they'd just bought all
               these new antique lamps and they
               were afraid I'd knock them over,
               made sense, and meanwhile, the
               neighborhood bullies would see my
               round little head on the ground
               looking like a ball, and they'd
               come rushing over to start up a
               game of soccer.  I'd actually feel
               grateful just for being allowed
               into the contest, that's esteem for
               you, what are your thoughts?

     Keough has had enough of this guy.

                         KEOUGH
                    (a powder keg)
               You know, Hector, I'm sure you're
               a fine person in your own mental
               way.  But I think it would be best
               if you and I didn't speak.

     And Keough heads off.  He takes about four steps... then SNAP.
     Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket.  He's stepped in
     Hector's spring-bow trap.  A beat.  He swings upside-down like
     a pendulum.  Another beat.

                         HECTOR
               This is a setback.

                         KEOUGH
               You don't want to cut me down.
               'Cause I'll kill you.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     Kelly and Jack.

                         KELLY
               Hard to believe there could be a
               monster under such peacefulness.

                         JACK
               I thought I might track the
               shoreline tomorrow, look for
               prints.

     She just stares out as if she didn't hear.  And he fixes his own
     stare on her.  Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at
     her, he diverts the stare.  She feigns a non-reaction.  A beat.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               You know they say the brain
               confuses fear for passion.

                         KELLY
               Excuse me?

                         JACK
               When you get scared, the brain
               releases a chemical, same chemical
               it releases when somebody's...
                    (a beat)
               in high school, the thing to do was
               to take the girl to a scary movie.

                         KELLY
               What are you talking about?

                         JACK
               I'm saying between the moonlight,
               a beautiful lake and a monster that
               bites heads off... you look good.

                         KELLY
               Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm
               all moist.

                         JACK
               Forgive me for trying to be nice.

                         KELLY
               Nice?  Nice would be "you look
               pretty," nice is not some man-
               eating monster has tricked my brain
               into making you look good.

                         JACK
               I didn't say it like that.

                         KELLY
               You did, you--

                         JACK
               I was trying to pay you a
               compliment, I was guising it as
               science 'cause I know you're
               comfortable in that arena.
               Science.

                         KELLY
               A man just died, you're hitting on
               me with science.

                         JACK
               Just forget it.

                         HECTOR
                    (arriving)
               Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but
               Hank seems to have gotten himself
               stuck in a tree.


     EXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER

     Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly,
     and Jack approach.

                         HECTOR
               I probably could've accomplished
               freeing him myself but he had a
               look of mayhem on his upside down
               face.

     They arrive.  Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.

                         KELLY
               Hank?

                         KEOUGH
                    (calmly)
               Yes.

     The three exchange looks.

                         KELLY
               Are you okay?

                         KEOUGH
                    (calmly; almost sweet)
               Other than feeling slightly
               embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.
                    (then)
               Could you cut me down?

                         HECTOR
               Promise you won't kill me, first.

                         KEOUGH
                    (calmly)
               I have no interest in ever looking
               at you, Hector.
                    (again)
               Could you please cut me down?

     Jack gives Kelly a knife.

                         JACK
               You cut, we'll hold him.

     Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the
     ground.  He rises.

                         KEOUGH
                    (calm)
               Thank you.
                    (then)
               I lied.

     And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach.  Keough
     chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  And
     suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging
     GROWL.  An attack.  Screams all over, a half-second of confusion
     before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the
     darkness, right at Hector.  Hector dives out of its path.
     Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs.
     Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water
     the giant jaws of a crocodile.

     In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it,
     slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.

     The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
     be one outcome here.  In a matter of seconds, both bear and
     crocodile have vanished.  And the water is calm again.

     ANGLE THE FACES

     Utter catatonia.  Shock.  Whatever they expected to find in this
     expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that.  There are
     no words here.  Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.
     What they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise
     up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear.  A beat.  Then--

                         KEOUGH
                    (admitting)
               Okay.  It's a crocodile.  I'll
               admit it.

     A beat as they gulp air.

                         KELLY
                    (to Jack)
               You're cut.

     There is a little blood over Jack's right eye.  He dabs it.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
                    (to Hector)
               He was an Indo-pacific.

                         HECTOR
                    (daunted)
               Are you sure?

                         KELLY
               Scales were oval.  It was an Asian
               crocodile.

                         KEOUGH
               Asia?  How... how could he get
               here?

                         HECTOR
               Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong
               flushed him down a toilet.

                         KELLY
               He had to be thirty feet long.

     Another beat.

                         JACK
                    (charged)
               Hank.  The little cannon you
               brought, get it.  Guard the
               shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done.
               We made the I.D., our job is
               finished.

                         KEOUGH
               Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I
               wanna know why that monster is
               here.  You got a theory?

                         KELLY
               Why he's that big, I don't know.
               Why he's here... the wetlands are
               being developed, crocodiles are
               moving.  Australia, Fiji, the
               things have started to cross
               oceans.

                         JACK
               But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs
               are social, why's this guy on the
               move by himself?

                         HECTOR
               Maybe he doesn't play well with
               others.

                         KEOUGH
               Is everything a big fucking joke to
               you?

                         HECTOR
                    (re his groin)
               Bite my bishop.

     And Keough starts for him, but Jack intercedes.

                         KEOUGH
               I'm sick of him!

               JACK                       HECTOR
           (interceding)        Let him go!  I'm sick of you
       C'mon.                   too, let him go.
                                      (then)
                                Thing about being rich, Sheriff,
                                my parents had the added luxury of
                                being able to ditch me off at Karate
                                school, I'm a brown belt.  So go
                                ahead.  Take your best shot.

     Keough throws a haymaker, decking Hector.  Lays him out.

                         KELLY
               Hank!

                         KEOUGH
                    (who knew?)
               He said he knew Karate!

                         HECTOR
                    (shaken)
               At school they'd always say "go"
               first.

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Get your big gun and guard the
               shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.

                         HECTOR
                    (muttering as he goes)
               He never said "go".

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Get the gun.

                         KEOUGH
                    (muttering as he goes)
               If I fall into a hole or get
               hoisted into a tree...

     And he's gone.

                         JACK
                    (re Keough and Hector)
               Like little children.
                    (then)
               You okay?

                         KELLY
               Yeah.  I got some stuff for your
               cut.

                         JACK
               I couldn't believe... did you see
               the size of that thing's mouth?

                         KELLY
               I wonder if he's some kind of
               mutant.
                    (then)
               That bear had to be surprised.

                         JACK
                    (taking her arm; ushering)
               Let's get away from the shore.

     She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self-
     consious.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Sorry.

                         KELLY
               It's okay.

     They hold a look.


     EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake.  A
     four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly
     unpassable dirt road into the clearing.

                         TOM (O.S.)
               Told you I could make it.

     As the jeep comes more INTO VIEW, we REVEAL its occupants to be
     six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL,
     ELLEN.  They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk.  As
     they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from
     the branch of a tree that overhangs the water.

                         TOM
               There it is.

                         STEVE
                    (stripping)
               Last one in's a dead man.

     Could be more like first one in.  The teenagers begin to strip
     off their clothes.  As they giggle and laugh we:

     INT. KELLY'S TENT - NIGHT

     Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very
     close to him.

                         JACK
               Ow.  Shit.

                         KELLY
               Just gotta pull it a little
               tighter.

                         JACK
               Who taught you be be a nurse?

                         KELLY
               Father's a surgeon.  I can even
               stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a
               bad idea here.

                         JACK
               No thanks.

                         KELLY
               Keep it dry.  No swimming.

                         JACK
                    (dry)
               Thank you.

     They hold a look.  Then --

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               You're having the best time of your
               life, aren't you?

                         KELLY
                    (caught)
               What?  Why... people have been
               killed, I hardly think I'm having
               a good time, why would...
                    (off his look; copping)
               Does it show?

     Jack nods slightly.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               This is the first time I've
               actually... y'know been in the 
               middle of anything.  I've never
               really even gotten dirty before,
               with me showers have always been
               preventative.

     Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and
     nervous.

                         JACK
               That's why you're here.  To get in
               the middle of something?

                         KELLY
               Maybe.  I've always read about
               what's happened.  I've never... I
               know it sounds silly but, it's nice
               to be someplace while something is
               actually... y'know... happening.

     Something is happening right now.  A beat.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               We should probably go to bed.
                    (quickly)
               Get rest, get some rest.  Go to our
               separate beds, get some rest.

     The Freudian slip of her life.  They hold another look.  Then he
     starts to exit.  He stops at the door, turns back.

                         JACK
               Thanks for the... bandaid.

                         KELLY
                    (please don't go)
               Night.

     He holds another look, then leaves.  OFF her punishing herself
     for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment
     short.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT.  LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'
     flirtatious time.  As they splash and frolic and cop their
     feels, we ANGLE... about fifty yards away.  Two eyes pop above
     the surface... followed by the snout.  GO TO:

     THE CROC'S P.O.V.

     Six fresh delicious teenagers.  Midnight buffet.

     RESUME

     the croc as he slowly starts to move.  The teenagers start to
     take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the
     shoreline.  As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long
     rope... landing with a splash.  About ten feet from the croc,
     waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface.  He could
     easily go for Danny... but he somehow knows the service will get
     better.  As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the
     rope.

                         JANINE
               Here I come.  Ready or not.

     And she swings away... a better swing than Danny's... and she
     splashes down about five feet from the eyes.  Again, the eyes
     don't move.  The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing
     as Tom takes hold of the rope.

                         STEVE
               All or nothing, Tom.

                         TOM
               From the jaws of defeat...

     And he flies away.  It's a leap to die for.  As he splashes
     down... gulp.  Like a seal grabbing a fish... and Tommy has
     vanished.  The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when
     Tommy fails to resurface.  A beat.  They first think he's
     playing a joke.

                         STEVE
               Ha ha.

     Another beat.  Still no sign of Tommy.

                         JANINE
                    (still in the water)
               Tommy?
                    (then)
               This isn't funny, Tommy.

     And now they're concerned.  They all move down toward the shore.

                         STEVE
               Tommy?

                         DANNY
               C'mon,  Tommy.

     And now they're starting to panic.

                         JANINE
               Where is he?

                         DANNY
                    (yelling)
               This isn't funny!!

     Suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water.  The crocodile, Tommy
     in its jaws.  Bloodcurdling screams from all as we:

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

     Hector and Keough both hear the screams of the teenagers.

                         HECTOR
               What's that?

                         KEOUGH
               It came from across the lake.


     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     Keough, Jack, and Deputy Stevens are in the boat, zooming
     towards the teenagers.

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               You said nobody came in here!

                         KEOUGH
               Obviously I was wrong!

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

     Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams
     are on.

                                             CUT TO:


     CLOSE ON JANINE

                         JANINE
               He just took him in his jaws.

     REVEAL

     EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on.
     Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting
     the water.  Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy.  Alive.
     And basically unhurt!

                         KEOUGH
               He was in his mouth?!

                         JANINE
               Yes.

                         JACK
                    (stunned; to Tommy)
               You're okay?

                         TOMMY
                    (in shock)
               I think; just cuts.

                         DANNY
               The thing just came up out of the
               water and kind of spit him at us.

                         JANINE
               You should have signs posted, for
               God's sake!

                         JACK
                    (examining him)
               You're really okay?

     Tommy nods.  Then--

                         TOMMY
               I might need a Tetanus.

     Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief.


     EXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

     Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward
     their tents.

                         HECTOR
               Just spit him back out.  Some shall
               live, some shall die, arbitrarily,
               sound like any higher power we
               know?

                         KEOUGH
                    (dismissive)
               He didn't eat the kid cause he'd
               just swallowed a bear.

                         HECTOR
               Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest
               God--

                         KEOUGH
               I'm tired, Hector.  I know this
               because you're beginning to not bug
               me.

                         HECTOR
               That sounds good but underneath
               it's hurtful.
                    (then)
               Nightcap?

                         KEOUGH
               Raincheck.

     They're growing on each other.  Jack and Kelly exchange a smile.
     Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  They
     continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent.

                         JACK
               Well.  Goodnight.

                         KELLY
               We seem to say goodnight a lot.

                         JACK
               We could not say it and...
                    (suddenly a coward)
               Well, that thing is ambulatory if
               you want somebody in your tent
               to...

     She smiles.  Then:

                         KELLY
               Night.

     He holds another look.  She goes into her tent.  He stands
     there.  A beat.  Waits to see if she calls him back.  She
     doesn't.  He then heads off.  Her head pops out.  Watches him
     go.  Almost calls after him.  Doesn't.


     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

     We see the campsite, looking at it from the water.  All is
     still.  After a beat.  An eye blink.  We are not looking at the
     campsite.  We are CLOSE ON an EYE, REFLECTING the campsite.
     Another blink.  Still another.  We HEAR a slight SNARL.  Then:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE

     Hector and Deputy Gare, inside the chopper, lifting of, to
     begin an early morning search.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. SHORE - (DIFFERENT PART OF THE LAKE) - SUNRISE

     Kelly, Jack, Keough, and Stevens searching for tracks along the
     wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore.
     Their senses are very heightened.  Keough has his cannon gun.

                         JACK
               Get back from the shore.  We know
               how fast he can leap out.

                         KEOUGH
               We shouldn't even really be doing
               this.

                         JACK
               They won't be here till at least
               noon.  We got a few hours to kill.

                         KEOUGH
               So does he.

                         KELLY
                    (obsessing)
               I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it.
               They're drawn to me.  I got a thing
               about ticks.

                         JACK
                    (quickly)
               Ssssh!

                         KELLY
               What?

                         JACK
               I heard something.

     He's staring at a brush thicket.  After a beat, we HEAR a slight
     RUSTLE.  The guns go up quickly.  A beat.  Nothing.  Jack bends
     down, picks up a stone.  Tosses it into the thicket.  And out it
     charges.  Kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they
     realize it's only a beaver.  It scurries into the water.

                         KELLY
                    (trying to gather herself)
               Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

                         KEOUGH
                    (suddenly)
               Look.

     ANGLE A GIANT PAW PRINT

     embedded in the mud.  It must be two feet in diameter.

     RESUME

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Guard the water.

     Kelly and Jack go quickly to examine the print.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               That's pretty big.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     The chopper is descending.  Hector and Gare are inside.

                         GARE
               It seems like we're getting lower.

                         HECTOR
               It happens when I land.

                         GARE
               Why are we landing?

                         HECTOR
               'Cause this is the cove he
               obviously lives in.

                         GARE
                    (alarmed)
               So why are we landing?
                    (then)
               Hector.


     EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly and Jack are still working on the footprint.  Physical
     proximity, which they're both a little distracted by.

                         KELLY
               Thing we can lift it?

                         JACK
               Maybe.  Don't mush it.

                         KELLY
                    (annoyed)
               I'm not mushing it.

                         JACK
               You're mushing it a little around
               the--

                         KELLY
               I'm not mushing it.

     Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all
     of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps.  Her foot lands on a
     long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed
     head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin.
     She screams as they all jump back.

     ANGLE THE HEAD

     RESUME

     They just stare, as Kelly continues to scream.

                         JACK
                    (holding her)
               Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

                         KELLY
               That is it!!

                         JACK
               Really--

                         KELLY
               No.  I keep getting hit with heads!

                         JACK
                    (holding her shoulders)
               Calm down.

                         KELLY
               You calm down!

                         JACK
               Calm down.

     She takes a couple of calming breaths.

                         KELLY
               I'm being very calm.  I'm composed.
               This is the second time I've been
               hit with a severed head, I'm
               entitled to complain.

                         STEVENS
                    (re the head)
               Is that uh...

                         KEOUGH
               I can't recognize him from the
               back.  It looks like him.

     Keough takes a stick.  Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head,
     trying to turn it over.

     ANGLE THE HEAD

     It is Burke.

     RESUME

     Keough leans in for a closer look.

                         KEOUGH
               That's him.
                    (re something)
               What the...?

     Something appears to be in his mouth.  Keough takes a small
     twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
               Now I'm gonna puke.

                         JACK
                    (seeing something)
               You gotta be kidding.

                         KELLY
               What?

                         JACK
                    (pointing)
               Look.

     THEIR P.O.V.

     About a hundred yards north, Mrs. Bickerman is leading a
     blindfolded cow to the water.

     RESUME

     Kelly raises her binoculars.  So does Jack.

                         KELLY
               What is she doing now?
                    (then)
               Mother of God.

                         KEOUGH
               What?

                         KELLY
               Look ten feet into the water.

     THEIR P.O.V.

     There waiting... mouth fully open... is the fucking crocodile.

     RESUME

     Kelly, Jack, and Keough, as they lower their scopes.  They look
     at each other, then back at the foregoing.


     EXT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Bickerman, singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" is happily leading
     the blinded cow to the shore.  The cow, tentative, just allows
     itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is.  As Mrs.
     Bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc.

                         BICKERMAN
               Come and get it.

     And with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump
     forward.  Almost simultaneously, the croc makes its charge and
     the cow is dead before it has a clue.

                                             CUT TO:


     ANGLE JACK, KEOUGH, AND KELLY

     utterly agape.  After a long beat:

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - DAY

     Keough, Kelly, and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs.
     Bickerman.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (indignant)
               I haven't broken any laws.

                         KEOUGH
                    (bordering on
                     condescension)
               Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied
               to us, that could be obstruction of
               justice.  A man's been killed in
               part 'cause of your silence, I
               could make out a charge of reckless
               endangerment and I'm sure PETA
               would be annoyed at how you treat
               your cows.

                         BICKERMAN
               The reason I lied is if I'd told
               you the truth, you'd just hunt it
               down and kill it which seems to be
               exactly what you're doing.

                         KELLY
               How long have you been feeding this
               thing?

                         BICKERMAN
               About six years.  He first appeared
               in May of nineteen-ninety-one.
               Bernie was out fishing and it
               followed him home.  So we threw him
               some scraps and well... he didn't
               seem to bother anybody.  He became
               kind of like a pet who lived in the
               wild.

                         JACK
               He just appeared.  You have no idea
               how he arrived in this lake?

                         BICKERMAN
               No.  Do you?

                         KEOUGH
               Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You
               didn't, by any chance, lead him to
               the lake blindfolded?

                         BICKERMAN
                    (offended)
               No, I did not.
                    (then)
               The crocodile did kill him, though.
               But it was all... it was a mistake.

                         KELLY
               A mistake.

                         BICKERMAN
               One of our horses got loose two
               years ago, went to the lake to
               drink and... well the crocodile
               started coming in, Bernie went to
               intercede and... it was all a
               terrible misunderstanding.
                    (then)
               If I reported it, they would've
               sent people to kill it.

     Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.
     Then--

                         KEOUGH
               Ma'am, how could you not report
               this?  He puts human life at risk
               and--

                         BICKERMAN
               Nobody lives on this lake.  it's
               really his lake now.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     The chopper, free-floating, is drifting near a small cove.
     Hector, in diving gear, is about to go into the water, as Gare
     tries to dissuade.

                         GARE
                    (getting panicked)
               C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy
               but you can't--

                         HECTOR
               I need to see his habitat.

     As he drops in.

                         GARE
               Please.  I'll have sex with you,
               anything, but get out of the water.

                         HECTOR
               He's not gonna hurt me.

     INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman.

                         BICKERMAN
               Murders and rapes in the cities.
               People bomb planes... can the
               police stop them?  No.  But feed
               one little cow to a crocodile...

                         KEOUGH
               You're to wait right here until the
               police show, you're under full
               house arrest.

                         BICKERMAN
               Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.

                         GARE (O.S.)
                    (through walkie-talkie)
               Hank!  We got a problem with
               Hector.

                         KEOUGH
                    (into walkie-talkie)
               What problem?

                         GARE (O.S.)

                    (through walkie-talkie)
               He went swimming.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector is underwater, exploring.


     ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER

     Her radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see
     anything.  She scans the surface closely.


     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than
     the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing
     extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks
     up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a
     cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head
     for the surface.  He swims upward.


     EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS

     Hector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the
     chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to
     breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises
     up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim.
     The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets
     a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other
     way, upon which his face goes rigid.

     HIS P.O.V.

     About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at
     him.

     ANGLE HECTOR

     ashen.

                         HECTOR
                    (weakly)
               Oh.... my.

     The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his
     snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare
     move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the
     idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling
     any spiritual voids.  A beat.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               I suddenly feel a bit foolish.
                    (then)
               You're different from the others.

     The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his
     deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little
     motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will
     cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for.
     To be judged by this symbol of mythology.

     He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly,
     their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an
     instant.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
                    (terrified; trying to
                     convince himself)
               Holy spirit of Sobek.  Holy ghost.
                    (swallows)
               Holy shit.

                                             CUT TO:


     INT. SEA CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

     Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of
     Hector.  And her face freezes.  Oh yes, there's the sign.

     HER P.O.V.

     Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
     slowly follows.

                         GARE
               Hector!!

     We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice.  As he continues
     to slowly backswim.

                         HECTOR
                    (to Gare; forced calm)
               Just turn the ignition, it's fuel
               injected.

     Gare turns the ignition, the ENGINE KICKS and DIES.

                         GARE
               Come on.

     She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER.

     ANGLE HECTOR

     The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
     closer toward the chopper.

                         HECTOR
               I know under the circumstances,
               biting off my head might seem
               viable.  It would cheapen you.

     But nothing's funny about this to Hector now.  What he's staring
     into is death.  His own.  Gare raises her rifle.

                         GARE
               I might get a shot.

                         HECTOR
                    (fear in his voice)
               No.  If you don't kill him
               instantly, I'm dead and you'll only
               kill him instantly if you get his
               brain, which is about the size of
               a cherry.  And even if you were on
               target, a bullet might not
               penetrate his hide.

     ANGLE GARE

                         GARE
                    (re the croc)
               Jesus.
                    (to Hector)
               About twelve more yards.  Keep
               coming just like that.

     ANGLE HECTOR

     craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
     contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS.  Hector quickly locks
     eyes with him again.

     ANGLE GARE

                         GARE
                    (weakly)
               Oh my God.

     RESUME

     By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there
     too.  Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
     it's impossible to discern why.  The crocodile seems poised to
     finish him.  There's a slight GROWL.

     And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an
     EXPLOSION out of the water.  it's an inflatable life vest and as
     it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.

     As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the
     chopper.  In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the
     croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.

     Hector's up on the chopper's ski.

                         HECTOR
               Move over!!

     The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws
     snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.  Hector
     dives into the chopper, screaming.

                         GARE
               Go!!

     She REVS the CHOPPER.  The croc comes up again, chomping down on
     one of the landing skis.  Both Gare and Hector scream as the
     whole helicopter is jerked mightily.

                         GARE (CONT'D)
                    (screaming)
               Go!!!

                         HECTOR
               I'm trying!!!

     The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
     thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare
     FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is 
     undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
     and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.

                                             CUT TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

     Jack is nearly manhandling Hector, pulling him by the elbow
     towards his tent.  Kelly and Keough are there too.

                         JACK
                    (livid)
               This time, I'm gonna kick your
               ass.

                         HECTOR
               Bastard bit my chopper.

                         JACK
               Hey!!

     Jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.  Hector
     yelps in pain.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               You wanna kill yourself, that it,
               you looking to commit some kind of
               divine suicide?

                         KELLY
               Alright, Jack!

                         JACK
               No!
                    (back to Hector)
               You might think they're Godly, you
               might get some spiritual lift
               backstrokin' with dragons but you
               just put a deputy at risk and--

                         HECTOR
                    (flaring)
               Let's not overlook he didn't eat
               me, maybe--

                         JACK
               'Cause he just ate a cow, you
               stupid--

                         KELLY
               Jack!

                         HECTOR
               I'm a civilian!  You don't have any
               authority--

                         KEOUGH
               I can arrest you!!

                         HECTOR
               Then do it!!

                         KEOUGH
               You probably do want to be killed
               by it, that was you trying to meet
               your maker.

                         HECTOR
               So profound and fat.

     Hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.  Kelly looks at Jack.
     Then Kelly follows Hector.


     INT. HECTOR'S TENT - A MINUTE LATER

     Hector enters, sits.  A beat.  Kelly enters, goes to sit next to
     him.

                         KELLY
                    (softly)
               Did you want to be killed by it?

                         HECTOR
               You think I'm that nuts?

                         KELLY
                    (softly)
               Hector.
                    (then)
               What you just did... there was at
               least some sort of a death wish
               going on.

               Nothing's real.

               Excuse me?

               Nothing's real.
                    (escalating)
               I'm rich, people are automatically
               my friends, sycophants ooze out
               like oil slicks and and and--

     He's sounding erratic.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               With crocodiles... everything's
               even.

                         KELLY
               I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would
               think there have to be better
               places to look for autonomy, than--

                         HECTOR
                    (pained)
               I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has
               robbed me of the dream in life, I
               sit here broken, a hollow sack--

                         KELLY
               Oh, bullshit.

     And Hector drops the act.

                         HECTOR
               Didn't even sound good?

                         KELLY
               No.

                         HECTOR
                    (worth a try)
               Eh.  Fuck it.

                         KELLY
               Can I tell them you won't go back
               in the water?

                         HECTOR
               Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I
               don't know...

     He has trouble saying it.

                         KELLY
               What?

                         HECTOR
               Could we have intercourse?

     She just whacks him.  Then exits.  OFF Hector, "worth a shot",

     EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

     Jack and Keough are there to meet Kelly.

                         JACK
               Just heard from Wildlife and
               Florida Fish And Game.  They should
               be here by four.

                         KELLY
               Okay.

                         JACK
               We might as well pack.

                         KELLY
               Good idea.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
               They'll kill him.

     They turn to see, Hector is standing there.

                         HECTOR
               They're not going to be able to
               snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in
               water, he drowns.

                         KELLY
               They could try to tranq him on
               land.

                         HECTOR
                    (knowing)
               They won't.  He's taken human life,
               the mission will be to put him
               down.

                         KEOUGH
               Gee, that would really disappoint
               me.

                         HECTOR
               Forget about him being God, he's
               thirty feet long, he is a miracle
               of nature, who somehow made his way
               to Maine.  This is a grand beast.
               A grand dragon.  An attempt should
               at least be made to capture him
               alive.

                         JACK
               Well, you can try talking them into
               that, if--

                         HECTOR
               I have enough flaxedil with me to
               put him out.  And I think I know a
               way to--

                         JACK
               Forget it.

                         HECTOR
               Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when
               they come, they will kill it.  They
               have to, politically, he's too
               dangerous, if something were to go
               wrong... the odds are he will be
               destroyed,--

                 KEOUGH                    HECTOR (CONT'D)
        Which is exactly          Please, Hank, let me finish
        what...                 I'm having a sane moment, this
                                  is a window.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               If he were neutralized when they
               got here... they might consider
               saving him.

                         KELLY
               And how would we neutralize him?

                         HECTOR
               We lure him on land and pump him
               with the drugs.

                         JACK
               No way.

                         HECTOR
               Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's
               probably a hundred and fifty years
               old, he's bigger than an elephant.

     Hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.

                         JACK
               So maybe Wildlife will try to save
               him, they're more equipped to--

                         HECTOR
               We both know what they'll do.

     Silence.  Admission by silence.  Then--

                         JACK
               Even if we could tranq him-- how
               would we get him on land.

                         KEOUGH
               Other than to eat us?

                         HECTOR
               He follows anything that moves.
               You guys can be in the trucks with
               tranq guns.  If he charges, drive
               off, plus Hank you've got your hand-
               held cannon.  We could do this with
               no safety risk.  If it works, we
               save a beast that should be saved.

     A beat.  They are sympathetic to the idea.

                         JACK
               And again.  How would you get him
               on land?

                         HECTOR
               That's actually the easy part.

     EXT. BICKERMAN'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

     We HEAR the CHOPPER.

                    (to Keough)
               I'll sue you.

                         KEOUGH
               Go ahead.

     And up goes Hector's chopper.  And... REVEAL connected to a long
     cable... a cow.  An airborne cow, dangling from the chopper.

                         BICKERMAN
                    (to Jack)
               You can't take a cow by eminent
               domain.

                         JACK
               We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.

                         BICKERMAN
               You're all fuckers.  Vicious little
               fuckers.

     Jack turns to Kelly.

                         JACK
               Are we crazy?

                         KELLY
               Well...

                         JACK
               We've got a cow hanging from a
               helicopter.

     She shrugs.

                         KEOUGH
               Let's get back to camp.

               keep him from swinging, we're okay.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Hector's chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove.
     FIND Keough, Kelly, and Jack on the water cruising back to camp.
     Keough has his gun.


     EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

     Two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage.
     Kelly, Jack, Keough.  Riflemen are ready with tranq guns.

     ANGLE JACK

                         JACK
                    (into headset)
               Keep enough tension to hold him up,
               Hector, we don't know if he can
               swim.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through headset)
               Right.

                         JACK
               The more he thrashes, the better.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through headset)
               You ready on shore?

                         JACK
               We're ready.

     RESUME

     The chopper lowers the cow.  He starts to kick his legs in
     anticipation.

                         JACK (O.S.)
                    (through headset)
               If he tires, lift him out.

     And the cow goes into the water.  He swims frantically a few
     meters.  The chopper lifts him out briefly.

                         JACK
               It can't work.

                         KELLY
               He has been going after everything.
               It could work.
                    (then)
               But this is not a happy cow.

                         JACK
               He looks like a giant tea bag.

     EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER

     The cow has been dipped more times than a stale donut now and he
     just hangs there like pasta.  Jack, Keough, and Kelly are poised
     with tranq guns on the beach.

                         JACK
                    (looking through
                     binoculars)
               He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is
               he swimming?

                         KELLY

               You do?

     ANGLE THE SCREEN

     There's a mass... moving toward the cow.

                         HECTOR
               He's coming.

               Where?  Where?

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through walkie talkie)
               Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow,
               but straight toward Elsie.

                         JACK
               Can you confirm visually or just
               radar?

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (through walkie talkie)
               Radar, he's underwater.  But he's
               definitely coming.

                         JACK
               Okay.  Lead him in.
                    (to the others; barking)
               Okay, everybody up on the trucks.
               We aim for the stomach or side...
               there's little chance the darts
               will pierce his hide.  Everybody up
               on the trucks.

               On our way.  There, he's surfacing,
               there's the snout.  You little
               sucker.


     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     Sure enough... that giant snout breaks the surface.  Ever so
     calmly... it moves toward the cow.

               Hector, don't you endanger that
               cow.

                         KEOUGH
               She's worried about the cow now.

                    (to the others)
               Let's get ready.

     Hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore.
     Behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  Back on the
     shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action.  Tranq guns.
     rifles... the team is mobilized.  We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from
     the COW.

                         KELLY
               He's mooing.

                         JACK
               You wouldn't?

                         KEOUGH
               They're coming right in.

                         KELLY
               Such a simple idea and it's
               working.  What does that tell you?

                         KEOUGH
               That it's about to go wrong.

                         JACK
                    (into walkie talkie)
               Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget
               to lift up the cow.

                         HECTOR (O.S.)
                    (sarcastic, through walkie
                     talkie)
               Thank you, Jack.

                         JACK
                    (to the team)
               You shoot on my order.  If he
               charges, I'll be yelling "go" which
               means drivers take off.  And drive
               fast, they can move on land.
                    (to Keough)
               You set?

                         KEOUGH
               Don't worry about me.

     Incredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following
     a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline.

     Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The
     big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank
     steak.  The time is now.

                         JACK
               Little closer.  Three, two, one...

     The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping
     at air.  Hector pulls up with the chopper.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Fire!!

     Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts.
     But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to
     swing like a pendulum.  It rocks the chopper.


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

                         HECTOR
               Oh, shit.

     The chopper is in trouble.  The cow sways, the helicopter
     struggles to stay airborne.


     EXT. BEACH - ANGLE KELLY - CONTINUOUS

                         KELLY
                    (screaming)
               Watch out!!

                         JACK
               Keep firing!

     The men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts.


     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

     Hector's having trouble righting his chopper.

                         HECTOR
               Motherfucker.


     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

     Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping
     off the cable.

                         JACK
               Shit!!

     And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it.  It
     crashes into the lake.

                         KELLY
               Hector!!

                         JACK
                    (to Keough)
               Take him.

                         KEOUGH
               I can't.  I'll get Hector!!

                         JACK
               Where is he?!

                         KELLY
               We gotta get to Hector!!

                         JACK
                    (to the driver)
               Back us in a little, we need to get
               a shot!

     Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.  He looks
     around.

                         HECTOR
               Where is he?

                         JACK
                    (to the Deputies)
               Tranq guns down, rifles up!

     The men switch guns, under--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (yelling to Hector)
               Do not go in that water!
                    (to the driver)
               Back us in!!

     As the pick-up backs closer to the shore--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (to Keough)
               If you get a safe shot...

                         KEOUGH
               I'll take it!

                         JACK
               Hector.  Do not move.

     The water is calm again.  A beat.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
                    (to Gare)
               You see anything?

                         GARE
                    (looking through binocs)
               Nothing.  Maybe he swam out.

     Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging
     the truck.  Screams.

                         JACK
               Go!!  Drive!!

     The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off
     balance.  The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains
     his balance.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
               Take him!!

     And Keough blasts.  It detonates the ground near the croc
     causing him to surge airborne into the water.  And he goes
     under.  Silence.  A beat.

                         KELLY
               Did you get him?

                         KEOUGH
               I don't know.
                    (to the Driver)
               Back the truck--

                         ALL
               No!!!

                         JACK
               Hector, you see anything?

     ANGLE HECTOR

     on the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the
     water.

                         HECTOR
               No!

                         KEOUGH
                    (sarcastic)
               I just have this feeling
               everything's totally safe.

                         HECTOR
                    (yelling)
               I see blood.  Maybe you got him,
               Hank.

     And as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the
     crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector
     and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector.

                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
               I can't see him, but this is
               definitely blood.  Maybe you got
               him.

     And as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector
     screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and
     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give
     Hector some cover.

     Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He
     climbs in.

                         KEOUGH
               Where is he?!

                         HECTOR
               I don't know!

     No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs
     toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other
     side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin
     and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes
     right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but
     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.

                         KEOUGH
               Hector!!

     But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again,
     swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (taking aim)
               Alright.  Game over.

     But the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.
     And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.

                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
                    (to Kelly)
               Should I?

                         KELLY
               Wait.

     RESUME

     The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
     But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate.
     He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two
     ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.

                         KELLY
               I think the drugs are kicking in.

     Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to
     free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that
     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even
     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot
     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he
     just cannot go on anymore.

     Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with
     caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.

     ANGLE THE CROC

     He's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his
     eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten.

     ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES

     There's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness.

                         JACK
               I don't think we really want to
               wait for him to catch his breath.

     It continues to breathe heavily.

                         KELLY
               He's through fighting.  Look at
               him.

                         JACK
               I don't care.  Hank.  End it.

     Keough raises his cannon.

                         HECTOR
               No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.

                         JACK
               Yeah and every time we think
               there's no more danger--

     Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the
     water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings
     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
     Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.

     It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing
     into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit
     Kelly.

     They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's
     bleeding.

                         HECTOR
               I'm okay.

                         KELLY
               You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

                         JACK
               Get him onto shore.

                         KELLY
               He heeds a tourniquet.

     Keough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes
     to work.

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               You're gonna be okay.

                         HECTOR
               Guess I finally got bit.

                         KELLY
               Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix
               it.

     A sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...
     the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in
     the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach.

                         KEOUGH
                    (quietly; re the big croc)
               He's done.  He's dying.

                         JACK
               Don't count on it.
                    (then)
               We better take him out.

     But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at
     them... nobody wants wants to take him out.

     ANGLE THE CROC

     looking back at them.  He knows he's in their hands now.  He
     knows.

     ANGLE THE HUMANS

     A beat.

                         HECTOR
                    (quiet)
               Flax him under his tail.  Two
               hundred cc's.  Under the tail,
               that'll put him to sleep.

     Upon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS.  Florida Fish And Game,
     U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene.

                         JACK
               Thank God.

     OFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches.
     Stares with utter disbelief.

                         KELLY
               We need to get it some medical
               help.
                    (re Hector)
               And him too.

     By now the Florida army has moved in.  They all stare with the
     same suspended disbelief.

                         KEOUGH
                    (explaining)
               We trapped him with our chopper.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATER

     A crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying
     to free it from the wreckage.  FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector,
     on a stretcher.  Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there.

                         PARAMEDIC
               We're gonna airvac him to Portland.

                         KELLY
               Okay.
                    (to Hector)
               That's where they're taking the
               croc, Hector, they've got some big
               tank there.

                         HECTOR
               He's gonna live?

                         KELLY
               Yeah.  Thanks to you.

                         HECTOR
               And Hank.
                    (to Keough)
               I know you weren't really trying to
               hit him.

                         KEOUGH
                    (gently)
               I was aiming for you.

     Hector smiles.

                         HECTOR
               Thanks for the rescue.

     Jack leans down.

                         JACK
               You take care.

                         HECTOR
               You talk to Bickerman?

                         JACK
               She didn't tell us about the other
               croc 'cause she was afraid we'd
               blow it's head off.

                         HECTOR
               Women's intuition.  Are there
               anymore?

                         JACK
               Just those two.

                         PARAMEDIC
               We gotta take him.

                         JACK
               Okay.

                         PARAMEDIC
               We got room for one.

                         JACK
               Well... I got stuff to pack up
               and...

     He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"--

                         KEOUGH
                    (grudging)
               I'll go.

     Hector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to
     Jack.

                         KEOUGH
               Thanks for your help.

                         JACK
               You too.

     Handshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get
     from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly.

                         KELLY
               I'm sure this would offend you on
               principal but... could we keep in
               touch?

                         KEOUGH
               I guess.

     And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush,
     boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.

                         KELLY
               Well...

                         JACK
               You wanna ride in my truck?

                         GARE
                    (arriving)
               Your truck is jammed.  Should we
               take some stuff out?

                         KELLY
               No, no, I'll be a while anyway.
               I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.

                         JACK
               You sure?  I don't mind...

                         KELLY
               No, I actually want to stay for a
               little while.

     They hold a look.  Then--

                         KELLY (CONT'D)
               I'll miss you most of all
               scarecrow.

     And she kisses his cheek.

                         JACK
               If I'm ever in New York...

                         KELLY
               Yeah.

     They hold another look.

                         JACK
               Y'know, if we didn't live in
               separate worlds and...
                    (a beat)

                         KELLY
               But we do.
                    (then)
               Hey, we'll always have Maine.

     He smiles.

                         JACK
               It was... something meeting you.

                         KELLY
               Likewise.

     He kisses her hand.  Holds a look.  Heads off.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. BEACH - DUSK

     The tents are down, everything's packed.  A couple trucks
     remain.  The croc is gone.  Things are quiet.  Kelly stands down
     by the water, staring out.

     HER P.O.V.

     Hypnotic beauty.  The lake doesn't even ripple.  She soaks it in
     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
     this again.  She HEARS every BIRD.  Including a DISTANT LOON.
     Serenity has returned.  Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping
     out, four, five, six skips.  Kelly turns around.  Jack stands
     there.  They hold a look.

                         JACK
               I thought I should say goodbye to
               the lake too.

     He approaches.  Takes her hand.

                         KELLY
                    (weakly)
               Different worlds, Jack.

                         JACK
               Yeah, I thought about that as I was
               driving... and... I haven't found
               somebody in my world.  You found
               anyone in yours?

                         KELLY
               No.

                         JACK
               So I was thinking... maybe if I met
               anybody in my world who was good
               for you and if you know somebody in
               New York good for me, we could fix
               each other up.

                         KELLY
               You think?

                         JACK
               Worth a try.  We don't wanna be
               alone forever, do we?

                         KELLY
               Probably not.

     They hold a look.  He kisses her softly.

                         JACK
               That was... y'know if the guy asks
               me can she kiss, now I'll be able
               to tell him if you can.

                         KELLY
               Good thinking.

     And they kiss again, this one escalates a little.  They break.
     And then he holds her.  Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an
     AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. MAINE TURNPIKE - AERIAL SHOT - DUSK

     Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway.  Behind
     them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.
     Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike.  Rolling.
     Rolling.  Rolling along.  It doesn't even look ridiculous.
     We've become accustomed to such sights.

     As we lift up higher and higher, Richie Havens' "I CAN SEE
     CLEARLY NOW" RESUMES.  Eventually, we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET

     Jack and Kelly board his vehicle.  They drive off, as we:

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. BICKERMAN FARM - SUNSET

     Daffy Mrs. Bickerman sits at the end of her dock, feet dangling
     in the water.  Throwing bread crumbs.

                         BICKERMAN
               Cute little Buttons.  Mommy loves
               you.  Come eat your supper little
               buttons.  Nibble Mommy's toes.

     REVEAL

     Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are
     swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes.
     OFF them, THEN happy Mrs. Bickerman, we:

                                             FADE OUT.

                   NEWSCASTER (O.S.)                            

         It's hard for us here to believe
         what we're reporting to you, but it                    
         does seem to be a fact.                                
CLICK! In a corner of the BLACK SCREEN, A SMALL TV APPEARS.     
On it, in BLACK & WHITE, A NEWSCASTER sits at an anchor desk.   

                   NEWSCASTER (O.S.)                            

         Bodies of the recently dead are
         returning to life and attacking the                    
         living.                                                
CLICK! With each CLICK, the TV disappears, then reappears in
a new position ON SCREEN. CREDITS ROLL in the surrounding

                   NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

         Murder victims have shown signs of
         having been partially devoured by                      
         their murderers.                                       
CLICK! ANOTHER NEWSCASTER is on the TV now, sitting in a more
modern studio. The broadcast remains in BLACK & WHITE.          

                   SECOND NEWSCASTER                            

         Because of the obvious threat to                       

                                                                

         untold numbers of citizens, due
         to the crisis that is now                              
         developing this radio station will                     

                                                                

         remain on the air day and night.

                                                                

CLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled.




                   SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)                     

         It has been established that persons                   
         who have recently died have been                       
         returning to life and eating the                       
         flesh of the living.                                   

CLICK!





                   SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

         We must not be lulled by the                           
         concept that these are our family
         members or our friends. They are not.                  
         They must be destroyed on sight.                       
CLICK! A THIRD NEWSCASTER, more haggard than the others, sits   
at an ANCHOR DESK on a barren set, still in BLACK & WHITE.

             Every dead body that is not                             
             exterminated becomes one of them.                       
             It gets up and kills. The people it                     
             kills get up and kill. They kill                        
             for one reason. They kill for food.                     

    CLICK!                                                           


                       THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.)                       

             If this situation is allowed to                         
             continue, there will be nothing                         
             left. Nothing.

             It's over. Finished. Finished. It's
             their world now.                                        




                                                                     


    CLICK! IN ABSOLUTE BLACK, A SINGLE WORD FADES UP: "TODAY". A

    SOUND FADES IN TOO. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK! Soft.      
    Metallic. It makes us nervous.                                   

    EXT. UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

    IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American
    town. PEOPLE, seen in SILHOUETTE, stroll past quaint shops
    whose signs promise RELIABLE APPLIANCES, WELL-MADE CLOTHES,      
    SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST
    EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit.
    Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark.     
    TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues.



    Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling
    around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with     
    a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to
    make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player,
    who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where    
    that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK.     
    A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are    
    the "PEDESTRIANS". Flesh is rotting off their bones. The town
    itself, which at first looked so perfect, is ROTTING TOO.

    EXT. "UNIONTOWN TEXACO" - NIGHT




      DEAD TEENAGE COUPLE walks hand-in-hand near the gas pumps
    of a defunct TEXACO STATION. The boy steps on the little hose
    that BINGS when a car pulls in. Out of the building comes...




                                                                     

    ...AN ATTENDANT. It was once tall and handsome. Now his face
    is a wrinkled map of death. He has lost its left arm. Dried      
    blood darkens the shoulder of its jump-suit, where the arm
    was torn away. A "TEXACO" PATCH tells us the Thing used to
    work here. Embroidery tells us his nickname was once "BIG        
    DADDY". He goes to the pump and removes the nozzle. Turns, as

    Insects BUZZ. RATS crawl. HUMAN SKELETONS, most HEADLESS, lie
    everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. Those with heads       
    show various wounds to their skulls. Except for one, which...    
    ...suddenly, startlingly MOVES! Its bony arm reaches up from

                       CHOLO                                           

             That's life, brother. A whole                             
             lotta trash.



    As the men tip the crate onto a dolly, MAGGOTS are revealed        

                                                                       

    in the darkness beneath, squirming in a POOL OF BLOOD.

    THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: BIG DADDY replaces the nozzle in the
    gas pump. Sensing something, it looks around. Up. His dead         
    eyes lock on Riley's. Big Daddy grunts. Responding to him...

              Glancing at Mike's guns) You any
             good with those?




                       MIKE

             Dunno. It's my first trip. Never                          
             had to use `em before.

                        RILEY

              Great. I'm out here with a guy who
              can't shoot. Let's go.



     Mike stands, turns, and...                                       
     ...is GRABBED from behind by a ZOMBIE! It's not one of the       
     three they've been watching. This one wears the remains of a     
     CLOWN SUIT. Half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away.       
     Painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. Its ORANGE HAIR is    
     crawling with SPIDERS. It wrestles Mike to the ground. Opens     
     its lipsticked mouth. Is about to bite Mike's neck when...       
     ...Riley FIRES his .45. BLAM! A bullet SHATTERS the Clown's      
     SHOULDER CAP. The dead thing is pitched backward, but seems
     to feel no pain. It hunkers over Mike again.




                                                                      

      iley FIRES four more times. THREE BULLETS RIP into the
     Clown's CHEST, NECK, CHEEK. Finally, the FOURTH PUNCHES A        
     HOLE above the thing's left eyebrow. The Clown DROPS.            
      ike looks at Riley.

     INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT




     RILEY and MIKE step into a tight, uncomfortable space.           

                                                                      

     Generators whir. Gears turn. The two men open a storage
     locker and strap on ammo belts as...                             




                                                                      

     ...SOMETHING TERRIBLE LOOMS out of the shadows! It moves
     toward Riley and Mike, who can't see it from behind the          
     locker. The LEFT SIDE OF THE THING'S FACE has been BURNED        
     AWAY. Only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye
     bulging from a socket.



     Riley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes,      
     recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose
     intellect is as burned as his face.




                        CHARLIE

              Tcha doin', Riley?




                        RILEY

              Havin' a bad dream.




                        CHARLIE

              I have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just
              look at me, you can tell that I
              have terrible dreams.

                   RILEY

         The town is full of walkers.




                   CHARLIE

         Every town is full of walkers.




                   RILEY

         These aren't just walking. They're
         like...regular folks.




                   CHARLIE

         But they're dumb, Riley. Hell, dead
         folks is near as dumb as me!




                   RILEY

         You learned how to make yourself
         useful. That's what they're doing.                     

                   WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

         They dumped the trash. Cholo's on                      
         his way.



Riley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the     

                                                                

voice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what
looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with   
a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black    

                                                                

leather jacket with "PRETTY BOY" emblazoned across the back.

                   RILEY


                                                                

         This one is. Last one was a guy.




                   MIKE                                         

         What happened to him?                                  
Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE       
encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket.       

                   PRETTY BOY                                   

         I kept his jacket. For good luck.                      

                   MIKE                                         

         Luck?

         Put some flowers in the graveyard.                     
Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the         
control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be    
felt as much as heard as...

     ...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size      
     of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its      
     side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED      
     PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from    
     a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN       
     INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions,          
     piercing the night.                                             
     THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the   
     vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky.   

                        CHARLIE

              (Looking up) `Flowers in the                           
              graveyard'. Why do you call `em
              that, Riley? I don't get it. These
              here flowers ain't the kind you lay
              down on the ground. These here are
              sky flowers. Way up in Heaven.

     THE WHITE MOVING VAN rolls in and parks beside Dead Reckoning.

              Looks like nobody's hit it before.



     FOUR GUERILLAS get into an old T-BIRD CONVERTIBLE mounted with 
     machine guns. TWO OTHER ARMED MEN climb onto MOTORCYCLES. The 
     very night seems to GROWL as everyone starts their engines.

               ou can tell I'm always ready.




                        CHOLO

              I look at you, all I see's an idiot.

     Charlie is wearing four holstered sidearms, two shouldered
     automatic rifles, a REMINGTON...and a sly smile that makes us
     wonder whether he's an idiot or not.

     VROOOM! The T-Bird and the motorcycles pull out toward town.

      iley looks surprised. Cholo mounts a MOTORCYCLE, REVS the

              Somethin'. (Wondering) Somethin'.



     Riley and Charlie start to get back into Dead Reckoning. Mike    
     follows, pausing to look up at the "sky flowers".                

                        MIKE

     like Frankenstein's monster, as if to say "Bad! Bad!" He has     
     learned that fireworks bring danger.

     A DEAD TEENAGE CHEERLEADER, holding filthy pom-poms, looks at   
     Big Daddy, unable to grasp what he's trying to communicate.     
     A SPEAR is DRIVEN through the Cheerleader's face! The spear     
     is held like a lance by HARRY, a guerilla who roars past on     
     his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round-up. Other        
     BIKERS rumble down the street, firing guns.                     
     Big Daddy watches the Cheerleader fall. It throws its head

     CHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously         
     into the dark space. Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts      
     MIKE more on edge. His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom    
     in front of him. Shadows that could be zombies, but are not.     
     Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall-        
     unit, Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON. He goes to the

     Reaches in for the case of champagne. His two hands grab it.     




                                                                      


     A THIRD HAND GRABS IT!




     Cholo looks up. The refrigerator has no back wall. A DEAD

                                                                      

     THING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of
     its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading        
     area beyond. It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL.             
     Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne, and the
     weight of the Dead Thing, which drops on top of him. They        

                                                                      

     roll, struggling. The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip.



     At the front of the store, Mike fumbles with his rifle.          
     Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses.



     Cholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand. The Dead Thing's
     head recoils, but lowers again toward Cholo, the Swastika        
     looming, drooling teeth baring for a bite. Cholo's eyes          
     flash. It's the first time we've seen him scared.                
     BLAM! CHARLIE FIRES one round, right into the center of the      
     swastika on the Zombie's forehead. The Thing crumples.

     MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down
     to the ground by...                                             
     ...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her
     roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is
     last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as...   
     ...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's   
     neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red,
     greenish-black. The blood of the dead.

     T

      here's a RIPPING SOUND as the Father's NECK is PULLED APART
     by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the street.

                                                                     

     The HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddy's hand. His face
     contorts. His mouth opens and closes, trying to utter sounds.   
      ig Daddy drops the head, looking down at its befuddled eyes
     with sympathy. After a moment, the sympathy is joined by
     rage. Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING     
     DOWN on the disembodied head, CRUSHING ITS SKULL.



     The convoy ROARS off, leaving a cloud of exhaust. Big Daddy     

                                                                     

     sees Harry's downed motorcycle lying in the street. The butt
     of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag.               




                                                                     

     Big Daddy goes over. Pulls out the rifle. Tests the weight of
     it in his hand. Curls his finger in through the guard and       
     pulls the trigger.                                              
     BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is
     startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's      
     power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's        
     strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap     
     as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward...              
     ...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE     
     HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed. That's      
     where the bad men came from. That's where he wants to go.       

     REVERSE ANGLE:                                                  

     With the city in the distance, Big Daddy starts walking.
     NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there are MORE.    
     None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that       
     seems to matter is that they have a leader.

     DEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty       
     steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in         
     outdoor yard. (We don't see how big the yard is. Yet.) A         
     SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the
     supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward...       
     ...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN       
     that reads "SUBWAY (TO CITY)".                                   
     In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked
     in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill.             
     RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men.        

                        RILEY


                                                                      

              Harry. Beer?



     Harry doesn't answer.                                            

                        RILEY (CONT'D)

     Harry SPINS! GROWLS! LUNGES at Riley like a beast!               
     Riley has no time to reach for his gun. The Harry-Thing is
     strangling him. SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the        
     snout of Dead Reckoning, Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into

              Got knocked off his bike in town.
              Must have been bit.                                     
     Riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret.

     A mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS. A wide         
     PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks, at the head of which     
     A DERELICT TRAIN is parked.

     The cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the    
     tunnel. CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off.     
     Two guerillas, ANCHOR and MOUSE, who looks like a mouse, ride   
     on the open flatbed with the cargo.                             
     The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast
     menacing shadows. Mouse shifts nervously. Suddenly...           
     ...PLINK! SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE! He JUMPS.            
     Recovers. Wipes his cheek with his sleeve.

     The Guard takes Cholo's weapons and returns a claim check.       
     CHOLO collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that        
     carries him up into an ENORMOUS ATRIUM. The "mall" we saw on     
     TV. SUNLIGHT splashes through glass walls onto box-planted
     trees. Caged birds CHIRP seemingly in tune with the Chopin       
     that lilts over a sound system. SHOPPERS, expensively over-      
     dressed, stroll past stores. OTHER RESIDENTS lunch at            
     "outdoor" cafes. Cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the        
     smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable.

     FIDDLER'S GREEN, a heavily protected HIGH-RISE in the center
     of the city, dominates the skyline. It's where the Fat Cats
     live, protected from urban decay. The building is surrounded
     by unoccupied high-rises that define "the golden triangle", a
     clean section in the center of the city. No ugliness in view.



     RILEY and CHARLIE cross a manicured plaza to a CHECKPOINT

     RILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's "ghetto"    
     zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip
     joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS
     and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs.



      iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting         
     them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to
     a FATHER with a YOUNG SON, patting an OLD MAN on the back.




                        CHARLIE

              Wanna get a drink, Riley? Just
               ook at me, you can tell I could
              use a drink.




                        RILEY

              Later. Gotta see a man about a car.

Charlie follows Riley, who strides into...                      
...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking         
REVOLUTIONARIES, led by MULLIGAN, a defiant man who stands      
on a soapbox. A small audience is gathered in front of him.     
He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.                       

                   MULLIGAN                                     

          Irish accent) How long are you                        
         gonna let him push you around? If                      
         there was enough of us...if you all                    
         would join up with us...we could                       
         pull him down off his throne!                          
Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes   
to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away.               

                   RILEY

         You can't fix a place like this,                       
         Mulligan. You just have to get out                     

                                                                

         of it.




                   MULLIGAN                                     


                                                                

         We've got the firepower, Riley. If
         you and your friends would come in                     
         with us, we'd be unstoppable.                          
Mulligan holds out his bottle to Riley, who passes it to
Charlie, who takes a swig.




                   RILEY                                        

         Everyone's stoppable.                                  
We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN
stands behind him, looking feverish.                            

                   MULLIGAN                                     

         You alright, son?                                      

                   BRIAN                                        

         I'm fine, dad.                                         
As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his        
pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm.                    

                   RILEY                                        

         Antibiotics. For your boy.                             
Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand.        
When he looks up again, Riley is gone.

     Turning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a         
     rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door.
     Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a
     grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers.




                        RILEY

              Where's the car?




                         OBO

              (Waking) What car?




                        RILEY

              My new car. I paid for it. I was                      
              here yesterday. There were two guys
              getting it ready for me.




                         OBO

              There was nobody here this morning.




                        RILEY

              Sonofabitch!




                        CHARLIE

              What happened, Riley. Didja get
              fucked?



     Riley stands there, grim-faced.




                        RILEY

              (A whisper) Come on.

      ING! An elevator door opens. CHOLO, carrying the champagne
     and Cohibas, steps out, walks to "PENTHOUSE NUMBER ONE", and   
     rings the bell. An instant after he pushes the button...       
     ...the door is JERKED OPEN by TYLER KNIPP, 50-something, an    
     African American man in a white butler's jacket. Frightened,   
     he's wielding a SCISSORS, poised to strike.                    

                        KNIPP

              (Lowering the scissors) Oh, Mister

              No lie. I heard...                                    
     A SCREAM RINGS OUT down the corridor!                          

                        KNIPP (CONT'D)

     ANOTHER SCREAM.

              Oh, man. Mister K. sure gonna be                       
              upset about this.                                      
     Cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor.

     Cholo reaches the door to PENTHOUSE NUMBER TWO. It's locked.    
     ANOTHER SCREAM from inside. He FLINGS himself at the door.      
     The LATCH SPLINTERS out of the frame. The door BURSTS open...

     ...and CHOLO enters a dark foyer. The only light comes from     
     another room somewhere inside. A soft, rhythmic SQUEAK, like    

                                                                     

     a child's swing moving back and forth, ECHOES through the
     apartment. It's an eerie, incongruous sound.                    
     On guard, eyes straining, Cholo moves inside. The squeak gets
     louder, the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees...     




                                                                     

     ...a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, HANGING DEAD from a HOMEMADE NOOSE
     suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen! THE BODY SWAYS   
     slowly, the harsh glare making the man's face even whiter       

                                                                     

     than it is. A toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet.



     Cholo stands transfixed for an instant. And in that instant... 



     ...HE IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND! He whirls, ready to kill, but     
     finds only a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, 60-something, wearing a         
     tailored suit and expensive jewelry, her perfectness            
     blemished only by her hysteria.                                 

                        WOMAN

              My Johnny, he killed himself, he                       
              killed himself. My Johnny! My                          
              Johnny!

     Behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed YOUNG MAN, walks   
     up to the hanging corpse. He rights the toppled chair and       
     steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose.

         No, I...




                   WOMAN

         Then, for God's sake, who ARE YOU?!



She resumes her SCREAMING.                                      
In the kitchen, the Young Man is slicing through the rope
when his DEAD FATHER'S EYES POP OPEN! The Young Man is too      

                                                                

busy with the rope to notice. THE HANGED MAN'S EYES BLINK.
Once. Twice. Three times. Its body TWITCHES. And then...        




                                                                

...the Hanged Man turns, making a move on the Young Man. The
motion increases the strain on the light fixture, which pulls   
away, SPARKING, from the ceiling and CRASHES TO THE FLOOR,      

                                                                

along with the Hanged Man and his son.



The entire apartment is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. The woman        

                                                                

stops her screaming. Almost as soon as she does, a SNARL can
be heard from the kitchen, followed by another SCREAM, this     
one coming from the Young Man.                                  
Cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a POKER and a      
MATCHLIGHT, which looks like a pistol, but shoots FIRE from     

                                                                

its tip. He approaches the kitchen, using the FLAME to light
his way. In the FLICKERING GLOW, he sees...                     
...the Young Man lying on the floor. CHUNKS have been bitten
out of his neck and wrist. The body is CONVULSING in the last   
moments of life. THE HANGED MAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.          
Cholo stands over the Young Man and stabs him in the head       
with the poker, jabbing the point all the way through. The      
woman SCREAMS again from the kitchen doorway.                   

                   CHOLO                                        

         Shut up! I gotta hear. Where'd he                      
         go? Where'd the other guy go?                          
Silence. Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Man's head.     
SHUFFLING sounds. He follows them to the other end of the       
kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight.              
The sounds are LOUDER here. Cholo lifts the poker, ready to     
strike. Just as he does...                                      




                                                                








                                                                














                                                                














                                                                














                                                       24.










...the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY    
GUARD lunges into the kitchen, rifle in hand.                   

                   SECURITY GUARD                               

         (To Cholo) Drop it!                                    
Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands.




                   CHOLO                                        

         Hey, no problem.                                       
TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front
door and rush into the kitchen.                                 

                   CHOLO (CONT'D)                               

         No problem, no problem! But there                      
         is a problem. There's a dead guy                       

                                                                

         walkin' around in here.



THE HANGED MAN appears without warning, attacking one of the    

                                                                

guards who just entered, BITING OFF half his left CHEEK,
including the EYE.                                              




                                                                

Before his partner can raise his gun, THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM
HIM! Aims at the Hanged Man.

         ALONE HERE!                                            

She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work.   




                                                                

The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his
legs. The Dead Thing holds him up, as if waltzing with him,     
BITING HIM again and again.                                     
Cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man.




                   BITTEN SECURITY GUARD                        

         I need help. I need help!



Cholo kills the bitten security guard, too.                     

                   SURVIVING SECURITY GUARD                     

         You...FUCK!



Cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard.            

                    CHOLO

         You wanna talk about this? I did                       
         what I had to do. I only did what I

     RILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE.
     Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and
     BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over   
     to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over.     

                        TOUT

              on in.                                                 




                                                                     

     Riley is already in. He has pushed past the Tout and is
     striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets    
     with heavily-armed BOOKIES. We're reminded of a cock-fighting

     stands among them, wearing a Texas Stetson that sticks up
     high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even
     higher out of a snake-skin hat band.



      iley grabs him and spins him around.



      he man's feet are off the ground. Way off the ground. Far
     from tall, he's a little person, who has been standing on a
     platform, wearing a purple satin pimp-suit. He's a Latino,
     who looks like a Chihuahua. And that's his name. CHIHUAHUA.

     In a dark CATACOMB, DEAD MEN are chained to the walls. WHAM!    
     A POLE shoots out. A NOOSE on the end encircles the neck of a   
     captive Dead Man and is cinched tight. TWO MEN hold the pole
     while A THIRD sprays RED PAINT on the Thing's face. ANOTHER     
     DEAD THING is dragged in and sprayed with BLACK PAINT.

     INT. CENTER RING - "THE ARENA" - DAY




     RILEY and CHARLIE drift into a large room that's packed with
     BETTORS hooting and hollering like football fans. They're all
     jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an
     IRON-MESH STRUCTURE that looks like a lion-tamer's cage.



     Gates open. THE PAINTED WALKERS are thrust inside the cage.
     Their nooses are released. The gates are locked behind them.

      EAD RED, alarmed by the color of DEAD BLACK's face, reaches
     out and gently touches the paint. Its fingers come away with
     blackened tips.



      lack follows suit, staining its fingers red. Black licks its   
     hand, spitting when it identifies not blood, but something      
     distasteful.                                                    
     BOOKIES drift among the spectators, taking bets with fists

CLANG! Another gate opens in the cage. A hush falls as
everyone awaits what will come. Including the Dead Men, who
gaze with anticipation at the opening. What comes is...



 ..A WOMAN! Alive, badly bruised, her dress in tatters.
Despite tarnish, she still looks sexy. Last night she was a

                                                               

hooker known as SLACK. Now she's meat in a lion cage.

         Jesus fucking Christ.



The gate SLAMS shut. The Dead Things walk toward the woman.



Riley rushes off. Charlie follows.

 lack backs up, hits the wall of the cage and, terrified,
starts to circle its iron perimeter. The Dead Men flank her.   
Black is the first to touch her. The crowd HOWLS.



 lack's terror turns to determination. She punches Black
three times in the face. The Thing recoils as she glides out
of its grasp.



RILEY and CHARLIE reach the BRUISERS who took their weapons.

         In a little while.                                     
In the ring, BLACK reaches for SLACK again. With one            
lightning-fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it
flying into Red's arms. Red shoves Black aside.



Black makes another try for the woman. Red grabs its rival.
This time Black hangs on to Red's shirt. The two twirl around
in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match.                   
Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb.
She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES
with the force of...                                            
...Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh.                         
On their way back through the arena, RILEY and CHARLEY push
through the crowd, trying to reach the center ring. A GOON      
steps in front of them.                                         

                   GOON                                         

         No guns in here!                                       
Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on.

S                                                               





                                                                

 lack continues to climb the cage, almost out of reach, but
Black grabs one of her ankles, pulling her down and slamming
her to the ground.



Black hunkers, drooling, over Slack. As it is about to bite,    
RAT-A-TAT! A short burst from Riley's M-16 shatters Black's     

                                                                

collarbone. Cheekbone. Skull. The Thing drops.



Red lunges for Slack. Riley kills it with another short BURST. 



 he crowd PANICS, stampeding toward the exit. Suddenly MORE
BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by...



...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of
the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a
steady bead on a target...Charlie. Chihuahua pulls his
trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16.



Just as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES
PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock
misses Charlie completely.



Riley runs to the cage, where Slack stands, trembling, just
on the other side of the bars.

                   R

She nods gratefully.



 hihuahua is still on his feet. And now he is really pissed.
Not because of the holes in his gut, but because...




                   CHIHUAHUA

         My suit! You fucked up my new suit!



Riley turns to Chihuahua, but doesn't have time to lift the
M-16 before...BLAM! The little man FIRES at him. Slack
delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing, sending    
Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from...



...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK!
Spun around by the impact, she falls face down.



Chihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets
PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps
coming, keeps FIRING, until...



...A SINGLE SHOT from Charlie's .45 shatters his skull. He
drops like a broken pinata.




                                                               

Riley looks up, seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns. Chihuahua's
GOONS. For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is
going to break out. But before it does...




                    POLICEMAN (O.S.)                           

         Hold it!

.                                                              

 ..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons.     
Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest
gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor.
He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects
worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple.




                   SLACK

         I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT!



Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting
position. Her right arm is BLEEDING, up near the shoulder.




                   SLACK (CONT'D)

          ucker got my right arm. I'm a lefty.



They look into each other's eyes.                              

                   RILEY

     A POLICEMAN steps over.                                          

                        POLICEMAN

              The hell happened here?




                        RILEY

              Somebody shot the little fat man.




                        POLICEMAN

              Yeah, I see that. You're under
              arrest.




     INT. BOARD ROOM - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY

     A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference
     room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below.
     Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a
     conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows.




                         ILHOUETTED MAN

              How was Uniontown?




                          CHOLO

              Dead.




                        SILHOUETTED MAN


                                                                      

              Death intrudes on us even in the
              Green, I'm afraid. I heard about                        
              what happened with my neighbors.                        

                                                                      

              I'm grateful for your help.




                          CHOLO


                                                                      

                  brought you back some presents.



     Cholo opens the case of champagne. He pulls a bottle out,        
     untwists the wire, and uses his strong thumbs to pop the         
     cork. FOAM runs.                                                 

                        CHOLO (CONT'D)

               ou probably want a glass, don't
              you? Sure, a high-toned man likes
              to drink out of a glass.



     Cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard, pours champagne
     into it, and brings it, overflowing, to the Silhouetted Man.




                        CHOLO

              I got something else, too.



     Cholo tears open the box of Cohibas. He picks up two cigars,
     bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back
     to the Silhouetted Man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting
     them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.

         Thank you.




                   CHOLO

         No, thank you! Twenty grand. That's
         what I got comin' for last night. I
         never bothered to pick it up.

                   S


                       ILHOUETTED MAN

         You didn't?




                   CHOLO

         Nope. I left it in the bank. Your
         bank. With all my other dough.
          rom all those other nights. I got
         enough now to buy me a place.




                                                              


                   SILHOUETTED MAN

         You mean here? In the Green?                         
The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively
dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down
the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper          
champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling
politely at Cholo.




                   KAUFMAN

         I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but
         there's a very long waiting list.




                      CHOLO

         How long?




                   KAUFMAN

         This is an extremely desirable
         location. Space is limited.




                   CHOLO

         You mean restricted.




                   KAUFMAN

         Well, I do have a board of
         directors, a membership committee
         that has to approve...



A wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over Cholo's face.

                   C


                    HOLO

         I guess it takes more than money to

                        KAUFMAN

              Take my advice. Withdraw your funds
              from the bank and spend them
              somewhere else.




                        CHOLO

              (Quietly) Don't do this to me. Don't
              do this to me.




                         AUFMAN

              I'm sorry, but...




                        CHOLO

              No, no, no. Three years! Three
              years I been cleaning up after you,                    
              taking out your garbage, and you
              tell me I'm not good enough? You're
              the one who's no good. You are no
              fucking good. And you are gonna let
              me in. You know why? Because I know
              what goes on around here. How many
              of your fucking "members" know
              what's in that garbage I take out
              for you?



     Cholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar.




                        CHOLO (CONT'D)


               OU'LL LET ME IN OR I'LL...




     Cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. Kaufman,
     who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling.




                        KAUFMAN

              Maybe we should talk about this
              when you're less excited.



     Kaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY
     GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops
     one of the guards at the door.




                        KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

               Softly) I won't be needing this
              man any more.

      HE SECURITY GUARDS lead CHOLO down the stairs. Cholo WHIRLS
     like a Ninja. He SLUGS one guard, kicks another in the groin,
     the third in the face, and escapes through a fire door.

     RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage
     the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has
     brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley.
     CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.




                        RILEY

              (To Slack) Why you? In that arena.
              Why did the little fat man throw
              you in with those things?




                        SLACK

              It wasn't the little man. It was the
              big man. The man upstairs. He's got
              his fingers in everything down here.
              If you can drink it, shoot it up,
              fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs
              to him. He's just seein' that we get
              a few cheap kicks so we don't go
              thinkin' too hard about why he's
              eating steak and the rest of us are
              lucky to get the bones.




                        RILEY

              Same question. Why you?




                         SLACK

              They found out I was working with
              Mulligan and his people. Tired of
              eatin' off Cbones.




                         HARLIE

              What can you do? Every place is the                    
              same.

              Places with people. I'm gonna find
              me a place where there ain't no
              people. North. Canada.




                        SLACK

               ith you.




                         CHARLIE

              He won't. Riley likes to be alone.
              He might take me. Cuzz havin' me
              around is pretty much the same as
              bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley)

         I can shoot. And I can be pretty
         fucking useful. I had training. I
         was gonna join the Army. Up the
         Green. Till somebody figured I'd be
         a better hooker than a soldier.




                   RILEY

         I don't need to hear your story.
         Everybody's got a story, and I'm
         tired of hearin' them all!




                   SLACK

         What's your story, Riley?



They look at each other, clearly attracted.

                    ILEY

         I said everybody has a story. That
         was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy
         was a preacher. Mama kept the
         house. School. Engineering. Nothing
         bad ever happened to me...(turning
         away)...till everything changed.




                    LACK

         Everything changed for all of us.
         Whether we had a story or not.




                                                                

A SOUND outside the window. Charlie glances through the bars.




                     CHARLIE

         Hey...



Riley and Slack look out the window. FOUR SECURITY MEN are      
chasing MULLIGAN into the alley outside. They drive him like    
an animal against a wall, club him, and drag him away.




                     RILEY

         Mulligan.



RILEY instinctively reaches through the window's bars, but
there's nothing he can do. It's a helpless feeling.




                    HARLIE

         What are they gonna do? Kill him?                      

                   SLACK                                        

         Not right away. First, they'll try                     
         to get what they can out of him.                       
         About people like me.                                  
Riley puts his hand on her back.

     CRANE DOWN FROM A FADED SIGN, TONY'S AUTOMANIA, high above
     what was once a car dealership, but is now a fenced-in DEPOT
     full of VEHICLES. A huge WHITE FACE with black cartoon eyes     

                                                                     

     POPS into view, attached to a TEN-FOOT-TALL BODY emblazoned
     TONY BALONEY. It's one of those vinyl ADVERTISING DUMMIES
     that does the hula as air pumps through it. Tony's arms wave
     wildly, like a giant zombie, comic yet oddly unnerving as...



     BLAM! BLAM! Bullets hit it in the face and neck. GUS, a young
     soldier, and his partner BARRETT, are shooting outside the
     SALES OFFICE of the car-lot-turned-depot. A sign is printed
     on the window. "BEST DEALS IN TOWN AND THAT'S NO BALONEY!"

                         ARRETT

     The steel doors under the "SUBWAY" sign open and CHOLO strides 
     out with his TEAM. A DEPOT GUARD steps forward as the doors    
     close and lock automatically behind them.

     Cholo reaches down, but not into his pocket. For his gun.        
     Just before he draws it...SHOTS ring out.

              Double or nothing?




                        BARRETT

              Sure.



     GUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he    
     is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back.




                        GUS

              Quit scratching around back there.
              You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.




                        BARRETT

              I'm just standin' here. I'm not
              doin' nothing.



     The SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot.
     Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot    
     and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line.

     T                                                                

      here's nothing there. Nothing but BRANCHES being slapped by     
     erratic gusts of wind.



     Barrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position,
     jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals...    
     A DEAD THING within arm's length.

     Barrett FIRES! The dead thing DROPS OUT OF FRAME, REPLACED BY    
     ANOTHER. BLAM! Barrett SHOOTS again. This creature collapses.    
     It is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as...        
     BLAM! The top of Barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot.    
     The rifle was fired by BIG DADDY. The barrel is still smoking.   
     In the darkness behind him stands NUMBER NINE. Behind Number     
     Nine are the SHUFFLING SHADOWS of many more dead things.         

     GUS SCREAMS.

      HOLO and his team sprint across the lot to DEAD RECKONING.      

                                                                      

     A GUNNER at a machine-gun battery opens fire on the WALKERS.

     THE WALKING DEAD march through MACHINE GUN FIRE behind their     
     "leader". BIG DADDY. He is the first to reach the fence          
     surrounding the lot. Pushing against the wire, he is soon        
     joined by NUMBER NINE. Then OTHERS. The FENCE COLLAPSES. The
     Dead Things SWARM into the depot.



     VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING pulls out. Rumbling over the section      
     of fencing the zombies pushed down, it drives into the night.

     SOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly.    
     NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat.       
     The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat      
     and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he           
     presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging      
     Number Nine's fingers on the trigger.                            
     RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine         
     fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The           
     soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the        
     barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the          
     pavement to...                                                   
     ...the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly,
     chest, and, finally, head. He drops.                             
     ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her

     KAUFMAN RIPS a TURKEY LEG off a cooked bird on a platter in

              could do a great deal of damage if
              he were to aim them at this city.




                        RILEY

              Why don't you just send out your

         I don't want to lose them. I could
         send five hundred men against that
         thing and they'd all come back in
         body bags. It's your vehicle. Cholo
         was your man. You might be able to
         get close enough to...do what has
         to be done. (Refilling his scotch)                   
         Do this for me and I'll grant you                    
         something in return. Residence in                    
         the Green.                                           

                   RILEY

         Not me. That's what Cholo wanted,                    
         and you didn't give it to him, did                   
         you? That's why he's out there                       
         waving a cannon at your ass.                         
Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him   
with a glimmer of respect.                                    

                   RILEY (CONT'D)                             

         Give me one of those vehicles, over

         ammunition to go north.




                   KAUFMAN

         But...there's nothing up north.




                   RILEY

         That's the idea.




                   KAUFMAN

         Alright. You've named your price.

     DEAD RECKONING RUMBLES along a dark street, plowing into a       
     DERELICT CAR, knocking it aside and rolling it down a small      
     embankment, pinning THREE DEAD THINGS beneath.

     BIG DADDY steps out of the darkness, watching the lights of      
     DEAD RECKONING recede. He hears desperate SQUEALING coming       

                                                                      

     from under the toppled car.



     He lumbers down the embankment. Pushes on one of the upturned

     road. Grunts.                                                    
     NUMBER NINE and OTHERS OF BIG DADDY'S GATHERING FORCE hurry
     to the car. They push. The car rolls over, freeing THE THREE     
     DEAD THINGS. One of them used to be a BUTCHER. Still wearing     

                                                                      

     a blood-stained apron, carrying a meat cleaver, he looks at
     Big Daddy with something resembling gratitude.

     climbing on a wall twenty feet away.

Slack ties her hair back with a bandana. Checks her gun clip.

     The steel doors to the subway tunnel open. RILEY and his TEAM   
     step out. The depot has been DEVASTATED. FIRES BURNING.         
     FENCES DOWN. Only TONY BALONEY moves, still waving spookily.

                        C

                        RILEY

              Cholo didn't do all this.



     Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the
     depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the
     clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS.

         Stenches have been at this place.



He leads the way into the depot, his M-16 at the ready.        
Behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. Everyone   
speaks in HUSHED tones.                                        

                   MANOLETE

         When the truck pulled out, it must
         have knocked the fence down. That's
         how they got in.




                   RILEY

         That fencing was pushed in from
         outside.




                   TEAHOUSE

         You know how many stenches it
         would take to do that?

         There's a thousand of them out
         there for every one of us.




                   CHARLIE

         Good thing we're smarter.




                   SLACK

         Look who's talkin'.




                   RILEY

         They're getting smart. I saw it in

                                                               

         Uniontown, last time out. They're
         learning how to work together.                        
Thoughts darken. So does the SMOKE, which billows thicker,
virtually blinding the team. SOUNDS come. The MOANING of the   
WIND. The POPPING of burnt metal and wood.                     

                   TEAHOUSE

         What do they want?                                    
Slack looks back as she walks. The zombies have taken down     
another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a        
suburb. Beyond which is the river. Beyond which is the glow    
of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE.

Teahouse pulls a Motorola from his belt. Just as he tosses
it to Riley, they hear...GROWLING!



 he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle,
their backs to each other, guns searching for a target.
Darting eyes peer into the void. MORE NOISES emanate from       
somewhere. Everywhere. Slowly...



...Charlie unstraps his Remington. Licks his thumb. Wets the
sight of the rifle.

BLAM! Charlie FIRES! A single shot into the black smoke.




                   SLACK

         The hell you shooting at?




                   CHARLIE

         That thing.

A

  DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it
grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls
away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the    
left side of the Thing's forehead.




                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)

          ff-center. But I got him.



The Thing relaxes its grip and drops at Slack's feet.




                    ANOLETE

         (Hysterical) There's more of `em out                   
         there. I can hear `em. THERE'S MORE!



There are SHUFFLING SOUNDS in the smoke. Manolete backs away.
Pillsbury grabs him. Slaps him, hard, across the face.

     A TROOPER, equally alarmed, is reporting.




                        TROOPER

              Wiped out! That's what he said!

     RILEY and his TEAM move through DRIFTING SMOKE. VEHICLES are
     scattered about. They stop at the T-BIRD. There are no keys    
     in the ignition.




                        CHARLIE

              Gotta go get the keys, Riley.

Riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash.

of a bridal gown. The fabric seems to glow in the smoke.       
The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE. We see it coming. No one

Charlie fired, CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before

                   MANOLETE


         I GOT IT! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!




Riley leads the team into the T-Bird. Manolete starts to get    
out from under the dash. As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by     
the door...

         God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?!



Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt. Shockingly,
the ARM SPRINGS BACK, THUMPING against Teahouse's face! A
twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping
the limb loosely attached to...

itself, it BITES a large filet out of Teahouse's arm. CHARLIE

 anolete climbs up behind the wheel and...VROOOOOM!...pedal
to the metal he pulls out of the depot. Slack glances at
Teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to Riley.      

                   SLACK

         (Softly) How long does he have?




                   RILEY

         I had a brother. Real brother, by
         birth. Bit. Hung on for six days.
         Before he turned. I was the one had
         to shoot him.




                   SLACK

         And you said nothin' bad ever
         happened to you.




                   RILEY

         That happened to my brother.

     KAUFMAN paces with a cigar, passing SUTHERLAND, STYLES,
     and CLIFF.




                          AUFMAN

              I recognize that some of you are
              concerned. We've been threatened by
              a disgruntled employee. I've sent
              people out to take care of the
              problem. However, should something
              go wrong, I want to assure you that
              measures have been taken. I've
              established outposts. With food and
              supplies to support us on our way.

                         LIFF

              On our way? To where?




                        KAUFMAN

              Alternate sites have been chosen.
              Air transport has been arranged.
              For us and our families. As well as
              necessary support personnel.




                        CLIFF

              What about all the others?



     Kaufman looks at Cliff, as if expecting him to understand.




                         AUFMAN

              All the others can be replaced.
               y others.




                         LIFF

              But...




                        KAUFMAN

              Cliff, let me talk to you for a
              moment.



     Kaufman leads Cliff into...




                                                      51.










...an alcove on the far side of the room, shutting two pocket
doors made of sandblasted glass. Sutherland and the others      
can't hear, but can see, Kaufman and Cliff in SILHOUETTE.       
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS: Kaufman leans close to Cliff,   
smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.                   

                   KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

         You interrupted me. I was just                         
         talking about how people can be
         replaced. You don't want to be
         replaced, do you?




                   CLIFF


         (

          Nervous) No.




                    KAUFMAN

         No, and I don't want to replace
         you. You have promise. A day may
         come when you earn yourself some
         responsibilities. Right now, the
         responsibilities are mine. All                         
         the responsibilities. It was my                        

                                                                

         ingenuity that took an old world
         and made it into something new. I                      
         put up fences to make it safe. I                       
         hired soldiers and paid for their
         training. I keep the people on the
         streets away from us by giving them
         their games and vices. It costs me
         money! But I spend it because the
         responsibility is mine! Now do you                     

                                                                

         understand "responsibility"?




                   CLIFF

         Yes, but...




                    KAUFMAN

         No buts.




                    CLIFF

         But...



Kaufman looks disappointed. Taking Cliff by the arm, smiling
again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. An
armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside.




                   KAUFMAN

         Take him out with the rest of the
         garbage. I won't be needing this
         man anymore.

     At the conference table, Sutherland sees the light coming in
     from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as
     the Security Guard drags Cliff away.

     Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the

     splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at...

     through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that       
     Slack is effected by the desolation she sees.

              How long since you been out here?




                        SLACK

              Never been out. Lived in the city
              since...it was a regular city.

              yourself useful. Right now what I
              could use is for you to pull over.



      he does. The T-Bird stops along a road bordered by a MARSH    
     thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and
     points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE.




                        RILEY

              I made a deal with your boss. Find
              Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from                 
              blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do
              it, I don't want people to get hurt.
              Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry.
              That's where I stop. I didn't ask him                 
              for much, just guns, ammo, and a car.
              I've got the guns. I've got the ammo.
              And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm
              gonna have the best fucking car                       
              that's ever been built, and I'm
              taking it to Canada. If any of you
              don't like that idea...



     Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete
     looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are
     slogging through the marsh.

Pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again.




                    ILEY

         Charlie, keep these two covered.



Charlie pulls his .45.                                          
Riley turns around his seat, glancing down again at the "Game
Boy" in his palm. The RED DOT has moved on to ANOTHER MAP.

Slack pulls out.                                                

                   SLACK

         This is what you were thinking
         about all along. You got me out
         here figuring I'm a boy scout, and
         now you're telling me we're just

         No. I like the way you think.




                    HARLIE

         I like the way he thinks, too.
         Just look at me you can tell I
         like the way he thinks.




                   RILEY

         Take another right.

Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT   
shifts onto another MAP.

     DEAD RECKONING stops on a long road, at the end of which

     Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A

     outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees...    
     ...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still       
     wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's

     ONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping
     out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot        
     where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking   
     his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind.         
     The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the    
     Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows.                
     Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then,     
     with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall.      
     Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing,    
     waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one    
     good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it.                                
     He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He    
     tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth    
     is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of            
     transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since    
     Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the

     A knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too      
     greasy to be important. SUTHERLAND is outside.

     The unmanned SEARCHLIGHT scans the yard, casting intermittent   
     shadows.                                                        

                        SCAR

              This place is important. The men                       
              here wouldn't just walk out.                           

                        FOXY                                         

              Maybe they had no choice.                              
     FOXY and SCAR move toward a large STORAGE BUILDING where a      
     door swings in the night breeze, SLAPPING alarmingly against    
     the wall. Beyond the opening is a BLACK MAW, like a velvet      
     curtain, past which nothing can be seen.                        

                        FOXY (CONT'D)                                

              There could be stenches in there.

                                                           59.










     Scar nervously pulls out a flashlight. As he CLICKS on the       
     BEAM, he loses his grip. The flashlight drops to the ground.     
     Scar reaches for it. His fingers tip it and it spins. The        
     beam WASHES across his shoes. Then Foxy's shoes. Then finds...   
     ...ONE OTHER SHOE. Someone else's. Gasping, Scar grabs the       
     flashlight, shining the beam up onto what should be a leg,       
     but there's nothing left above its bloody shin.                  
     PLIP! PLOP! PLIP! Beads of BLOOD hit the floor, dropping
     from the DARK FIGURE of a SOLDIER who is approaching. Scar       
     aims the flashlight at the figure's face, recognizing...         

                        SCAR                                          

              Brubaker! You okay? Where's the                         
              other guys? What happened here?                         

                                                                      

     Brubaker keeps coming. He has BULLET HOLES in his chest, but
     they're not what's dripping blood. It's another half-eaten       
     FOOT that he's carrying. BRUBAKER IS DEAD. Foxy shoots him.      
     Foxy and Scar move into a hangar-like space. Pitch black.        
     Except for the mote-filled BEAM from Scar's flashlight, which    

                                                                      

     illuminates a supply of enormous cannon shells, lined up on
     storage shelves. THE "JOHNSONS".                                 
     SIX DEAD SOLDIERS are hunkered in the shadows, EATING the
     REMAINS of OTHER DEAD SOLDIERS.                                  




                                                                      

     Foxy grimly raises his weapon. As he squeezes the trigger,
     the sound of the gunfire OVERLAPS into...                        




84                                                               84

     More and more heads break the surface. The water FILLS with

     RILEY and HIS TEAM wait in the shadows of the driveway they

Look out there.                                 




                                                                














                                                                








                                                                














                                                         69.










Riley looks where SLACK is pointing. From across the river      
comes a flickering ORANGE GLOW.                                 
Riley moves to a spot where he can see between the houses on
the hillside. In the distance, FIRE rises from the city.        
Cholo sits up, cackling.                                        

                   CHOLO

         I didn't have to blow the fucking                      
         place up. Somebody else did for me!                    

                   RILEY                                        

         (Stunned) The stenches. They got                       
         across the river. They got across                      
         the fucking river. (To the others)                     
         Get him inside.                                        
PILLSBURY steps in and lifts Cholo easily to his feet.          




                                                                


                   CHOLO

         Wait, wait, wait. What are we                          
         doin'? Where we goin'?                                 

                   RILEY                                        

         Back to the city.                                      

                   CHOLO

         Not this horse. You got the T-Bird?                    

                                                                

         I'll take that.

         Me, too.



FOXY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING and stands at Cholo's side.    
Riley, Slack, and Pillsbury climb aboard. Riley looks down at   
Cholo and Foxy.

                   CHOLO                                        

         Nah, you'd never let me have any                       
         fun.

      INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

      RILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin       
      where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow.                         
      SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back
      her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean      
      the blood off Riley's neck.                                      
      He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture.      

                         SLACK

               Almost lost you there.                                  

                          RILEY                                        

               I don't get lost so easy. (To                           
               PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across                         
               the water.




                         PRETTY BOY                                    


                                                                       

               The bridges into the city are all
               bricked up.                                             




                                                                       

      PRETTY BOY hits a button. A MAP appears on a MONITOR, showing
      the "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" bordered by the rivers and the             
      barricaded bridges spanning them.                                

                         SLACK                                         

               We could blast our way through.                         

                         RILEY                                         

               Don't want to. If the stenches got                      

                                                                       

               in, there's a war going on in the
               city. We take any of those bridges                      
               we'll end up right in the middle                        
               of it.                                                  
      Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the           
      natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle.         

                         RILEY (CONT'D)

               We've gotta come in above the                           
               throat.                                                 
      His finger continues down the monitor to "THE THROAT" at the
      base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the      
      two rivers.

      CLOSE ON: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW, aghast.     
      LICKS OF FIRE reflect on the glass. SOUNDS OF WAR can be        
      heard from far below.

      In the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS      
      swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven
      from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things.



      CLOSE ON BIG DADDY. Who looks back and forth, as if torn, at
      the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, at the violence in the streets,
      back at the building, back at the streets. A SOLDIER fires at 
      him! Misses. Big Daddy raises his rifle and blows him away.

      EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT




      CHOLO and FOXY run up the road to THE T-BIRD. Seeing a WALKER   
      lurking ahead, they duck into the dark cover of the trees.




                            HOLO

               I got it.



      WFFFFT! Cholo picks off the Walker with his crossbow.           

                          HOLO (CONT'D)

               Come on, let's go.



      He slaps a hand on Foxy's back.



       XCEPT IT'S NOT FOXY! It's ANOTHER WALKER that has moved
      between the two men. It grabs the hand that slapped him and
      BITES it.




                          HOLO


               AHHH...FUCK!




      Foxy, a few yards away, whirls, aiming his gun at the Walker.
      Cholo is faster. With no time to reload, in agony, he pulls     
      a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH     
      THE WALKER'S FACE AND SKULL. The Walker falls. So does an       
      ominous silence.




                          HOLO (CONT'D)

               I can't fucking believe it. (A sad
               chuckle) Nothin' works out. It's                       
               like...the world is spinning around                    
               and we're just...caught in the                         
               wind. Nothin' works out. Some damn                     
               thing always comes around the

      Foxy aims his rifle Fat Cholo's forehead. Their eyes connect.




                          OXY

               Your choice.



      For a moment, Cholo looks despondent. Then he forces a smile.




                         CHOLO

               No, don't shoot. (A dark chuckle)
                 always wanted to see how the
               other half lives.



      Foxy lowers his gun.

      A CONTROL BOOTH is built into the superstructure of the         
      bridge, about fifteen feet off the ground, on DEAD              
      RECKONING'S side of the river.

      RILEY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING. SLACK is right behind him.

               Get back in there. What are you                         
               doing?                                                  
      BLAM! She shoots a WALKER that has come out of the night.

      RILEY ducks under a caution gate at the entrance to the          

                                                                       

      bridge and starts across the roadway. Behind him...



      ...SLACK and CHARLIE stand, weapons ready, eyes alert for        

                                                                       

      danger.



      As Riley runs...                                                 
      ...SOMETHING SKITTERS across the road, chasing him. Not a        
      zombie. Much smaller. A RIVER RAT.                               
      Charlie draws his REMINGTON. Wets the sight with his thumb.      

      BLAM!                                                            

      Riley stops running. Looks back to see what's being shot.




                         SLACK                                         

               You missed.                                             

                         CHARLIE

               Nope. I blew its ass off.                               
      The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet       

      IT'S STILL RUNNING!                                              


                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)

               Just didn't hit it in the head.

               (Realizing) Jesus. It's dead.                          

                         CHARLIE

               They all are.                                          
      SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS.     
      Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry         
      closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off.                
      The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto
      a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow.   
      Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before...                    
      ...SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her!      
      She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to...          
      ...the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie    
      fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD

      RILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting       
      danger within. He steps through the opening...                  
      ...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over      
      his face as he moves toward a RED SWITCH that activates a       

                                                                      

      generator. He flips it. The motor roars to life.



      He turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed. It     

                                                                      

      GROANS from disuse as he pulls it.

      RED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night.       
      The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across     
      the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly.

      THREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge.      
      SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned     
      bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether        
      holds it within inches of the shore.                            
      Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but...



      ...rats SNAP at her hands. Slack recoils, but keeps cutting.    
      Finally, the rope frays, enough for the boat to pull free.

      Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull. No way to steer.    
      No paddles. The current carrying her away.                      

                           CHARLIE

               Slack!

      Hearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window    
      and sees...                                                     
      ...SLACK being taken downstream.

      RILEY bursts out of the booth, only to be confronted by...      

                                                                      

      ...the BRIDGEKEEPER. Drooling. Dead. It grabs Riley, pushing
      his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge.      




                                                                      

      Riley struggles. Bests the creature. Spins him around toward
      the gearworks and...                                            




                                                                      

      ...SSSNIPPPP! THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD is scissored off! It
      drops with a PLUNK into the river below.

      EXT. RIVER - NIGHT




      SLACK, adrift on the boat, lies prone at the bow and begins     

                                                                      

      to paddle with her hands. One of which hits something long
      and slimy. It looks like a snake!                               
      But it's not. It's only a moss-covered rope. Slack grabs on.
      Pulls hand over hand. It seems to take forever for the rope     
      to become taut.                                                 

      A FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER!




      Slack SCREAMS.                                                  
      It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats    
      off on the current.                                             
       he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore.      
      Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until...              
      ...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding    
      herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The    
      river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley      
      and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's   
      in the war zone.

      THE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles       
      up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE.

      Riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and...         
      ...LEAPS across the narrowing gulf to the other side.            
      He lands. Falls. Rolls. Gets to his feet and runs toward
      Slack and the city.

      EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" - NIGHT




      SLACK runs past hysterical PEOPLE toward the FIDDLER'S GREEN     

                                                                       

      HIGH-RISE. BRIAN, Mulligan's young son, rushes by her in a
      panic. Slack grabs him.

                         BRIAN

               We can't get out! There's no way out!




                         SLACK

               There will be. Come with me.




                         BRIAN

               Daddy! Daddy's still locked up.                         
      Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by          
      canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As
      MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole...               
      ...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the
      ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls"
      roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.

      S

       ome of the   pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the
      street. One   of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks
      against the   feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker
      is engulfed   in flames.



      Big Daddy looks at the Walker with sadness. He lifts his
      rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head.         




      B

      Big Daddy walks to the manhole. TOOLS are strewn around it,     
      pickaxes, sledges, chainsaws, and a pneumatic hammer which is
      lying on the street...RATTATATTAT...still running.



      Big Daddy looks at the FIDDLER'S GREEN SKYSCRAPER. His goal.    
      Finally in reach.                                               
      He looks down at the pneumatic hammer, and picks it up by the
      handle. With the heavy tool vibrating in its hand, Big Daddy
      walks toward the building.



      He doesn't get very far before the hammer's electrical cord
      is pulled out of the extension it's plugged into. The hammer
      stops running. Big Daddy looks at it. Puzzles over its
      stillness for a moment. Then...



      ...he looks at the building. At its doors, abandoned by         
      guards. Doors that are made of glass.



      The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddy's temple     
      by a MILITIAMAN.



       UDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA! The Militiaman FLIES BACK. It wasn't he

                                                                      

      who fired. It was NUMBER NINE, standing nearby with her M-16.
      The Militiaman lies on the ground, his dead eyes staring at
      Number NINE in utter surprise.



      Seeing what has happened, ANOTHER SOLDIER grabs a grenade,      
      pulls the pin, and is about to toss it at Big Daddy when...



      ...his HAND IS CUT OFF at the wrist by a meat clever held by
      THE BUTCHER. The Soldier's hand, still clutching the grenade,   

                                                                      

      PLOPS into the street. The Soldier looks down in horror, then
      collapses on top of his hand. A MUFFLED EXPLOSION makes jelly
      of his mid-section.



      Big Daddy continues to walk toward the building, carrying the
      pneumatic hammer, as OTHER DEAD THINGS collect sledges,
      pickaxes, lengths of pipe, and follow their leader.

      KAUFMAN and KNIPP, carrying the Prada duffles, rush out of an
      elevator with FOUR SECURITY GUARDS. Kaufman carries a gun.

       hey race into the street level of the three-story ATRIUM.
      Chopin LILTS, caged birds SING. RESIDENTS SCREAM, running
      crazily in all directions.



      A bank of GLASS DOORS leading to the street is under assault
      by WALKERS, ten deep.

                   KAUFMAN

         They can't get in. Downstairs.                         
         The car.                                               
The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The
Other Three follow.




                   KAUFMAN (CONT'D)

          et back here! GET BACK HERE!



Kaufman FIRES THREE ROUNDS at the men! He's not a marksman,
but ONE of the GUARDS is WINGED. Whirls around and levels his   
M-16 at Kaufman.




                   SECURITY GUARD


         YOU STUPID OLD FUCK!




He's about to fire when Knipp steps in front of Kaufman.




                   KNIPP

         DON'T SHOOT! (Grabbing Kaufman's
         gun hand) Boss? Don't you shoot,
         neither. We're all on the same

                   S

         side. Least we're supposed to be.




                    ECURITY GUARD

         I'm on my own side now.



The Guard takes off after his comrades.




                   CHOLO (O.S.)

         Need some help, Mister K.?



Kaufman spins around to see CHOLO walking toward him across     
the atrium.




                   CHOLO (CONT'D)

           been bit, Mister K. I'm a dead
         man, so I don't care about nothin'
         no more. Still care about you,
         though. I wanna make sure you come
         to the same end as me.



 LANG! CLANG! CLANG! The Dead Things at the glass doors are
POUNDING now with shovels, pickaxes, and lengths of pipe.




                   CHOLO (CONT'D)

          hey're going to get you, Mister K.
           want them to get you.



Kaufman raises his gun and aims at Cholo, who aims back with    
his crossbow.

          ut it down, old man, unless you'd
         rather die right now.



BIG DADDY appears outside the doors. Uses his pneumatic
hammer to POUND at the safety glass.



 aufman can't take it anymore. He bolts for a stairway door.
Cholo shoots. An arrows hits Kaufman in the back of his left    
calf. Kaufman sprawls, dropping both his bag of money and his   
gun, which skitters Kaway. Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman.   

                    NIPP

         Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let
         us get out of here.




                   CHOLO


                                                                

         (Calmly reloading) You can go,
         Knipp, but not him.




                                                                

Kaufman shakes Knipp off. His gun is ten feet away. He heads
for it. Dragging himself on hands and knees.



CRUNCH! The chisel on Big Daddy's pneumatic hammer is the
first tool to PENETRATE the doors. The glass doesn't shatter;
it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin
plasticine coating. ALARM BELLS SOUND!



Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into
something that looks different, Big Daddy drops the pneumatic
hammer and reaches out. The glass is different. It's soft.
Flexible. Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through.



Kaufman has almost reached his gun. Cholo shoots another        
arrow. This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder.                   

                    AUFMAN

         You fucking spic bastard!




                   CHOLO

         I think we should talk when you're
         a little less excited.



Kaufman has a will of iron. He keeps going, gritting his
teeth against the pain, reaching out for his gun, as...



CRUNCH! CRUNCH! CRUNCH! More tools PENETRATE the doors. More
HANDS POKE through.



 aufman looks at his worst nightmare...Dead Things ripping
their way through the cobwebbed doors, invading his temple.

      The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to    
      lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds.                               
       ost of the shots miss. TWO hit Cholo, one in the belly, one
      in the heart. He is slammed against the wall, his glazing
      eyes staring up into the atrium, the place he so desired.
      It's the last thing he sees before he keels over, dead.          
      Knipp pulls Kaufman onto his feet. They look up to see...



      BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and
      FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing       
      DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but      
      it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose.



      Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's
      not dead. Kaufman fires again. CLICK! He's out of ammo.

                         K


                          NIPP

               Boss. We gotta get outa here!



      Knipp pulls Kaufman to a stairway door. They rush inside. The
      moment they're out of sight, the Walkers forget about them,
      moving on into the atrium. All except Big Daddy. That rage is
      still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door.        




135                                                           135

      KEYS TURN in the locks of cell doors, which SLACK and BRIAN
      pull open. MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES emerge. Mulligan     
      embraces his son and looks gratefully at Slack.                  

                         MULLIGAN

               (To his men) Let's go get our guns,

       ILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees...



      ...the "THROAT", where much of the CITY'S POPULATION is
      trapped, herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers
      of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them.
      There's no escape. People are being TORN apart and EATEN. The 
      fencing SPARKS as bodies touch it and are ELECTROCUTED.
      Terrible SCREAMS fill the air.

      Riley hears the distinctive ROAR of DEAD RECKONING'S engines,
      the CLATTER of its treads. He moves toward the sound as...



       ..a DEAD THING looms three feet away. Riley lifts his pistol
      and puts a shell through the thing's skull. Blood flies,
      taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is BACKLIT by...



      ...the glare of DEAD RECKONING'S approaching headlights. The
      dead thing falls to the road, where...



      ...it is turned to apple butter by Dead Reckoning's enormous
      treads. Riley stands right in the vehicle's path.

      THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY looms larger and larger as the
      vehicle closes in. He doesn't move. PRETTY BOY tries to turn
      the wheel. Too late. RILEY DISAPPEARS!




                          HARLIE

               (Pure anguish) RILEY!



      Three seconds later, Riley's figure comes scrambling across     
      the windshield, climbing up toward...




      EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

      ...the two fourteen-inch cannons on the vehicle's turrets.




                          ILEY

               We gotta blow the fences!




                         PRETTY BOY (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)

               Johnson's are loaded!




                         RILEY

               Yeah, but they're capped!                              
      The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped.
      DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of
      the cannon barrels.



      WHAM! A WALKER grabs him by the leg from the road. Riley
      blasts him with his .45. As OTHER WALKERS approach, he shoots
      them with one hand, Rusing the other to uncap the cannon.




                           ILEY

               Number One is clear! I'm going for

      Riley turns. The road is now filled with WALKERS.



       tanding ASTRIDE the vehicle, riding it as if it were a
      living beast, Riley picks some of them of with his .45.         

      INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT


140                                                             140

      FOOTSTEPS ECHO as KNIPP, carrying one of the Prada duffles,
      helps the wounded KAUFMAN across an underground PARKING         
      GARAGE, a dark and spooky place, made more so by the SOUNDS
      of distant SCREAMING. Kaufman disdainfully SNAPS OFF the        
      shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder.                   
      The two men reach a stretch LINCOLN. Knipp BEEPS the doors
      open and they get inside, Knipp behind the wheel, Kaufman in
      the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a
      scotch from the built-in bar.



      Knipp starts the engine. The SOUND ECHOES big-time in the
      concrete tomb.




                          NIPP

               (Looking at the fuel gauge) We
                eed gas.



      Kaufman moans. Knipp steers the car slowly, carefully through
      the shadows, pulling in beside a GASOLINE PUMP near the base
      of a RAMP that leads up to the street. Knipp pushes a button
      that pops open the gas tank. He shuts the engine off and gets
      out, taking the keys, which have a Mag-Card attached to them.

      H

       e slides the Mag-Card into a slot, activating the pump. An
      LED scrolls "Thank you, Mr. Kaufman". Knipp pulls the nozzle.
      Freezes when he hears...



      ...FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. A DARK FIGURE is approaching through
      the shadows.



       nipp drops the nozzle. Ducks into the car. SLAMS the door.



      WHAM! A SINGLE HAND SMACKS against the driver-side window.



      A FACE leans in behind the hand. A face full of rage. BIG

      DADDY'S FACE.





                          AUFMAN

               Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!

                   KNIPP

         You didn't gimme no gun, sir.



Big Daddy moves to one of the rear windows. He can't see        
inside. The window is tinted. He returns to the clear           
windshield, looks back, at an angle, and sees Kaufman in the
rear compartment. Big Daddy recognizes him. From upstairs.      
It's the man who shot him.                                      
The Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump. His hand       
drops to the embroidery on its jump-suit..."Texaco". He moves   
deliberately toward the pump.




                   KAUFMAN

         Pull out! PULL OUT!

                   K


                    NIPP

         Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump.



Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement. Picks it up, feeling
the familiarity of it. Pulls the trigger. Gasoline squirts.
The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction.           




                                                                

Using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer, Big Daddy
POUNDS on the windshield, three times, before the SAFETY
GLASS COBWEBS. He POKES the nozzle through the flexible         
fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks. Gasoline FLOODS
into the car.




                   KNIPP (CONT'D)

          ord!



TCHUNG! Big Daddy pulls the driver side door open. As Knipp
tries to run, he is GRABBED by Big Daddy.




                   KNIPP (CONT'D)


          ORD!




Big Daddy looks at the butler. Sniffs him. Then flings him
aside. Knipp is not his prey. With a glance at Kaufman,
cowering in the back seat, Big Daddy slams the car door and,
surprisingly, walks away. Up the ramp toward the street.



The nozzle remains stuck in the "fabric" of the windshield.
Gasoline continues to flow into the car. Kaufman crawls into
the front seat, wincing from his wounds, and KICKS the nozzle
out of the window with his good leg, getting soaked with gas
in the process. He opens the door. Limps to the pump. Grabs
the keys. As he starts back toward the car...



...WHAM! SOMETHING is standing right in front of him. It's
one of the WALKING DEAD. It's...

          aufman shakes his head in disbelief.




                               KAUFMAN

                     N-no, y-you're dead. (Realization
                     dawning) Oh my God. You're dead!



         THE CHOLO THING reaches for Kaufman, vengeance in its eyes.



           aufman breaks for the driver's door. He never makes it. The
         Cholo Thing grabs him and SLAMS him down across the hood.
         Leans over him. Opens a drooling mouth. Kaufman whimpers.

         B                                                               

          RRRUMBLE-UMBLE-UMBLE! The SOUND of a bowling ball.



         Kaufman looks up. It's not a bowling ball. It's an OIL POT,
         rolled down the ramp by Big Daddy. Kaufman SCREAMS. The fire
         ball approaches the gas-soaked Lincoln, the gas-soaked
         Kaufman, and...



         ...WHOOOMPH! Kaufman and The Cholo Thing are IMMOLATED. The
         FIREBALL removes everything from sight, except a few floating
         HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS, burning in mid-air.



          HROUGH LICKS OF FLAME we see...Big Daddy is almost smiling.

                     blow the fences!                                    
         The CROWD screams and starts to clear the area.

      Riley leaps down. The instant he's clear...



      KA-BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. The ELECTRIFIED FENCES are BLOWN APART.



       n the dissipating SMOKE, RILEY is the first one through the
      opening. Within seconds, CITIZENS start toward it, heading
      the other way. Riley finds himself running against the tide.
      Searching. Desperately searching. Behind the surging crowd...



      ...WALKERS appear, grabbing people. Dropping them to the
      ground. Eating them.



       iley FIRES in all directions. WALKERS DROP around him. He       
      saves a WOMAN with a BABY...a YOUNG COUPLE...a PRIEST. CLICK.    
      He runs out of ammo. WALKERS close in. The situation seems

      PTOOOM! PTOOOM! FIREWORKS "BLOOM" in the sky.



       HE DEAD THINGS gaze upward, mesmerized.

      frozen like statues around him.                                  
      Other than the intermittent BOOM of the fireworks, SILENCE.

      ...both of them weaving a cautious path between the statues.     
      They reach each other and embrace, surrounded by dead things     
      that don't even know they are there.

      HAPLESS DEAD THINGS are MOWED DOWN the way they were back

      distant gunfire. He looks at Brian, standing at Mulligan's         
      side, his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead.       
      Riley shakes his head.

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
          Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.
          A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The
          unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                      When I was a little girl, my mother
                      would remind me each night before
                      bed to be sure to open my heart to
                      God, for he was kind, merciful and
                      just. Things changed after my
                      father left a few years later,
                      leaving her to raise me and my
                      brothers alone in a little place
                      out on the edge of the Mojave
                      Desert. She never talked about a
                      kind and merciful God again.
                      Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
                      Of a time when all the world would
                      be covered in darkness and the fate
                      of Mankind would be decided. One
                      night I finally got up the courage
                      to ask my mother why God had
                      changed, why was he mad at his
                      children. "I don't know," she
                      said, tucking the covers around me,
                      "I guess he just got tired of all
                      the bullshit."
          And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
          OUT, leaving us in:

          DARKNESS...
          A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
          SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.

          A BLOOD RED MOON
          reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
          smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
          something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
          coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!

          TWO BLACK BOOTS
          land hard in the water...and we're in:

          EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT

          A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
          pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
          he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
          been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
          deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
          fight.
          His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
          He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
          walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
          A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems
          to motivate him.
          Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
          toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
          time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
          SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
          He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
          dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
          past.
          Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
          MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
          Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
          sharp.
          Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
          chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
          TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
          As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
          WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
          and then...

          ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO

          WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
          The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
          The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.

          A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...

          ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...

          ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
          ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...

          CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,

          SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...

          

                                                                     3.

          

          

          

          EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
          of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
          across the street.

          "GUN & SPORT WORLD"

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the
          sound of RAIN, then...
          SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
          shower of glass.

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
          His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
          fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
          His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
          shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
          a living book. But the writing is in no language we
          recognize.
          He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
          OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.

          FRESH. BLOODY.
          He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
          and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
          cement floor around his feet.

          

          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER

          Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
          ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
          his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
          for this.
          Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
          Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
          Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.
          The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front
          doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get
          out of here?

          

                                                                         4.

          

          

          

          INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME

          Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
          BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
          The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.
          Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
          deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
          streetwalkers.

                              BURTON
                    Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
                    I wish I could take a match to this
                    city just so I could watch all
                    these motherfuckers burn.

                              ESTEVEZ

                        (LAUGHS)
                    A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
          Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.

                              BURTON
                    A fresh start. That's what this
                    place needs.
          He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
          they pass, picking them off one by one.

                                  BURTON
                    Pow!   Pow!     Pow!
          Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his
          partner, wary.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
                    happy we get to share beautiful
                    moments like this. They really
                    brighten my da--
          KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
          just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
          Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
          to see...

          

          EXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS

          Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly
          out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.

          

                                                                      5.

          

          

                              ESTEVEZ (O.S.)
                    Freeze!
          Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
          crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
          In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO
          CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.
          "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"
          The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.

                              MICHAEL
                        (sensing their unease:)
                    It's starting. There isn't much
                    time.
          The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
          the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.

                              BURTON
                    Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
                    now!
          Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Hands on your head!    On your head!
          Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.

                              BURTON
                    Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
          Michael slowly turns around.    Calm.
          Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
          FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
          decision made.
          And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
          In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
          helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
          Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
          with Burton.
          Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.

                              BURTON
                    Let `em go!

          

                                                                     6.

          

          

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Take the shot, Burton!

                              BURTON
                    I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
          Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
          throat like a skipping record.

                               ESTEVEZ
                    Burton!?
          THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the
          confusion.
          Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
          QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
          pressure were building inside him.
          And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH

          BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE

          CLOWN!
          His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
          in control.
          Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
          GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.

                              BURTON
                    What are you doing, Michael?   These
                    weren't your orders.
          Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    What did you say?
          Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.

                              MICHAEL
                    I'm following my own orders now.

                              BURTON
                    Then you will die along with the
                    child.

                              ESTEVEZ
                    Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
          BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,
          leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's
          faster, already FIRING back.
          Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window
          SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!

          

                                                                    7.

          

          
          And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.
          Smoke rising from his gun.
          With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags
          and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.
          He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the
          FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a
          wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

          

          JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)
          Bolts awake.   Breathing hard.   Covered with sweat.

          

          INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN

          Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped
          bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got
          shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.

          

          EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN

          A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
          eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
          trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
          decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
          trailers roof lines, marking the season.
          One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
          out into the cool western morning. Home.
          Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
          two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
          Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
          Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
          glows like a beacon in the darkness:

          "PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"
          A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.

                              CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    You okay, Jeep?
          Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
          twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep
          from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's
          strikingly beautiful.

          

                                                                8.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    Sorry to wake you, Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
                        (stepping out of the
                         trailer, hands on her

                         BELLY)
                    Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a
                    storm all night. Must know
                    somethin' I don't.
          She approaches Jeep.   Sees the strain in his eyes.

                              CHARLIE
                    Another bad dream?
          He struggles for a moment, nods.

                               CHARLIE
                    It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.
                    You do too much worryin'. About
                    this place. About your dad.

                        (BEAT)
                    About me...
          A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.

                              JEEP
                    You're the only thing I like
                    worrying about.

                              CHARLIE
                    See what I mean? You're worried
                    about a girl eight months pregnant
                    and it isn't even your baby. Now
                    that's enough to give anybody
                    nightmares.
          Jeep turns away, dejected.

                              JEEP
                    Go ahead, make fun of me.
                    Everybody else does.

                              CHARLIE
                        (turns him back around)
                    C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You
                    know how much I appreciate
                    everything you and Bob are doing
                    for me, but a month from now, this
                    baby'll have a new family and I'll
                    have to start thinkin' about what
                    the hell I'm doin' with my life.
          This is not news Jeep wants to hear.

          

                                                                      9.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    So you're still going through with
                    it...?

                              CHARLIE
                    Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama.
                    Christ, I can barely take care of
                    myself as it is.

                              JEEP
                    I could help you. We could do it
                    together, you know? I want to.
          Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but
          this just isn't where she's at.

                              CHARLIE
                    You gotta stop carryin' the weight
                    of the world on your shoulders.
          Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.

                              CHARLIE
                        (rubbing her arms)
                    Now can we go back in? I'm
                    freezing my ass off out here.

                               JEEP
                    Go on.   I'll be right there.
          Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the
          trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the
          clank of the door, she's gone.
          And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of
          FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.

                              JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)
                    I don't know whether I like it very
                    much being seen around with an
                    angel without any wings.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV
          Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his
          guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in
          and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to
          momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.

                              CLARENCE (ON TV)
                    Oh, I've got to earn them and
                    you'll help me, won't you?

          

                                                                  10.

          

          

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

          BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
          roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
          the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
          The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
          you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
          plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
          tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
          diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
          the Shopping Network.
          Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
          ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
          stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
          You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
          drinker.
          Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
          cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
          dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
          your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The
          dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
          hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.

                              PERCY
                    Lord as my witness, Bob, one of
                    these days that thing's gonna hit
                    you back.

          WHACK!

                              BOB
                    Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We
                    got a special relationship here.

          WHACK!

                              PERCY
                    Yeah, they got names for that kind
                    a relationship.
          The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
          MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".
          A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
          and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
          jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
          as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
          really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
          billboard of rebellion.

                              SANDRA (O.S.)
                    It's disgusting.

          

                                                                  11.

          

          

                              HOWARD (O.S.)
                    You're right. It is disgusting.
          Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
          diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA
          and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.

                              SANDRA
                    Really, how can she go out in
                    public wearing that?

                              HOWARD
                    I don't know. Why don't we just
                    ask her?

                              SANDRA
                    Howard, don't. You'll embarrass
                    me.

                              HOWARD
                        (shouting across the

                         DINER)
                    Audrey, honey? Your mother was
                    wondering if you got dressed this
                    morning with the specific intention
                    of showing your ass off to the
                    entire world?
          The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
          with a caustic smile.

                               AUDREY
                    Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping
                    to get double teamed by a couple of
                    meth head truckers in the bathroom
                    of some desert shithole.

                        (BEAT)
                    Good thing we stopped here.
          And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
          the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.
          Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile.

                              HOWARD
                    I feel satisfied with that answer.
                    I really do.
          Sandra buries her face in her hands.

                              SANDRA
                    I'm being punished for something, I
                    know it.

          

                                                                    12.

          

          
          Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the
          music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.

                                                              CUT TO:

          

          DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT
          The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through
          this barren country.
          A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder
          from within.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS
          (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad
          boy.
          He passes a weathered road sign:

          "ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"
          Kyle's expression says this is not good news.
          He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal.

                              KYLE
                    Shit...
          He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the
          lonely row of old gas pumps.
          Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
          the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
          Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
          rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
          SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
          The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
          parked in front of the garage with its hood up.
          Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and
          flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.
          Which way is north?

          

                                                                   13.

          

          

                               KYLE
                    Darren, your fuckin' directions
                    suck, man.
          He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way
          out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
          search of a pay phone.
          The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that
          it's been broken for ten years.
          Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
          a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
          very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
          is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name
          tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".

                              KYLE
                    Hey...
          She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.

                              KYLE
                    You know that shit right there
                    ain't good for the baby.
          She lets out a long slow exhale.

                              CHARLIE
                    Guess I should think `bout quittin'
                    then.

                              KYLE
                    Now hold on, girl, let me bum one
                    before you do.

                              CHARLIE
                    You can buy a whole pack inside.

                              KYLE
                    Tell ya what. You let me have one
                    of yours, and I'll give you two
                    from the new pack you're gonna sell
                    me.
          She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.
          Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle
          takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.

                              KYLE
                    Am I in the right place?

                              CHARLIE
                        (peers at the map)
                    Only if nowhere's right, `cause
                    that's where you are.

          

                                                                    14.

          

          

                              KYLE
                    Sonuvabitch. There another phone
                    around here? You know, one that
                    works?

                              CHARLIE
                    Bob'll probably let you use the
                    diner phone if you ask him real
                    nice...And pay `im somethin'.

                              KYLE
                    I can handle that.   You got
                    pancakes here?

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for
                    three seventy-five. We also got
                    french toast for four dollars if
                    you're into that. I personally
                    like the pancakes though.

                              JEEP (O.S.)
                    You okay, Charlie?
          They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing
          mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie
          quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
                    lost.
          Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
          shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette
          back up to her lips. An awkward beat.

                              KYLE
                    Three seventy-five, huh?

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY

          The DOOR JINGLES.   Charlie and Kyle enter.
          Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as
          well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex
          appeal she has in his direction.
          Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in
          Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban
          nightmare.
          Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
          smokes from underneath the counter.

          

                                                                 15.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    I hope Salem Lights are okay,
                    `cause that's all we got left.

                              KYLE
                    If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Where ya been, Charlie?
          Bob steps off the chair.

                              BOB
                    This ain't a resort you know.    I
                    got orders stacking up here.
          In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it
          certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.

                              BOB
                        (sees the two cigarettes
                         Kyle's handing her)
                    You best not be smokin' again.    Not
                    in your condition.

                              CHARLIE
                        (gestures to the diner)
                    Bob, do you see where am I right
                    now? Can my condition really get
                    any worse? `Sides, you ain't one
                    to talk.

                               BOB
                    What?   I quit two years ago.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, so why you still carryin'
                    that fancy lighter `round for?

                              BOB
                    It was a gift from my ex-wife,
                    alright? I'm sentimental. I don't
                    wanna forget how much I hate her
                    guts.

                               KYLE
                    Hey man?
          Bob turns to Kyle.   Doesn't like what he sees.

                              KYLE
                    Can I use your phone? My cell
                    doesn't get a signal out here and
                    the pay phone outside is busted.
          Bob is about to respond when:

          

                                                                  16.

          

          

                              HOWARD (O.S.)
                    Excuse me...?
          Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's
          interrupting.

                               HOWARD
                    Any news about when our truck might
                    be fixed? You said your boy would
                    have us on the road two hours ago.
                    The rate we're going, we'll be
                    lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
                    Christmas.
          Bob's expression darkens at this news.

                              BOB
                    Goddamn it. Where the hell is
                    Jeep?

                                                             CUT TO:

          

          A GRIMY PIECE OF WOOD
          A cloth wipes away the dirt, revealing the partial image of
          an ANGEL carved into the surface.

          

          INT. MECHANIC'S BAY - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a
          workbench. There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as
          if fear itself were driving him.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Hey, Leonardo...!
          Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to
          see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down
          Uhual.

                              BOB
                    The fact that this truck's hood's
                    up mean anything to you?
          Jeep stares at the ground.   Couldn't be anymore
          uncomfortable.

                              JEEP
                    Yeah...

                              BOB
                        (approaches, peering past
                         him to the crib)

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                 17.

          
                              BOB (cont'd)
                    Whaddya workin' on that's so
                    goddamn important you're not doin'
                    your job?

                                 JEEP
                    Nothin'...
          Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.
          Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.

                              JEEP
                    Found it under a bunch of stuff in
                    the storage shed. I know you never
                    like to throw anything away...
          Bob considers him, softens.

                              BOB
                    Whaddya doin'?

                                 JEEP
                    What...?

                              BOB
                    Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I
                    think it's real good of you to lend
                    her a helping hand, but she is not
                    your responsibility.

                              JEEP
                        (heard this before, pushes
                         past him)
                    Oh whatever, leave me alone.

                              BOB
                    Don't walk away from me while I'm
                    talkin' to you!

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right
          alongside him, not giving up.

                              BOB
                    How long you gonna follow her
                    around like a puppy dog? Cleanin'
                    up the messes she makes while she
                    steps out with every guy around
                    here other than you?!
          Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father:

                              JEEP
                    Don't say that about her!     She's
                    not like that!

          

                                                          18.

          

          
          Bob gives Jeep a hard stare.    Yeah, she is.

                              BOB
                    You really think she's gonna stick
                    around here after that baby's born
                    and off her hands?
          Jeeps shakes his head, burns.

                              JEEP
                    Look, I know it doesn't make any
                    sense to you, but it's just
                    something I have to do.
          Bob sighs, feels for his boy.

                               BOB
                        (points up at the PARADISE
                          FALLS sign)
                    See that up there? Your mother
                    thought I was crazy for wanting to
                    buy this place, middle of
                    nowhere...But I just knew this was
                    what I was supposed to do. Told
                    your mom, "just wait." Told her
                    when they finally ran the freeway
                    through here like they were
                    plannin' on, this place would be
                    like Grand Central Station.

                        (BEAT)
                    But I was wrong. The freeway never
                    came and now the only people who
                    ever stop here are the ones who are
                    lost.

                        (BEAT)
                    And your mom? Well she got tired
                    of waitin'.

                              JEEP
                    C'mon Dad. You can't blame
                    yourself for what she did--

                               BOB
                    Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're
                    about to make the same damn mistake
                    I made, believing in something
                    that's never gonna happen...Or
                    someone.

                        (BEAT)
                    It's time for you to move on from
                    this place, Jeep. I don't wanna
                    see you wake up one morning old and
                    pissed off, realizing you're lost
                    just like everybody else who stops
                    here.

          

                                                                     19.

          

          
          Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.    A
          tough pill to swallow.

                              BOB
                    Now get to work on that truck. I
                    wanna have these people on the road
                    by nightfall.
          Bob walks back into the diner.
          Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices
          something off in the distance.
          Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
          living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.
          Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the
          distant mountains. A storm is coming.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter,
          digging into a plate of banana pancakes.
          Kyle is about to address him again, when something else
          steals Bob's attention.

                               BOB
                        (holding up a silencing

                         HAND)
                    Yeah, wait a minute.
          The TV has gone on the fritz again.   Only now the image is
          mostly snow.
          Bob climbs back onto the chair.   Faces the TV.

                              BOB
                    What's wrong with you today?

          WHACK!
          The image flickers but doesn't improve.

                              PERCY
                    I told you to get the satellite TV.
                    But you don't wanna listen.

                              BOB
                    What the hell do I need that crap
                    for?

                              PERCY
                    History Channel, man!

          

                                                                    20.

          

          

                              BOB
                    I got all the history I can take.

                              CHARLIE
                    That's for sure.

                              BOB
                    What's your problem now?

          WHACK!

                              CHARLIE
                    Where do I start?

                              BOB
                    You know this was the top-of-the-
                    line model when I bought it.

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah, in the Fifties.

                              BOB
                    You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.
                        (rubs his hands together)
                    Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
          Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK!
          And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the picture
          he was expecting.
          The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
          its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner.
          Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.

                               BOB
                    See?   Clear as day.

                              PERCY
                    Nice work, Bob. What the hell's
                    that?

                              BOB
                    It's just one of those test things.
          That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the
          screen, which read:

          "THIS IS NOT A TEST"
          Bob switches the channels.    All the same.

                              CHARLIE
                    Don't look like a test.

          

                                                                      21.

          

          
          Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as
          if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into
          Kyle.

                               KYLE
                     Yo, am I the Invisible
                     motherfuckin' Man here?    Do you
                     have a phone or not?
          Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.
          That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his
          hand.

                               BOB
                     In the back past the kitchen.   Make
                     it fast.
          Kyle hustles passed Percy.
          Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.
          Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.

                               SANDRA
                     If there's a real emergency aren't
                     they supposed to give us some
                     information about what to do?

                               HOWARD
                     I'm sure it's a mistake.

                               BOB
                     Hey, Percy, give that old radio of
                     yours a shot. Maybe they got some
                     news about the TV.
          Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf.
          Switches it on.
          STATIC.   He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal.
          The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.   Station
          after station the same thing.
          The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
          TONES. Everyone goes very still.

                               KYLE (V.O.)
                     Let me talk to him...

          

          INT. DINER - BACK OFFICE - SAME

          Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back
          office, phone to his ear.

          

                                                                  22.

          

          

                               KYLE (CONT'D)
                        (on phone)
                    Cuz a father should be able to talk
                    to his son, that's why. Now put
                    `im on the phone.
                        (a beat then a smile)
                    Is that my little man...? Yeah,
                    well I'm working hard, so that I
                    can be with you. You bein' good?
                        (strange STATIC can be

                          HEARD)
                    Wait... You're breakin' up.
                    Hello...?
                        (hangs up in frustration)
                    Shit!
          Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.
          Frowns. No dial tone.

                              KYLE
                    What the hell...
          He keeps trying.    Nothing.

                              HOWARD (V.O.)
                    Maybe there was an earthquake?

          

          INT. DINER - SAME

          Everyone is looking at Howard.

                               HOWARD
                    They keep sayin' we're overdue for
                    a big one.

                              PERCY
                    Lot a folks could be hurt.

                              BOB
                    Not if it was centered in the
                    desert.

                                HOWARD
                    Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry
                    about.

                              SANDRA
                    So then why's the TV out?

                              HOWARD
                    Maybe it just hit the relay
                    stations. Aren't those usually in
                    remote areas?

          

                                                            23.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Yeah, `cause of the radiation they
                    give off.

                              PERCY
                    There ain't no radiation comin'
                    from those things. Plus that don't
                    explain the radio being out too.
                    Some of those stations broadcast
                    over hundreds of miles. Any quake
                    that big and we would a felt it.

                              CHARLIE
                    Percy's right. I didn't feel
                    nothing.

                              AUDREY
                    Maybe it's a terrorist attack or
                    something...?

                              SANDRA
                        (covers her mouth)
                    Oh god...
          Everyone considers that grimly, then:

                              BOB
                    Well, for cryin' out loud. There's
                    no use in speculating. I'll just
                    call my brother up in Needles. He
                    must a heard something.

                              KYLE (O.S.)
                    I don't think so.
          Kyle has reappeared in the diner.

                              BOB
                    Whaddya talkin' about?

                              KYLE
                    Phone's dead. Just tried to make a
                    call.

                              BOB
                    You're shittin' me.
          Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.

                              SANDRA
                    Oh, this is just great.

                              BOB
                    Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to
                    get excited about. Probably just
                    working on the lines.

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                   24.

          
                              BOB (cont'd)
                    Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your
                    truck fixed up quick as can be, and
                    then you'll be on your way.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something
          with a socket wrench. It's not going well.

                               JEEP
                    Damn it!
          He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.       The
          sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.
          He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
          the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery
          how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
          windshield.
          After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
          ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal
          frame and wheels of a walker.
          The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on
          the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
          with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches
          her disappear inside.
          He then looks toward the horizon again.   The WALL OF DARK
          CLOUDS are growing ever closer.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          A JINGLE as the old lady enters. She surveys the scene as if
          feasting on paradise. Maybe her eyes aren't so good.

                              CHARLIE
                    Have a seat wherever you want,
                    Ma'am. Specials are on the board.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Thank you, dear.
          The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons.
          She smiles at them pleasantly.
          Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Oh, I already know what I want.

                              CHARLIE
                    Okay, what'll it be?

          

                                                                    25.

          

          

                              OLD WOMAN
                    I'll have the steak, please.

                              CHARLIE
                    And how'd you like that cooked?

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Rare if you would. And water, no
                    ice.

                              CHARLIE
                    Coming right up.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Charlie, is it?

                              CHARLIE
                    Yeah.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    What an unusual name for a girl.

                              CHARLIE
                    So they say. I'll be right back
                    with your water.
          The old lady turns to the Andersons.

                              OLD WOMAN
                    Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.

                              SANDRA
                    Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm
                    Sandra and this is my husband
                    Howard.

                              GLADYS
                    What a nice young couple you are.
                    What brings you out to these parts?

                              SANDRA
                    We're moving out to Scottsdale.
                    But our truck broke down, and so
                    we're stuck here while it's being
                    fixed.

                              GLADYS
                    Oh, what a nuisance.
          A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head.    She doesn't seem
          to notice it.

                              SANDRA
                    Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are
                    down around here. The phone and
                    TV, you know?

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  26.

          
                              SANDRA (cont'd)
                    And I just was wondering if you
                    might have heard something on your
                    way up? You know, about what's
                    going on?
          Gladys smiles strangely.

                               GLADYS
                    Oh, don't worry yourself about
                    that, sweetheart. It'll all be
                    over soon.
          Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that
          response.
          The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S
          FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the
          least.
          Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy.
          The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a
          quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one
          eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the
          Andersons. Something about her...

                              JEEP
                    The carburetor's shot.    Don't know
                    why. Looks brand new.

                              BOB
                        (glances over at the

                         ANDERSONS)
                    Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.

                              JEEP
                    I could try to rebuild it, but it'd
                    take a while, and I don't think we
                    have all the parts. If we call
                    right now, we might be able to get
                    a new one down here tomorrow
                    morning.

                              BOB
                    That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn
                    phone's out.

                              JEEP
                    What?
          Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front
          of Gladys.

                              GLADYS
                    Thank you, dear. How far along are
                    you?

          

                                                                    27.

          

          
          Charlie rests a hand on her belly.

                              CHARLIE
                    Just about there.

                              GLADYS
                    The father must be very proud.

                              CHARLIE
                    I wouldn't know.

                              GLADYS
                    You mean he's...

                              CHARLIE
                    Out of sight. Out of mind.

                                 GLADYS
                    Oh, I see.     So you're not married,
                    I take it?
          A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
          away. But another one lands in its place.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Nope.
          Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
          ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More
          FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.
          Charlie is still trying to wave them away.

                              GLADYS
                    That's too bad.

                              CHARLIE
                    No, I prefer it that way. I don't
                    a need a man tellin' me what to do.

                              GLADYS
                    But what about the baby?

                              CHARLIE
                    I've got it under control.

                              GLADYS
                    Yeah, but it's gonna burn.
          Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle
          glances over from the counter.

                              CHARLIE
                    What did you just say?

          

                                                                    28.

          

          

                              GLADYS
                        (all smiles)
                    I said your fucking baby's gonna
                    burn.
          Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.

                              CHARLIE
                    Go to hell, lady.
          She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
          the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.

                              BOB
                    What happened?

                              CHARLIE
                    Total fucking Jesus freak.
          Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
          her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are
          swarming now. How did so many get in here?
          Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
          events.

                              GLADYS
                    All those babies.    They're gonna
                    burn.

                              SANDRA
                    Gladys, please. There's no reason
                    to --
          Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.

                              GLADYS
                    Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt!
                    All you do is complain! Complain!
                    Complain!
          Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is
          now focused on the old lady.
          Howard gets up from the booth.

                              SANDRA
                    Howard, it's okay!     Don't listen to
                    her!
          But Howard's already standing over Gladys.

                              HOWARD
                    Who the hell do you think you are,
                    lady?! Now, I'd like you to
                    apologize to my --

          

                                                                    29.

          

          

          GLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS

          NECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY

          RAZOR SHARP TEETH.
          EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.
          Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.   Blood
          covers her face and chest.

                              GLADYS
                    You're all going to fucking die!
          Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he
          whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head
          sideways. THWACK!
          BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is
          still standing.
          She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
          DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.
          Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.

                              BOB
                    Don't move!
          But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING

          WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!
          Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,
          as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --

          UPSIDE DOWN!
          BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't
          track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in
          the ceiling, a rain of plaster.
          Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.

                               BOB
                        (struggles to cock the

                          GUN)
                    Fuck!
          Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE

          ROOM!
          The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He
          snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face
          him.

                              PERCY
                    Shoot her, Jeep!
          Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.

          

                                                                       30.

          

          

                               GLADYS
                         (a sickly sweet smile)
                     You'll never save her.
          Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear
          paralyzing him where he stands.

                               PERCY

                     SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!
          Gladys rockets straight at him!
          But Jeep's too afraid to move.    He clamps his eyes shut,
          bracing himself for the end.

          BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!
          A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an
          animal.
          Jeep slowly opens his eyes.   His gun's still cocked.
          Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.
          He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
          silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so
          shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing
          such serious heat.

                               SANDRA (O.S.)
                     Somebody help me!
          Sandra is on the floor with her husband.     Blood pours freely
          from his neck.
          Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
          then he rushes to help.

                               KYLE
                     Press your hands over the hole!
          Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his
          hand.

                               KYLE
                     Don't look at me like that, lady!
                     I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you!
                     Now put your goddamn hands over the
                     hole before your husband bleeds to
                     death!
          Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,
          desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
          between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid
          kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.

          

                                                                    31.

          

          
          A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to
          his feet.

                               BOB
                    The fuck was that?!   What the fuck
                    was that!?
          Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her
          knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult
          facade giving way to that of a frightened child
          A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and
          see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An
          ungodly horror.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Kyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his
          neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

          Howard lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping
          his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun.
          Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition.
          The engine ROARS to life.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The Escalade fishtails onto the highway.

          

          INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

          Kyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed.

                              KYLE
                    How far to the hospital?

                              PERCY
                    Seventy, maybe eighty miles.
          Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor
          time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat.

                              AUDREY
                    What's that on the road?
          Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally
          closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL.

          

                                                                     32.

          

          

                               KYLE
                     They're fuckin' clouds!   What the
                     fuck do they look like?

                               AUDREY
                     Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz.
          She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING!

          PING!   PING!   PING!
          Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield --

          SPLAT!
          And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds.

          THEY'RE FLIES!
          The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by
          insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED
          bug guts. Driving blind!
          The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening!
          Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them...

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME

          Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of
          light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like
          he's about to puke or faint.

                                BOB
                     I don't understand how she was
                     still standin' after Percy hit `er
                     with that goddamn fryin' pan.
                     Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it.
                     I swear I did.

                         (BEAT)
                     And did you see that kid's gun?
                     The hell's he doin' with a gun like
                     that?
          Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling.

                               BOB
                     It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay.
          But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside.

                               JEEP
                     I couldn't pull the trigger. I
                     froze. I saw what I needed to do,
                     but I was afraid...
                         (breaks down)
                     She could've killed you!

                               (MORE)

          

                                                                   33.

          
                              JEEP (cont'd)
                    Or Charlie...She would've killed me
                    if it wasn't for...
          He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's
          shoulder.

                               BOB
                    There's nothin' to be ashamed of,
                    Jeep.

                        (BEAT)
                    Not everybody can play the hero.
          Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front

          DOOR JINGLE.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and
          Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling,
          gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help.
          Percy races for the back.

                              BOB
                        (catching Percy by the

                         ARM)
                    Where you going?!

                              PERCY
                    To get my bible!

                              BOB
                    The hell you need that for?!

                               PERCY
                    Well somebody's gotta start
                    prayin'...
          Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING.
          Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the

          SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK

          STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT.
          Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the
          day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm.
          Apocalyptic.
          No one breathes.

                                                              CUT TO:

          A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN
          Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to
          the bone.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding
          her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey
          watches from a distance with grim fascination.

                              PERCY
                        (raises a bottle of

                         ALCOHOL)
                    Okay, hold `em steady.

                              CHARLIE
                        (nods, peakish, to

                         HERSELF)
                    Oh god, please don't throw up.
          Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.
          Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.
          Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the
          tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle
          stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --
          just in case.
          Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
          from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
          Percy's frying pan.

                              BOB
                    She's cold as a freakin' ice cube.
                    If I hadn't just seen her walk in
                    here, I'd say the old bag's been
                    dead for hours.
          Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
          mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.

                              KYLE
                    Well, I don't care how long she's
                    been dead, the bitch ain't stayin'
                    in here with us.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the
          plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily
          eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.

          

                                                                       35.

          

          

                              BOB
                    I don't get it.    Why don't they
                    come closer?

                              KYLE
                    How the fuck am I supposed to know,
                    man? You askin' me to explain the
                    behavior of a motherfuckin'
                    pestilence.
          A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped
          to the ground.

                              JEEP
                        (holding up the keys)
                    You guys!

          

          GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME
          Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE
          AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer
          inside the car.

                              BOB
                    You see anything?

                              KYLE
                    No Twilight Zone shit if that's
                    what you mean.
          Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it.

                              BOB
                    Careful. Old lady could have some
                    kind of rabid poodle locked up in
                    there.
          Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell
          hits them.

                               KYLE
                    Agh!   What the fuck is that?
          Bob covers his nose.

                                 BOB
                    Jesus.
          Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But
          nothing unusual.

                              KYLE
                    Nothin' here.

          

                                                                    36.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    How `bout the trunk?
          They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key
          in.
          The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING.

          MAGGOT INFESTED.
          Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeling
          with disgust.
          Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.

                              KYLE
                    Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats
                    in her hoopty! What the fuck is
                    wrong with white people?!

                              BOB
                    Least now we know where that smell
                    was coming from.

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin'
                    necessity we figured that out, man.

                               JEEP
                        (sees something up the

                         ROAD)
                    Hey...
          They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.
          A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
          stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
          clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug
          splattered windows.

                              BOB
                    Okay, now we're talkin'.

                              JEEP
                    Wait a minute. Check it out. It's
                    LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way
                    out here?
          Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.

                              KYLE
                    I'm from Nevada, man.
          They consider the police car a moment more. See the
          SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.

          

                                                                    37.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Give me the shotgun.
          Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.

          Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.

                              CHARLIE
                    Oh, thank God, the police!

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
          diner.
          The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face
          goes slack.

                              JEEP
                    Charlie, wait!
          The men begin to run toward her...
          While out of the police car steps...

          MICHAEL
          Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
          piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,
          as if she was exactly who he expected to see.
          In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
          front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.

                              BOB
                    Take one step closer and I'll drop
                    you right here.
          A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold.

                               MICHAEL
                    That how you greet all your
                    customers?

                              BOB
                    Mister, after what we've been
                    through here today, you're lucky we
                    didn't shoot you first and greet
                    you later. Now let me see your
                    teeth.
          Michael stares at him blankly.

          

                                                                       38.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see
                    `em!
          Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
          kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others
          ease slightly.

                              JEEP
                    No, shark teeth, Pop.
          Bob lowers the gun.

                               BOB
                    Okay... Suppose you tell us your
                    name then.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Michael.

                              BOB
                    Sorry about all that, Michael.
                    This old lady just went crazy
                    inside my place here. She had
                    these teeth. Never seen anything
                    like `em. Practically bit a man in
                    half.
          Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
          by what he's heard.

                              BOB
                    So what are you doin' out here?
                    Gotta say you don't exactly look
                    like a police officer. Even one
                    from L.A. Then again, you have to
                    be, right? I mean, who the hell'd
                    be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
          Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in
          kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the
          shotgun again.
          Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
          the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic
          table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:

                              MICHAEL
                    You don't know, do you?

                                 KYLE
                    Know what?

          

                                                                     39.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    We don't know anything. Nothing's
                    working here. The TV, the radio,
                    the phone...
          Michael just shakes his head.

                              MICHAEL
                    I'm running out of time.
          Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
          blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.

                               BOB
                    Back off, fella...

                        (BEAT)
                    Now, I don't care if this is the
                    second coming of Jesus fucking
                    Christ, I say it's time for you to
                    either get talkin' or get the hell
                    outta here!
          In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's
          hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find
          himself holding air.
          He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
          pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.

                               KYLE
                    Easy!   Easy!
          Michael's expression is totally calm.   Merciless.

                              JEEP
                    C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry.
                    Tell `em you were only kidding!
          But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes his
          eyes closed.

                              CHARLIE
                    Let `em go!
          Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.
          Considering her.
          The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand
          and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra
          and Audrey.
          Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.

          

                                                                   40.

          

          

                               PERCY
                    Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna
                    go spillin' blood for no good
                    reason in front of all these decent
                    people, do ya? Our friend Bob here
                    ain't worth the trouble it'd cause
                    ya.

                        (BEAT)
                    So whaddya say `bout just lettin'
                    `im go and then you can be on your
                    way? Nice `n' easy.
          But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea.   It's not
          looking good.
          No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
          the direction of the road.

          DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE.

          APPROACHING.

                              KYLE
                    What the--?
          Michael turns, sees the lights.

                              MICHAEL
                    They're here.
          Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it
          back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,
          speechless.

                              MICHAEL
                    You're going to need this.
          Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser.
          Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.

          HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN.
          Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.

                              PERCY
                    Lord, have mercy.
                        (waving back Audrey and

                         SANDRA)
                    You ladies best get back inside.

                              SANDRA
                    What is it? What's happening? Who
                    is this man? Why's he driving a
                    police car?

                              AUDREY
                    Shut up, mom!

          

                                                                    41.

          

          
          Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.
          Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one
          goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's
          hands, who stares down at it anxiously.

                               BOB
                    Wait. I don't think that's such a
                    good idea.

                              JEEP
                    Dad, I can handle it.

                              BOB
                        (to Michael)
                    He's just a kid --

                              JEEP
                    I said, I can handle it!
          Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.

                              MICHAEL
                    He can handle it. He doesn't have
                    a choice.
          Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
          everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the
          men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.

                              MICHAEL
                    If you want to live, you'll do
                    exactly as I say.
          He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a
          Glock and hands it to her.

                               MICHAEL
                    When you fire, you keep your thumb
                    off the slide. Don't hesitate.
                    Don't do anything brave. There's
                    no safety.
          He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him
          but not sure why.
          Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the
          others, then he bolts after Michael.
          Percy follows.   Then Charlie.
          Now it's only Jeep and his father left.

                              BOB
                    C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!

          

                                                                          42.

          

          
          And Bob rushes into the diner.
          A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.

          THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER.
          He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.

                                  JEEP
                     Fuck it.
          And races after his father.

                                                                     CUT TO:

          A DEAD BOLT
          Thrown.   Locking the diner door.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of
          the door, sealing off the entrance.
          Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.
          Window blinds are snap closed.

          

          THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          Jeep races in, locks the back door.       Then he pushes a desk in
          front of it.

          

          IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS
          The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF
          ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.
          Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.
          She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to
          keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.

                                 HOWARD
                     Sandra?    What's happening?

                                  SANDRA
                     It's okay!     Everything's okay!
          Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it.
          Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into

          DARKNESS.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          
          We hear CRIES OF ALARM.   TOTAL BLACK.   Chaos.

                              BOB (V.O.)
                    Jeep, get the flashlights!

                              PERCY (V.O.)
                    Everybody just stay still!

                              KYLE (V.O.)
                    Now that we're locked in here, what
                    the fuck are we supposed to do?
          A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH
          THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.
          Michael looks up at the ceiling.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - NIGHT

          A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy
          and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the
          "Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.
          The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE
          WIND coming up off the desert.

                              KYLE
                    Where the hell did they go?
          Bob turns to Michael sharply.

                              BOB
                    Alright, Rambo. You got us up
                    here. Now you mind explaining what
                    the fuck we're fighting?
          Michael is about to answer, when:

                              PERCY
                    Listen!
          Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
          The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.

                              PERCY
                    You hear what I'm hearing?

                              BOB
                    Yeah...The hell is that?
          The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
          Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.
          But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with
          dread.

          

                                                                   44.

          

          

                              PERCY
                    It sounds almost like...

                                 KYLE
                    Ice cream.
          TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the   darkness. And sure enough, an
          ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly   toward the diner. The EERIE
          CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from   a speaker on its roof. It's too
          dark to see who's behind the   wheel.

                              KYLE
                    You've got to be fuckin' kidding
                    me.

                              MICHAEL
                    Alright. There's a safety switch
                    on the side of your gun. Push it
                    all the way down. Two clicks.
          The men quickly do as they're told.

                              MICHAEL
                    Now when this starts, you hold on
                    tight, you hear me? If you don't,
                    you're going to blow your hand off.
                    Understand?
          Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.

                              PERCY
                    The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the
          MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could
          stop shaking, it might be believable.
          Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
          windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the
          diner.
          Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
          Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a
          hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.
          Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.

                               HOWARD
                    Oh, honey, listen.    It's the Ice
                    Cream Man.

          

                                                                      45.

          

          

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
          facing the diner.
          Everyone aims their guns at the truck.     Tense.
          From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
          ground.
          MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to
          reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say
          hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.
          He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he
          steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
          more clearly.
          He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.
          And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like
          taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him
          for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,
          the roof -- assessing the situation.
          On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.

                              KYLE

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Ah, he don't look that bad.
          The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof.      He heard.

                                 KYLE
                    Oh, shit.     Oh, shit.   Oh, shit.
          That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING

          TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW
          AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
          sound of CRACKING OF BONES.
          From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
          shattering HOWL.
          Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
          fear.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Get ready!
          And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
          SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal
          man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.
          Michael aims.

          

                                                                       46.

          

          

          BLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM!
          Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on
          his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching
          mess.
          Michael keeps his aim.    Waits.   The CALLIOPE music continues
          to play.

                               KYLE
                     Is that it?
          Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A
          freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the
          wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE

          COMMUTERS.

                                MICHAEL
                     Now!   Shoot now!
          The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.

          WINDSHIELDS SHATTER!    TIRES BLOW OUT!   ENGINES EXPLODE!
          Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!
          DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.
          In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS

          PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL
          FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many
          mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.

                               MICHAEL
                     Spread out! Don't let them get
                     close to the windows!
          The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.
          They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't
          actually touch the ground.
          From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow
          Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.
          Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.
          SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from
          a sprinkler.
          BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't
          seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in
          their sheer numbers.
          With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
          diner.

          

                                                                        47.

          

          
          ON BOB firing madly.    Then...   CLICK!   CLICK!   Oh, no.   He's
          out of ammo.

                                 BOB
                    Shells!
          Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
          and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.

                                 BOB
                    Fuck!
          With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
          for the ammo. Stretching... Further...

          A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM
          BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers
          before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in
          tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she
          clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.
          Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts
          to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!
          Percy sees his friend in trouble.

                                 PERCY
                    Bob!
          Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the
          bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide
          even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he
          can't stop!

          BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP

          RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!
          She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
          akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!
          The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
          force halts Bob's slide.

                              PERCY
                        (extending his hook)
                    Grab my hand!
          Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays
          on.
          But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
          Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!

                                 BOB
                    Gun!

          

                                                                     48.

          

          
          Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly
          catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman
          pounces on him.

                              BOB
                        (jamming the gun in her

                         MOUTH)
                    Fuck off!
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body
          goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.

                              BOB
                    Pull me up!
          Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just
          outside.
          Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.   A few feet away,
          Audrey clutches a butcher's knife.
          Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.   Trying to
          keep it together.
          Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the
          handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS
          rattle the plates on the shelves.
          Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the
          front windows.
          Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
          Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad.

                              PERCY
                    Come on, motherfuckers!   Come on!
          Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated
          by the fire from the rooftop.

          

                                                                     49.

          

          

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          ON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go
          wide as --
          SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass,
          sand and dust swirl in.
          Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.
          Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
          Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically
          for the intruder. It's so dark!

                              JEEP
                    Where is it?!
          Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
          looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's
          too much.

                               AUDREY
                    Mom!   Open your eyes!

                               SANDRA
                    I can't!   I can't!
          Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
          got hold of his legs!   That gets Sandra's eyes open!

                              SANDRA
                        (springing after her

                         HUSBAND)
                    Howard!
          Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
          the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,
          desperately trying to grab a hold of something.
          Sandra scrambles after her husband.   Reaching for him.

                               AUDREY
                    Daddy!
          The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's
          outstretched hands. She has him!
          The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered
          window.   It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light
          falling across its face, reveals:
          A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.   Her skin is a deathly
          blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.

          

                                                                   50.

          
          Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated
          flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds
          of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.

                              TEENAGE GIRL
                    See what you made me do, mother!?
          Sandra screams, holds on.

                              SANDRA
                    No!
          Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's
          arms.
          Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
          with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he
          discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.
          Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.   A human
          tug-of-war.

          ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE

          CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS.
          Howard's body lurches further out the window.

                              SANDRA
                    Howard!
          Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie
          daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain
          leverage.

          ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS

          ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!
          Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,
          losing her grip on Howard's belt.
          Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
          LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to
          his baby girl.

                              RAGGEDY MAN

                        (SWEETLY)
                    There you are!
          And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures
          suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she
          alone was their target.
          Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,
          grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.

          

                                                                      51.

          

          
          Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
          Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the
          window.

                                 AUDREY
                    Daddy!

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The tide is turning. The men seem to have gotten their game
          on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.

                              KYLE
                    They're running!      We got `em!
          Kyle turns happily to Michael.     Gone.   Kyle looks around the
          roof with alarm.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death
          through the window. Jeep's losing her!

          A FLASH OF STEEL.    SCHING!
          Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like
          hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to
          their owners.
          Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a
          machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his
          path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures
          SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken
          their first victim.
          Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
          Jeep scoot away from the window.
          Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
          after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.

                                 SANDRA
                    Let me go!     He's alive!
          Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
          the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.

                              SANDRA
                    He's alive!

                                 MICHAEL
                    No...     Not anymore.
          Sandra breaks down.

          

                                                                         52.

          

          
          As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain.       She
          clutches her belly. Winces.
          Jeep catches her arm to steady her.

                              CHARLIE

                        (RECOVERING)
                    I'm okay. I'm fine.
          She glances back at Michael.       He's watching her.   Those eyes.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Thanks...

                              MICHAEL
                    I told you not to do anything
                    brave.
          Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say
          something when --
          Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face.

                              KYLE
                    We got `em runnin'!
          Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his
          excitement falling.

                              KYLE
                    Where's Howard?
          No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together.
          Crying.
          Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
          adrenaline.

                              MICHAEL
                    Someone needs to be on the roof.

                                 KYLE
                    I'll go.
          Bob grabs Kyle's arm.

                              BOB
                    Hold on.
                        (approaches Michael,

                         DETERMINED)
                    You better start talking.
          All eyes on Michael.    These people want answers.      Finally:

          

                                                          53.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    The first time God lost faith in
                    Man he sent a flood. The second
                    time...he sent what you see
                    outside.
          Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:

                              PERCY
                    You sayin' this is the
                    Apocalypse...?

                               MICHAEL
                    I'm saying this is an
                    extermination.

                        (BEAT)
                    Those things out there are vessels.
                    The Possessed. The weakest willed
                    are the easiest to turn.

                              KYLE
                    Possessed by what?    Demons?

                              MICHAEL
                    No...by angels.
          That silences the room.

                              PERCY
                        (pulls out his bible)
                    Son, I don't know what bible you
                    been readin', but in my version,
                    the angels are the good guys.
          Michael looks squarely at Percy.

                              MICHAEL
                    That's where your book is wrong.

                              SANDRA
                    How come you know so much about
                    them?

                              MICHAEL
                    I know because until last night, I
                    was on their side.

                              JEEP
                    You mean you're...
          Michael considers Jeep, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    Not anymore...

          

                                                                     54.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Right and yesterday I was the
                    fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know,
                    fuck this. I don't even believe in
                    God.

                              MICHAEL
                    That's fine, because He doesn't
                    believe in you either.
          Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.

                              PERCY
                    C'mon, Bob. Have you looked
                    outside recently? Those aren't
                    exactly our regular customers out
                    there.

                              BOB
                    How do we know he didn't bring them
                    here himself?

                              CHARLIE
                    He brings them here and then he
                    saves us from them? You're a
                    genius, Bob.
          Bob falls silent, confounded.
          Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.

                              AUDREY
                    So you're here to protect us?

                               MICHAEL
                    Not you...
                         (looks at Charlie)
                    Her.
          Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.

                               CHARLIE
                    Me?!   Why me?!

                              MICHAEL
                    Because your child is the only hope
                    humanity has of surviving.
          In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can
          do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.

                               CHARLIE
                    No way!
          But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes
          genuine fear.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          

                              CHARLIE

                        (STUNNED)
                    Jesus Christ...

                               MICHAEL
                    Exactly.
          Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is
          starting to make sense.

                              JEEP
                    You're sayin' she's the mother of
                    the Messiah?

                              BOB
                    Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed
                    to be a vi--

                              CHARLIE
                    Go fuck yourself, Bob!

                              PERCY
                    Makes you wonder about Mary.

                              CHARLIE
                        (approaches Michael, panic
                         setting in)
                    Look, this is not possible! I'm
                    just a waitress! I'm nobody! I
                    can't give birth to the Savior of
                    Mankind!
                        (and finally)
                    I don't even own a car!

                              MICHAEL
                    None of that matters anymore.
                    Either your child lives or Mankind
                    dies.

                              KYLE
                    So what, we're supposed to just
                    hold those things off until Mary
                    over there squeezes one out?

                              MICHAEL
                    That's right.

                              CHARLIE
                    That can't be. I'm only eight
                    months pregnant.

                              KYLE
                    Oh we're fucked.     We are so fucked!

          

                                                                      56.

          

          

                              SANDRA
                    How are we supposed to survive here
                    for a month?

                              MICHAEL
                    We won't have to...
          At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.

                              CHARLIE
                    It's coming soon, isn't it?
          Michael nods.
          Charlie sways on her feet.   Jeep rests a hand on her
          shoulder, steadying her.
          With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group
          with finality.

                               MICHAEL
                    If you want to live you'll do what
                    I say. This first attack was a
                    test of our strength. The next one
                    will be a test of our weakness.

                        (BEAT)
                    Something much worse is on its way.
          Everyone exchanges terrified looks.   Finally, Kyle steps
          forward.

                              KYLE
                    Okay, what's your plan?

                              MICHAEL
                    We'll keep watch on the roof in
                    shifts of two. Jeep, go get some
                    tools. We need to close up this
                    window before somebody else goes
                    out.
          Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he
          follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the
          SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT

          Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're
          wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from
          the cold and the flies.
          Percy scans the horizon.   Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the
          darkness.

          

                                                                   57.

          

          

                               PERCY
                    They're out there. Sons of
                    bitches. I can feel `em.

                        (BEAT)
                    Damn it's cold!
          Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"
          together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog
          tags.

                              KYLE
                    You were in the Army?

                              PERCY
                    Navy, two tours. But the second
                    one didn't work out so well, so I
                    didn't get to go back for a third.
                    Suppose that makes me lucky in a
                    way. Served with Bob, you know.
                    That's how I ended up in this
                    place.

                              KYLE
                    What was it like?    Being in a war?

                               PERCY
                    Dark.   Like this.
          Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches
          it from hand to hand.

                              PERCY
                    So what's with that gun?

                               KYLE
                    What?

                              PERCY
                    Your piece. The one you killed
                    grandma with. Don't reckon it's
                    for huntin' buck.

                              KYLE
                    No. I uh -- keep it for
                    protection.

                              PERCY
                    Protection from what?

                              KYLE
                    From people.
          Percy looks at him skeptically.

                               PERCY
                    People.

          

                                                                     58.

          

          

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, people who might try to give
                    me a hard time, you know?

                              PERCY
                    Just regular people or uh...

                              KYLE
                    Yeah, well, no, not regular,
                    regular people.

                              PERCY
                    Irregular people then.

                               KYLE
                    I'm talkin' people whose job it is
                    to give other people a hard time.
                    Kinda person who doesn't get enough
                    fiber in their diet, you know what
                    I'm sayin?

                              PERCY
                    So it's a work thing, is it?

                                KYLE
                    Exactly.    Strictly business.

                              PERCY
                    This business of yours... You like
                    it?
          Kyle's eyes narrow.

                              KYLE
                    Who the fuck are you to be sweatin'
                    me, man? I got my reasons for
                    doin' what I do.
          Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally:

                              PERCY
                    When I was a kid my father would
                    sit by my bed every night before
                    I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me,
                    Percy, if you don't wake up
                    tomorrow, if it turns out that
                    today was your last day on earth,
                    would you be proud of what you've
                    done in this life? Cuz if you
                    ain't, then you better start
                    gettin' square.
          Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to
          the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.

                                                                CUT TO:

          

                                                                     59.

          

          

          

          THE SILVER ZIPPO
          rolls between dirty fingers.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - NIGHT

          Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up
          some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every
          few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it
          down fast enough.
          Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a
          prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread
          around.
          Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
          another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and
          places it in front of her.

                              BOB
                    On the house.
          She looks up at him.    Smiles weakly.   Takes a sip.

                                 SANDRA
                    Thanks.

                              BOB
                    You hungry?

                              SANDRA
                    Couldn't eat if my life depended on
                    it.

                              BOB
                    Well I figure just cuz the world's
                    coming to an end, it doesn't mean a
                    man's gotta starve. All I can say
                    is thank heavens they left the gas
                    on.
          Sandra takes another sip of beer.   Considers it.

                              SANDRA
                    Never much cared for beer.
                    Howard's the beer drinker in the
                    family.
          The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her
          again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses
          them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This
          is a battle she's losing.

          

                                                                  60.

          

          
          Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling
          with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial.
          Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC.
          Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael
          nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He
          eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two
          jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.

                              JEEP
                    What did you do...you know, before
                    you came here...?
          Michael considers the question a beat, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    I was a soldier, a general, in His
                    army.

                              JEEP
                    Well, what changed?   What made you
                    leave?

                              MICHAEL
                    I was given an order I didn't
                    believe in...
                        (off Jeep's look:)
                    He lost faith. I hadn't.
          Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.

                              JEEP
                    So what happens to you...after this
                    is over?
          Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:

                              MICHAEL
                    Sometimes we have to face the thing
                    we fear the most in order to be
                    free of it.
          Michael picks up his gun.

                              MICHAEL
                    It's almost time for the next
                    shift.
          Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,
          deep in thought.

                                                            CUT TO:

          The faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty
          haze. A new day has forced itself into existence.
          TITLE:   "December 24th - 6:05am"

          

          EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - MORNING

          Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for
          movement. His expression focused, determined.
          On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to
          stay awake. The beer taking over. His eyes droop closed.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Sandra awakens with a start.

                                 SANDRA
                     Howard?
          But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is
          still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her
          fear is returning.

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Sandra splashes water on her face.   Stares at herself in the
          mirror. A living wreck.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Sandra steps out of the bathroom.

                               VOICE
                         (a whisper)
                     Sandra...
          Sandra freezes.

                               SANDRA
                     Who's there?
          A beat then:

                                 VOICE
                     Sandra...
          Sandra spins around.    Searching.

          

                                                                      62.

          

          

                                 SANDRA
                    Howard?     Is that you?
          It sure sounded like Howard.

                                 VOICE
                    Help me...     Please...
          This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra
          turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it.
          Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.

                              VOICE
                        (from behind the door)
                    Help me. Sandra...
          Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do?
          That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door.
          She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see
          out.

          SANDRA'S POV:
          Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.     NAILED

          TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.
          But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible
          black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are
          breathing.
          Sandra goes slack with horror.

                              HOWARD
                    Help me, please!
          Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
          covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.

                                 SANDRA
                    Howard!
          Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
          away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when
          Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.

                                 AUDREY
                    Mom!
          Kyle races to restrain Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                    Let me go!     He's alive!

          

                                                                     63.

          

          
          She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags
          Kyle in the face. Down he goes.
          Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the
          sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be
          heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue.
          Sleep.

          RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...
          Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME

          Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey
          hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy
          appears in the doorway.
          Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and
          that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.
          Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive.
          Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy.

                                SANDRA
                    Howard!
          And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --
          -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying
          streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --
          -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her
          from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not
          stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door
          SLAMMING closed behind them.
          Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into
          the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.
          But she's not fighting anymore.
          Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
          back to the door, breathing heavily.

          

                                                                        64.

          

          

                                 CHARLIE
                       Percy?
          He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.
          The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away.

                                                                CUT TO:

          

          A SHEET
          covering a body.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - FREEZER ROOM - DAY

          Percy's body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully
          at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his
          face. He rolls the Zippo between his fingers.
          Jeep watches his father from the doorway.

                                 JEEP
                       We should get back out there...

                                 BOB
                       Just gimme another minute with him,
                       okay?
          Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead
          friend.

                                                                CUT TO:

          

          SANDRA'S FACE
          Catatonic.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it
          looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never
          know.
          Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
          never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
          her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father
          making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.
          In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains
          her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.
          Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.

          

                                                                       65.

          

          
          She brings her ear up close.      Wait.   Is that a VOICE?
          She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into
          focus. CLEARER.

                                 AUDREY
                     Hey...
          CLEARER.   Yes.   It's a VOICE!

                               AUDREY
                     Hey! You guys, I think I got
                     something here!
          Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around
          the radio.

          THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE.      STRAINED

          BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.

                                RADIO VOICE
                     ... battling has been fierce. The
                     numbers of casualties are unknown
                     but all indications are that they

                     If you're just joining us, we're
                     getting some of the first bits of
                     good news, if you can call it that,
                     since this apocalypse began just
                     twenty-four ago. A human militia
                     has formed on the outskirts of Las
                     Vegas and has begun to engage the
                     enemy. Also down in the Four
                     Corners area, we've been receiving
                     unconfirmed reports of another
                     resistance force gathering in Red
                     Rock National in the northern
                     Mojave Desert area.

                     That can't be more than an hour up
                     the highway from here.

                               AUDREY
                     Does that mean we can leave?

                                 MICHAEL
                     No.    We're not going anywhere.

                               BOB
                     What the hell are you talkin'
                     about? This is our chance!

          

                                                                   66.

          

          

                                  MICHAEL
                       We can't risk being on the move
                       when the child comes. It's too
                       dangerous.
          Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,
          anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and
          races for the bathroom.

                                 RADIO VOICE
                       ... And as we fight this new
                       enemy, may God give us the strength
                       to survive and show mercy for those
                       of us who are already lost...

                                                             CUT TO:

          

          A CIGARETTE
          being lit.

          

          INT. DINER BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water
          running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag,
          feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant.
          Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her
          hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her
          eyes, fear and anger overtaking her.
          She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.

          

          INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER

          It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie,
          wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.

                                 JEEP (O.S.)
                       Guess it's your turn not to sleep.
          Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.

                                   CHARLIE
                       Hey...
          Jeep sees the strain on her face.

                                   JEEP
                       You okay?

          

                                                                     67.

          

          

                              CHARLIE
                    You mean besides the fact that I
                    just found out that I'm the mother
                    of the Messiah?
          Jeep smiles, nods.

                               CHARLIE
                    Crazy thing is...I didn't want this
                    baby. I even went down to the
                    clinic, you know that?
                        (off Jeep's reaction:)
                    I remember sitting there in the
                    waiting room, absolutely sure I was
                    doin' the right thing...And that's
                    when the feeling started. Like I
                    was falling into the deepest,
                    darkest hole imaginable. I
                    couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.
                    I kept thinking this must be what
                    death is like. And when finally
                    they called my name, I ran.

                        (BEAT)
                    For a while after that I tried
                    pretending that it was just cold
                    feet, that I could go back if I
                    wanted to, that I could decide to
                    end it like I'd planned. Then I'd
                    start to have that feeling again
                    and I knew I didn't have a choice.
                    Somehow this had already been
                    decided. And it made me hate this
                    thing that's been growing inside
                    me.
          A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:

                              JEEP
                    You shouldn't say things like that,
                    Charlie. It isn't right. You'll
                    get through this. I know you will.
          She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:

                              CHARLIE
                    How come you have so much faith in
                    me, Jeep? God knows I've never
                    given you or anybody else a reason
                    to. Or is it that you just can't
                    find any other hard-luck case to
                    follow around?
          Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated.

          

                                                                     68.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    You know, you're not the only who's
                    suffered, okay? Let me know when
                    you stop feeling sorry for
                    yourself.
          And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare
          after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON

          Sand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking.
          Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping
          watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5.

                              KYLE
                    ...Then you just flip this --
          Audrey flips the safety.

                              AUDREY
                    Yeah, I got it. All the way down.
                    Two clicks.
          She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding
          one all her life.
          Off Kyle's surprised look:

                              AUDREY
                    Dated this guy last summer. A
                    marine. Had a thing for guns.
                    Parents hated him.

                              KYLE
                    I bet they did.
          After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands
          the gun over to Kyle.
          Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her
          expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years
          overnight.

                              AUDREY
                    My parents hate everything I do.
                    That's why we were moving.

                                KYLE
                    Yeah?

          

                                                                         69.

          

          

                              AUDREY
                    They thought a more "wholesome"
                    environment would help me "change
                    my ways." So fucked up. Only
                    reason they care at all is cuz they
                    don't want to be embarrassed in
                    front of their friends at the
                    country club.
          Kyle considers her thoughtfully.

                              KYLE
                    The only time my old man ever paid
                    attention to me was when I was
                    doing somethin' bad. So you know
                    what I did?

                               AUDREY
                    What?

                              KYLE
                    I got really good at being bad.
          She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He
          wipes a tear from her cheek.
          She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately.
          His hands trace over her body.
          She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.
          She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.
          It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.
          She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head
          back. Further.
          Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
          to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant
          red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.
          Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's
          FLUORESCENTS flicker on.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.
          The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's
          "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".
          Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.
          The electric fan spins on above the grill.

          

                                                                    70.

          

          
          Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the
          window.
          Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.
          Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light.

                              BOB
                    We back in business?

                              MICHAEL
                    I don't think so.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you
          didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business
          as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the
          dramatic change.

                              AUDREY
                    Is it over?

                              KYLE
                    I don't know.
          HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.

                              KYLE
                        (raising his gun)
                    You better get downstairs.

                              AUDREY
                    No, I can handle it.
          Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he
          pulls out his silver 45.

                              KYLE
                        (handing her the gun)
                    Just in case.
          The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
          the highway to stop at the pumps.

                                 KYLE
                    Get ready.
          They aim their weapons at the vehicle.
          A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.
          He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the
          coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
          YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.

          

                                                                     71.

          

          
          He races around to the gas pump.

                              KYLE
                        (lowering his gun)
                    Wait a minute.

                              AUDREY
                    Kyle, are they...
          A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look
          out over the back side of the diner.
          AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
          Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the
          pump. Flips the lever.

                              KYLE
                    It's a trap. They saw them coming
                    and turned on the lights. It's a
                    fucking trap!
          Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.

                             KYLE AND AUDREY
                    Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a
                    trap!
          But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
          WIND as he pumps the gas.
          Kyle fires his gun in the air.   BLAM!   BLAM!     BLAM!
          At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the
          roof.   His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO
          HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but
          he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.
          Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.

                              AUDREY
                    They're not gonna make it.
          The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the
          door.
          But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time
          to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.
          His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.
          Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
          surround the vehicle like swarming insects.
          The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
          the vehicle by skeletal hands.

          

                                                                      72.

          

          

                              AUDREY
                        (pushing his barrel down)
                    Wait! You'll hit them too!
          So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
          the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the
          ground in front of the diner.

                              AUDREY
                    Kyle!
          Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the
          woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.
          He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
          that comes at him.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward
          the pumps.

                               BOB
                    Jesus Christ, what the hell is that
                    boy doin'!

                              CHARLIE
                    We have to get `im back in here!
          Bob springs into action.   Pushes the booth away from the
          front door.
          The sound of a gun COCKING.
          Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.

                              MICHAEL
                    Don't. You open that door and we
                    could all be dead.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably
          agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.
          He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures
          huddled around them.
          He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
          covering his face.
          Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.

          

                                                                     73.

          

          

                                 KYLE
                    I got you!
          Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.
          The creatures have stopped coming at him.
          In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting.
          Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
          wrong.

                                 YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
                    Mister...
          Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES
          stare back at him.

                               YOUNG BOY

                        (WHISPERS)
                    Fooled ya.

          A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT.
          Kyle drops to his knees.
          Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.

                                 AUDREY
                    Kyle!

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Bob kicks over a table in disgust.

                              BOB
                    Damn it all to hell!

                               CHARLIE
                    Oh, no.   Audrey...
          Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and
          run towards Kyle.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life
          drain from his body.
          The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears
          suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to
          her.

          

                                                                      74.

          

          

                                 YOUNG BOY
                    I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to!

                                 AUDREY
                    Fuck you!
          Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK.
          She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing.
          The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an
          eerie calm for someone so young.

                              YOUNG BOY
                    You're gonna die now.
          The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body.
          Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the
          diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.
          They're everywhere.    She's trapped.
          She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS.
          Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly
          closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!
          She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press
          against the windows. A nightmare come to life.

          Panic.
          Charlie rushes to Michael's side.

                              CHARLIE
                    Do you have no heart?!     She's just
                    a kid!
          But he's immovable.

                              CHARLIE
                    You can't let her die!
                        (grabbing a gun from the

                         TABLE)
                    I swear if you don't do something,
                    I will!
          Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Wait.

          

                                                                    75.

          

          
          Charlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then:

                              MICHAEL
                        (raising his guns)
                    Open the door.
          Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the
          dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed
          Charlie and out into hell.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps.
          IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK.
          She's running out of time.
          Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at
          the minivan. What's he up to?
          The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if
          they've just now noticed him.
          And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait,
          there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his
          other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
          The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE!
          The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames.
          Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through
          the night.
          The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of
          glass.
          Michael drops the gas pump.
          He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and
          unlocks the door.
          Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED

          BY A RING OF FIRE.

                              MICHAEL
                    Come with me.
          Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...
          Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.

                              MICHAEL
                    Run.

          

                                                                    76.

          

          
          And together they run toward the open diner door.

          BEHIND THEM THE MINIVAN EXPLODES.   A BALL OF FIRE ROARS AT

          THEM!

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing.
          Audrey is the first one in.
          Michael is almost there.   But the fire is faster, ENGULFING

          HIM IN FLAME!

                               CHARLIE
                    Michael!

                              BOB
                        (pulling Charlie away from
                         the door)
                    Get back!
          BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into
          the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF

          FIRE REACHES THEM.
          Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS
          covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey.
          Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess.   Jeep and Bob
          rush to pat him down.
          Audrey's coughing from the smoke.

                              CHARLIE
                    I'll get some water!
          Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.    She fills up
          a pitcher of water.
          She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher...
          And SCREAMS!
          The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her
          wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE.
          The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor.
          The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress
          outfit covering her pregnant belly.
          Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She
          frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.

          

                                                                       77.

          

          
          But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room
          to maneuver.

                                 YOUNG BOY
                       C'mon, don't be scared. I just
                       wanna play with your baby.
          That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter!
          The boy raises the knife to strike.
          Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in
          front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.
          CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's
          hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the
          blade.
          The knife CLATTERS to the ground.
          The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but
          there's no knife.
          Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
          THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.
          Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the
          boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.
          Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,
          guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.

                                 MICHAEL
                       Are you hurt?
          Charlie shakes her head no.

                                 CHARLIE
                       Where is he?!
          That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE

          DINER BACK INTO DARKNESS.

                                 JEEP'S VOICE
                       He's still in here!
          FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.
          LIGHTING under chairs.    Under tables.

                                 BOB'S VOICE
                       Where the fuck is he?!
          A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track
          the location of the sound.

          

                                                                       78.

          

          
          As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is
          heard in another.
          Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.      A TRAIL OF

          BLOOD.

                                JEEP
                      He's bleeding!

          THE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE

          BLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT...

          A WALL...
          Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD

          REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS.

                                BOB
                      What the fuck?

          SCREECH!   THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND

          LANDS ON BOB'S BACK.
          Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly
          strong arms away from his neck.

                                   JEEP
                      Dad!
          Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air.
          Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's
          back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.

                                   MICHAEL
                      Get ready!
          Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked
          creature into the air.
          Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
          GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.
          And then in moments...      All is QUIET.
          BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She
          WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.

                                   CHARLIE
                      Oh, no!
          Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down
          Charlie's legs.

                                                                 CUT TO:

          Inky darkness.   A flickering light emanates from within the
          diner.
          TITLE:   "December 25th - 3:33am"
          The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT

          Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with
          Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her
          legs. Pots of steaming water surround them.

                               AUDREY
                     What am I supposed to do? Just
                     `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I
                     automatically know how to do this!

                               MICHAEL
                     Just do as I say.

                               AUDREY
                     Yeah, but, how do you know how to
                     do this?!

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME

          Bob and Jeep keep watch.
          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger
          -- closer.
          Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.

                                BOB
                     What a way to bring a child into
                     the world.
                         (looks over at Jeep)
                     She ever tell you his name?

                               JEEP
                     She's never said. I just assumed
                     it was Joe Danvers. You know how
                     she's always had a thing for bad
                     boys.
          Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.

          

                                                                     80.

          

          

                              BOB
                    Jeep, sooner or later she'll
                    realize you're the best thing
                    that's ever happened to her.

                              JEEP
                    I thought you said I should move
                    on?

                              BOB
                    Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
          Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...
          A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as
          if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.

                              JEEP
                    What was that...?
          The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
          numbers.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

          Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him.
          Audrey arrives with more steaming water.

                              AUDREY
                    What is that?!

                              MICHAEL
                    He's coming. We have to hurry.

                              AUDREY
                    Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry?
                    This isn't something you can
                    exactly hurry, is it?

                              MICHAEL
                    Charlie, I need you to push. I
                    need you to push as hard as you
                    can.

                              AUDREY
                    Michael, who's coming?!
          Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with
          pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.

                              MICHAEL
                    We're almost there...

          

                                                                    81.

          Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
          closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks
          stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.

                              JEEP
                    We're not gonna make it outta here,
                    are we?
          Bob looks at his son.   The agony stretched across his face.

                              BOB
                    I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be
                    happening to you...
          Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob
          pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears
          filling his eyes.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final
          agonizing SCREAM...
          ...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES.   Audrey, eyes wide, holds
          up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.

                              AUDREY
                    Oh my god...we did it!    Charlie,
                    you did it!
          Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the
          baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace
          it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready
          to make, even at this late hour.

                              AUDREY

                        (CONFUSED)
                    It's okay. The baby's okay.
          Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.

                              CHARLIE
                    I don't...I...
          Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.

                              MICHAEL
                    Take him... Give her a minute.
          Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to
          soothe him by pacing around the diner.

          

                                                                        82.

          

          

                                AUDREY
                      It's okay...It's okay...Shhh...
          Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.      Menacing.
          Closer.
          Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
          trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out
          of the   STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
          SILENT   NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.
          Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.     She stares
          at him, a burning spite in her eyes.

                                CHARLIE
                      So are we safe now?   Is it over?

                                MICHAEL
                      No. Killing the child would have
                      ended the war before it had begun.
                      Now, at least, he will have a
                      chance to grow up, a chance to lead
                      the world out of darkness.
          Those words provide her little comfort.

                                CHARLIE
                      And what happens until then...?

                                MICHAEL
                      You'll need to teach him how.
          Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.

                                CHARLIE
                      What makes you think I can do that?
                      What makes you think I want to do
                      that? If he's so important, why
                      don't you take him?

                                MICHAEL
                      Each of us has a burden. This one
                      is yours and yours alone. Maybe
                      someday you'll understand what that
                      means.
          Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
          approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite
          how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to
          see her in such a demoralized state.

                                AUDREY
                      Mama? Can you hear me?
                          (holds up the baby)
                      We did it...The baby's alive.

                                (MORE)

          

                                                                   83.

          
                                 AUDREY (cont'd)

                        (BEAT)
                    Mama?
          If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face.
          Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her
          mother. But we HOLD here and...
          DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are
          loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's
          cut through her skin.

          

          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES
          reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about
          frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back
          away from the diner.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

          

          EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

          Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light
          above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in
          a desert town a long time ago.
          THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.
          All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of
          the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the
          further away from the diner we get.

          

          HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP
          In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of
          creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the
          truck stop.
          The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.

          AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.   LIKE A

          BIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME

          Jeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie
          to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of
          bloody blankets cradled in her arms.

                              JEEP
                    Something's happening.    They're
                    moving away.

          

                                                                       84.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    The Possessed can't come near the
                    child, so He sent someone that can.
                    Someone like me.

                                 BOB
                    Who?

                              MICHAEL
                    Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come
                    to do what I wouldn't.
          ON JEEP as the realization hits him.

                              JEEP
                    Your orders...
          Michael looks at Jeep.

                              JEEP
                    You were the one who was supposed
                    to kill the baby? That was the
                    order you didn't obey.
          Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael.

                              CHARLIE
                    What's he talking about?
          The baby CRIES LOUDER.

                              CHARLIE
                    Michael, what the hell's he talking
                    about?!

                              MICHAEL
                    There was never meant to be a
                    Second Coming. But we've just
                    changed that. The child lives.
                    The future is unwritten. There's
                    still hope.
          Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Audrey...?
          Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...

          ...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND

          SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!
          Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.
          Hers is the face of madness.

          

                                                                    85.

          

          

                               SANDRA
                     Stay away from me!    Don't come any
                     closer!

                                AUDREY
                     Mom!

                               BOB
                     Don't do it, lady!

                               SANDRA
                     You heard what he said. They just
                     want the baby. Maybe if we just
                     give it to them, then they'll let
                     us go!
          Michael cocks his gun.   Points it at Sandra.

          THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN

          THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
          Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.

                               CHARLIE
                     Give him to me!

                               SANDRA
                     Why?! You never wanted him in the
                     first place!
          Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
          rattling her to the very core.

                                CHARLIE
                     No...   I...
          Sandra is almost to the front door.

                               SANDRA
                     It's just one baby.   Just one.

          CRASH!   THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.
          A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.
          Sandra is blinded.   She raises a hand to block the light.
          And that's when Michael fires.    BLAM!
          Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her
          forehead, and...

          ...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!
          Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION...   And
          everything suddenly goes very QUIET.

          

                                                                     86.

          

          
          Michael fires again.   Blowing Sandra's body back through the
          doorway.
          Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.
          The time for Jeep to act is now!
          Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere
          inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...
          The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
          spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.
          Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
          diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.
          This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle
          scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly
          insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather
          they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.
          The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.
          And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his
          striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them
          for brothers.
          His name is GABRIEL.
          Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical
          looking MACE in his powerful hands.
          And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
          mace arcing down at Jeep.
          Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
          floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.
          Gabriel brings the mace up again.   Jeep won't be so lucky
          twice.

                              BOB (O.S.)
                    Sonuvabitch!
          Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.
          Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching
          himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind
          him.
          But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
          with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the
          child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she
          pulls the child protectively to her chest.

          

                                                                    87.

          

          
          Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around
          like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!
          Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.
          His gun falling from his hands.
          Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.

                               JEEP
                    No!
          With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the
          diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
          stove.
          Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
          the fray.

                               MICHAEL
                    No, Jeep! You must protect the
                    child now!

                               JEEP
                    Me?!   What about you?

                              MICHAEL
                    My path ends here. You are the
                    true protector. You always have
                    been.
          Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.

                              JEEP
                    But I don't know what to do!

                              MICHAEL
                    Find the Prophets.   Learn to read
                    the instructions.
          Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
          Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.

                              JEEP
                    Prophets? What Prophets?   What
                    instructions?!
          And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
          Michael's Police Cruiser.
          Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
          baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes
          his hand around the keys, determination building.

                               JEEP
                    C'mon!

          

                                                                  88.

          

          
          Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.

                                 CHARLIE
                    Wait!     We can't leave him!

                              JEEP
                    We have no choice!    We have to get
                    to Red Rock!
          He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.
          Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the
          ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.
          Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched
          hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a
          BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.
          Jeep is terrified.

                                 JEEP
                    Dad!
          Jeep tries to help him up.

                              BOB
                    Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here,
                    remember?

                              JEEP
                    But Dad...!
          Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:

                                 BOB
                    Run.
          And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.

          

          INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Audrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door.
          Charlie opens it.    Sand swirls in around her.
          And Jeep leads the trio out the door.

          

          INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME

          Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like
          enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
          family conflict.

          

                                                                    89.

          

          

                              MICHAEL
                    I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You
                    were always so eager to please Him.

                              GABRIEL
                    Unlike you...the rebellious son.
                        (noticing Michael's scars)
                    Pity about your wings. They would
                    have helped you now.

                              MICHAEL
                    To not feel their burden...is a
                    dream.

                              GABRIEL
                    You think you can defy Him and not
                    pay the price?

                              MICHAEL
                    The child lives. What happens to
                    me doesn't matter now.

                               GABRIEL
                    Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You
                    can help them sneak out the back
                    door, but they won't escape.

                    And neither will you, brother.
          Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.

                               MICHAEL

                        (SOFT)
                    I'm not running anymore.
          Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not
          what he was expecting.

                              MICHAEL

                        (SENSING)
                    Join with me. You don't need do
                    this. There's another way.
          A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.

                              GABRIEL
                    There is no other way...
          He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --
          LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it
          wasn't bad-ass enough.
          And the fight begins.

          

                                                                    90.

          

          
          It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems
          under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior
          weapon.
          With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering
          speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The
          place is getting absolutely shot to hell.
          Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
          the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.
          Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
          fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight
          into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in
          Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he
          lands on the counter.
          Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,
          sending him fluttering back.
          Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs
          again.
          Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support
          and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.
          Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.
          Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of
          punches.
          Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts
          his mace and thrusts with it.
          Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a
          wall.
          Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.
          A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
          back, losing his grip on the weapon.
          Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.
          Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael
          off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking
          the life out of Gabriel.

          It's in.
          Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.
          Panic.

                               CHARLIE
                     Come on, Jeep!

                               JEEP
                     I'm trying!
          Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING.
          A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light
          catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a
          SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely
          distended.
          Charlie screams.

                                JEEP
                     Fuck!
          Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!
          The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass

                               JEEP
                         (throwing the car in

                          REVERSE)
                     Hang on!
          Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards
          toward the highway.

          BUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON!
          Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full
          180 onto the road.

          THE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT.
          Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises
          from the pavement.
          Pedal to the metal.

          

                                                                  92.

          

          
          The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into
          him.
          BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over
          the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a
          cloud of dust.
          Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.

                              JEEP
                    Okay, we need to figure out our
                    weapon situation.   Hopefully
                    Michael didn't take everything out
                    of the car.
          Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a
          police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie
          searches under her seat.   Pulls out a...GRENADE.

                              CHARLIE
                    Is this what I think it is?

                             JEEP
                    Yes. Now just put it down...
                    Slowly.
          Charlie places it onto the seat.
          Audrey fishes around in the backseat.

                              AUDREY
                        (holding up each item)
                    Okay, all I got is a flare gun
                    thing. Looks like we got a box of
                    flares to go with it.

                               JEEP
                    Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A
                    a flare gun... And a grenade.
                    Alright.
                        (hands Charlie the Glock)
                    Load this.

                        (BEAT)
                    Audrey, can you figure out how to
                    load that flare gun without killing
                    us all?

                                 AUDREY
                    I can try.

                              JEEP
                    Try real hard, okay?
          Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.

          

                                                                     93.

          Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.    He
          fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.
          Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't
          hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.
          Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.
          Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom
          mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.
          Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.
          Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.
          Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.   It's a brutal
          struggle.
          Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms
          reach.
          He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this
          angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's
          strength is giving way. Michael is winning.
          Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the
          mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go
          wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them
          both through.
          Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.
          Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.   Right
          through his heart.
          Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly
          as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood
          left in this guy.
          Michael falls to his knees.   Weakening.
          Gabriel looms over Michael.   Michael looks up at him, blood
          leaking from his mouth.

                              GABRIEL
                    You always wanted to live like one
                    of them...Now you'll know how it
                    feels to die like one of them.
          Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head.
          Michael closes his eyes.   Submitting.
          The mace comes swinging down...

          

                                                                       94.

          She looks to Jeep in desperation, but something more
          frightening catches her attention.
          The INTRICATE WRITING is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm,
          snaking its way up from his wrists like VINES.

          Gabriel watches as the last of the writing FADES from

          somewhere in the diner.
          Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward
          the source of the CLICKING.
          He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive
          pool of blood.
          It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
          sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO.
          Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to
          lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...
          Bob looks at Gabriel.

                               BOB
                    Sorry...   We're closed.
          And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO

          IGNITES.
          Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of
          the stove's broken gas line.
          Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes.

          A STREAM OF FIRE ENGULFS HIM AS HIS WINGS UNFOLD AND HE LEAPS

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep, Charlie and Audrey slip frantically down in their seats
          as the roof presses down at them. The windows BURST.
          Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof.

          

                                                                     98.

          

          

          

          EXT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          Gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh, causing him to slide
          off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the
          rear window frame for support.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

          With tremendous strength, Gabriel pulls his upper body
          through the broken back window toward Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                    Jeep!
          Jeep swings the gun around.

                              JEEP
                    Duck!
          BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow
          him down.

                              JEEP
                    Audrey, the flare gun!
          Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding
          Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the
          risk of hitting Audrey.
          Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now.
          Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her
          hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes
          off INSIDE THE CAR!
          Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS
          through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July!
          Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the
          windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING

          HIS HAIR ABLAZE.
          And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE.
          BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear
          window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to
          pull himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down.
          Jeep pulls the trigger again and...CLICK.    No bullets!
          Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. Brings it up to
          fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the
          side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She's out cold.

          

                                                                     99.

          

          
          Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.
          Jeep knows there's only one thing to do.

                              JEEP
                    Get down on the floor!
          Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in
          front of the passenger seat.
          Jeep PUNCHES IT.   The speedometer leaps ahead.

          70...80...90...
          Gabriel's now completely in the car.   They're helpless.
          Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie,
          his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when...

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
                    Get off her, you fucking asshole!
          Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just
          in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides
          him like one helluva a cowboy.

          100...110...120...

                              AUDREY
                    Do it, Jeep! Do it now!

          JEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING

          FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET.
          The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road
          with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS

          The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and
          careening into a large rock formation.
          This ride is over.

          

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

          Jeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his
          forehead.
          Charlie crawls up from the floor.

                              CHARLIE
                    C'mon, Jeep!

          

                                                                    100.

          

          
          He tries to focus on her.

                                CHARLIE
                    Jeep!
          She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.

                                JEEP
                    The baby?

                                CHARLIE
                    Alive.

                              JEEP
                    And what about...

                              CHARLIE
                    Nothing could have survived that.

                              JEEP

                        (ANGUISHED)
                    Audrey...

                              CHARLIE
                    She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved
                    us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
          Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from
          the demolished Cruiser.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN

          Jeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the
          long climb up the ridge.
          Charlie looks up.
          STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking.

                              CHARLIE
                    How can this happen?

                                JEEP
                    What?

                               CHARLIE
                    How can this happen in a world so
                    beautiful?
          Jeep follows her gaze to the sky.
          Endless stars.    Confounding.
          Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.

          

                                                                    101.

          

          

                              JEEP
                    C'mon, we're almost there.
          They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --

          GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
          Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
          just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
          a cloud of dust.
          Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
          done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
          Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
          a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
          visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
          Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
          Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
          hand.
          Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
          rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
          knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
          Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
          Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
          again.
          Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his
          fists. This kid will simply not give up.
          Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
          shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
          off the ground.

                              GABRIEL
                    So brave. So pointless. You
                    should have worried more about
                    saving yourself.
          Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
          Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.
          Charlie watches in horror.

                               CHARLIE
                    Stop!   Please! Don't kill him!
          But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
          consciousness. The battle is lost.

                              GABRIEL
                    Go to sleep...
          Jeep's eyes flutter.   He's almost gone.

          

                                                                   102.

          

          

                               CHARLIE
                    Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!
          This gets Gabriel's attention.
          Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
          him.

                              CHARLIE
                    I don't want this responsibility!
          Tears run down her face.   She's dead fucking serious.
          Gabriel lets go of Jeep.   He falls to the ground, gasping
          desperately for air.

                              JEEP
                    Charlie, no!
          Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.

                              GABRIEL
                    "And as the child's cries are
                    extinguished, an eternal darkness
                    at last descended upon the world."
          He peels the cloth back, revealing...

          THE GRENADE.
          He spins around to face Charlie.
          She's holding the pin.

          KABOOM!

          GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.
          The creature is gone at last.
          The sound of a BABY COOING.
          Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
          She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
          their way to the top of the ridge.

          

          EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN

          Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.
          ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.
          Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.

          

                                                                      103.

          

          

                               JEEP
                     We made it.

                               CHARLIE
                     Yep, we sure did.
          And now we see it too:

          

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
          Vast.   Barren.   No signs of life.
          No resistance force.    No nothing.

          

          ON JEEP AND CHARLIE
          Taking it in.     Breathing hard.

                               JEEP
                     I'm sure they're just over the next
                     ridge.
          He glances at Charlie.    Worry in her eyes.

                               CHARLIE
                     What if we're on our own now?

                                JEEP
                     Don't be afraid.    We'll be okay.

                         (BEAT)
                     Believe me.
          At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes.       Sees a
          confidence in them she's never seen before.
          And she leans in and kisses him.      Tender.
          When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise.      Then
          the surprise melts into a smile.
          And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a
          view once again of --

          

          THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
          A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The
          unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat.
          And we're back where we started.
          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.

          

                                                                   104.

          

          

          IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    Someday when my son is older, I
                    will tell him about the time of his
                    birth when all the world was
                    covered in a great darkness...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER

          Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the
          experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the
          INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is
          gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... And how just at the moment when
                    everything seemed lost...
          Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
          It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy
          family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
          WEAPONRY in the back seat.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    ...a mighty warrior fell in order
                    to save me.
          Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby.   He smiles at the
          image of maternal bliss.

                              CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    And a boy faced his fear and rose
                    up to save us all.
          The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with
          its fiery light.

     FACE IN ON

     THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER

     Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers
     of fish and marine life...

     A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current,
     their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison.
     Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
     school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the
     shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened,
     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
     seconds before.

     WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER

     Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless
     where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten
     thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating
     echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly
     WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES...

                                JONES
                   Burritos...Enchiladas...

                                DEJESUS
                                (hispanic voice)
                   Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that
                   stuff?...

                                BOWMAN
                                (female)
                   I can't wait for fresh vegetables...

     Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?"
     "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the
     others.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, cut the chatter.  You're
                   not out of here, yet.  Who's the
                   hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on
                   container 22?

     A pause, then more voices.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                                (redneck drawl)
                   The man's asking if you're hooked
                   on 22, you dumb shit.

                                JONES' VOICE/ RADIO
                   Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello,
                   Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook,
                   over.

     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an
     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and
     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front
     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights
     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE
     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                                (woman's voice)
                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.

     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM

     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion
     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at
     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,
     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-
     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.
     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his
     way.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container
                   and call it a day.

     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with
     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a
     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and
     throws a console switch which activates another monitor
     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside
     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is
     moving.

     UNDERWATER

     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED
     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,
     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.

     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes
     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is
     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on
     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool
     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from
     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE
                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a
                   tit or something?  We're all
                   waiting on you, honey.

                                WILLIE
                                (under control)
                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.
                   I promise you'll be inside before
                   "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.

     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They
     like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta
     girl," etc...

     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she
     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what
     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER
     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the
     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in
     by a winch.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready
                   to winch.

     UNDERWATER MACHINERY

     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding
     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.
     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.

                                BECK/ RADIO
                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.

     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights
     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:
     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.

     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will
     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human
     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the
     building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign
     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.

     ON ONE OF THE CREW

     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his
     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the
     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA
     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.

     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical
     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick
     movement, snares it.

     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the
     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE
     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on
     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has
     noticed then continues on toward the shack.

     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)

     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,
     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an
     exaggerated accent.

                                DEJESUS
                   When it's time to relax....
                   One thing stands clear...

     INSIDE ON BECK

     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see
     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated
     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He
     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.

                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)
                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to
                   hurry through...

     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair
     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs
     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously
     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand
     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS
     OUT.

     DEJESUS' POV

     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring
     vital signs.

                                DEJESUS
                   ...beer after beer...

     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze
     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   Oh, shit...

                                JONES/ RADIO
                                (to DeJesus)
                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.

                                DEJESUS
                                (rising terror)
                   Jonesy!  I'm losing compression...
                   I'm going to blow my suit, man!
                   Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...

     INSIDE

     Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but
     there is a definite tremble in his voice.

                                BECK
                   Give me a readout, DeJesus.

                                DEJESUS(ON RADIO)
                                (gripped with panic)
                   Ahhhh!

     OUTSIDE

     The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.

                                BECK (ON RADIO)
                   DeJesus!  A readout!

                                JONES
                   He don't need a readout,
                   man, he needs help!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                                (anything but calm)
                   Stay calm!

                                BOWMAN
                   Calm!?  Where's Doc?

     INSIDE

     Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.

                                BECK
                                (trying to
                                keep control)
                   The internal monitors read
                   normal.

     ON THE MINERS, PANICKED

                                COBB
                   Where's Doc?!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   He's not at his station.

                                DEJESUS
                                (panicked)
                   Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive
                   me of my--

                                BECK'S VOICE
                                (making a decision)
                   Get him into the Shack.

     DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  "15, 14,
     13..."  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the
     last few yards to the SHACK.

     INSIDE/SHACK - SAME

     ON BECK  sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments
     and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same
     countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...

     OUTSIDE

     ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater
     elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside
     his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.

     ON BECK

     DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room.
     Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it
     again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by
     the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving!
     Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.

     INSIDE/LIFT LOCK

     WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the
     Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.

     CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then
     suddenly they flutter.  He's alive!

     THE MESS - LATER

     The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess
     features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL
     PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board
     obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"...

     A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE
     MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft
     drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he
     looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES,
     Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a
     mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she
     has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE,
     twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist.
     DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still
     shaken from his experience.

     The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the
     ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.

                                BOWMAN
                   I'm telling you, it's the suits!

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits, it's the people
                   monitoring them.  It Doc had been
                   there like he's supposed to it never
                   would've happened!

                                SIXPACK
                   And just what the fuck would he
                   have done to stop it, huh?

     Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the
     empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a
     huge belch.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   That would have been you, DeJesus...

     DeJesus keeps his head down.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   Yeah...I was standing next to a guy
                   who blew a suit once in the
                   Indian Ocean...little tiny hole
                   in the fucking toe of his suit
                   ...ocean came in and the
                   pressure crammed his whole
                   fucking body up into his helmet.
                   They just buried his helmet.

                                DEJESUS
                                (coldly)
                   I know all about implosion, man.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, I bet you do.
                                (laughs)
                   I bet you were imploding in
                   your pants.
                                (laughs then imitates
                                a hysterical DeJesus)
                   Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me!

     DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO

     BECK - SAME

     Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.

                                BECK
                   Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know
                   it's been a long month for every-
                   one, but we can't let something
                   like this tear us apart...

     Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we
     see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters.

     Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
     look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.

                                BECK
                   Shit...

     He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
     college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking
     father.  Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute
     Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
     underwater mining.

     He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC
     GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems
     shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.

     MESS

     The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold.
     All eyes go to the ceiling and walls.

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits man...this
                   place is going to kill us first.

     Just as suddenly as it began the GROANING NOISE STOPS and in
     its place WE HEAR an intermittent RATTLE in the air system.
     Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.

                                DEJESUS
                                (listening)
                   There it is again...
                                (sitting down again)
                   Two more days.  I tell myself
                   'you can make it two more days--'

                                BOWMAN
                   What's the weather like up top?

                                WILLIE
                   Clear for pickup.

                                JONES
                   Let's hope it holds.

     Cobb looks up disgustingly.

                                COBB
                   Then what?  Huh?
                                (to everyone)
                   Then what?  You folks think
                   going up top's the answer to
                   all your problems.  Well, it ain't.

                                BOWMAN
                   Give us a break, Cobb...

                                COBB
                   A break?  You folks don't need a break,
                   you need psychiatrists.  'Know what
                   you'd be doing if you were up there,
                   right now?

                                SIXPACK
                                (a boorish leer)
                   Eating pussy and drinking brew...

                                COBB
                   Eating pussy my ass.  What about
                   lines at the bank:  What about
                   getting stuck in traffic?

                                SIXPACK
                                (grinning)
                   Wherever I can find it.

     Everyone laughs but Cobb, WE SEE he's serious.

                                COBB
                   Bullshit!  I'll tell you
                   what you'd be doing!  You'd
                   be watching news on TV
                   that's so fucking bad it
                   makes you nauseous.  So you
                   go out and get in your car
                   to get some fresh air and
                   after you've been driving for
                   five minutes you realize the
                   air's so damn dirty you don't dare
                   breath it!  That's what you've
                   got to look forward to...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR

     Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb
     ranting inside.

                                COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   ...And if you're lucky
                   enough to make it back home
                   to your house that looks the
                   fucking same as everyone else's,
                   you'll find your wife's just as
                   fat as she was when you left and
                   the only reason your kids ain't
                   strung out on the drugs they were
                   using when you left is that
                   they've found some new drugs
                   which fuck 'em up even more!...
                   You people just don't appreciate
                   how good you've got down here...

     BECK hesitates at the door to the Mess, as though screwing
     up his courage, then takes a deep breath and enters as we

                                                        CUT TO

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet.
     Beck notices Doc's empty chair.

                                BECK
                   Doc eat already?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor hasn't showed yet.

     Looks are exchanged.  Sixpack smirks knowingly.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   How do you feel, DeJesus?

                                DEJESUS
                                (obviously embarrassed
                                to be singled out)
                   Okay.

                                BECK
                   Better let the Doc take a
                   look at you, after dinner.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, since he was busy earlier
                   when you needed him.

     He cracks up and Beck turns on him.

                                BECK
                   Cut it, Sixpack.

     Sixpack shuts up, but Beck notices the others feel the
     seriousness of Doc's absence during the emergency.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Leave the Doc to me.  I'm
                   going to talk to him.

                                SIXPACK
                                (sarcastically, under his
                                breath to Bowman)
                   'Makes me feel better already...

     Beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about
     something else.  He clears his throat.

                                 BECK
                   I've been looking at the duty
                   roster...at the shack hours
                   outstanding...

                                 JONES
                   Uh, oh...I see where this
                   is going...

                                 BECK
                                 (ignoring Jones)
                   ...all of you owe time and I
                   thought tonight would be a good
                   time to---

                                 COBB
                                 (erupting)
                   No way, Mister Beck!  No
                   fucking way!  We just did a
                   full shift, you can't call
                   Shack duty on top of a full
                   shift.  It's a contract violation!

                                 JONES
                   Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's
                   hear it for our shop Steward!

                                 SIXPACK
                   Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck?
                   Company got to abide by the rules.

     FIVE FACES STARE AT BECK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS.
     THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY.

                                BECK
                   I know all about the contract.
                   The point is you can follow the
                   goddamn contract to the letter and pull
                   your shack duty tomorrow...or you
                   can get it done tonight and call
                   tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you.

     This leaves the group momentarily speechless.  Even DeJesus
     comes out of his stupor.

                                DEJESUS
                   You giving us a day off?

     Beck nods.  Cobb eyes him suspiciously.

                                COBB
                   What about our quota?

                                BECK
                   You're only twenty-five
                   tons off quota.  Barring an
                   unforeseen problem you should
                   reach it easily on the last day.
                                (he looks at the group)
                   It's just a day off.  You don't
                   have to take it, I just thought it
                   might help.

     The others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need
     anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind.

                                JONES
                   Count me in.

     Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree.
     Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike...

                                BECK
                   Cobb, Jones, I want you to do
                   something about that damn rattle
                   in the air system...
                                (to Bowman and Sixpack)
                   Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...

                                SIXPACK
                                (disgustedly)
                   Shit...

                                BECK
                   Williams...get DeJesus' suit on
                   the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.
                                (to group)
                   Any other suit problems she should
                   know about?

     Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses.

                                SIXPACK
                                (to Willie)
                   My pocket.  Check my pocket,
                   will ya, honey?

                                WILLIE
                                (annoyed)
                   Your pocket?

                                SIXPACK
                   The latch is screwed up.  Or
                   the hinge.

                                WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                   Right.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds
     himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously
     uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together.
     She smiles, friendly, at ease.

                                WILLIE
                   You did good...

                                BECK
                                (a little surprised)
                   What?

                                WILLIE
                   Today...with DeJesus.  That
                   was smart thinking to get him
                   inside...

                                BECK
                   There probably wasn't anything
                   wrong with his suit...

                                WILLIE
                   Still...you did the right thing.

     She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny,
     but honest compliment.  He savors it.

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy
     bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and
     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is
     spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we
     saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.

     Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a
     motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked,
     laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked
     screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the
     control switch and hits the START button.

     NNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track
     toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it
     says:  DEJESUS.

     DOC'S OFFICE - SAME

     Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting
     on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been
     quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.

                                DOC
                   I must have dozed off.

     Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad
     Whiskey.  He picks it up.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Snakebite medicine...Never
                   pack my bag without it.

     Beck doesn't smile.  He puts the bottle back down and Doc
     watches him in the mirror.

                                BECK
                   Are you planning on working tomorrow?

                                DOC
                   Well, I'll be on the golf course
                   in the morning.  Then, if I don't
                   have any babies to deliver--

                                BECK
                                (cutting him off)
                   We almost had an accident today.
                   DeJesus' suit...

     The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck.

                                DOC
                   You got something to say to me, son?...

     Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he
     falters.

                                BECK
                   I...I think it's important to
                   have the second officer on deck.

     Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.

                                DOC
                   I'll keep it to nine holes
                   in the morning.

     THE DORMITORY - SAME

     Small but functional.  The bunks can be closed-off with a
     privacy door.  Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
     otherwise sterile environment.

     Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
     maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which
     proclaims:  "I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET."
     DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's
     has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for;
     Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he
     is instead of somewhere else.  Inside Jones' bunk is an
     indoor basketball goal.

     Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
     sponge and pail.  Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on
     Bowman's chest.

                                SIXPACK
                   Christ...what a pair...

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   What was that?  What'd you say?

                                SIXPACK
                   I said, "What a pair" the
                   boy wonder Shack Boss and his
                   drunken doctor buddy make...
                                (innocently)
                   Why?  What did ya think I said?

     CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big
     plate on the floor with a power wrench.  Overhead a huge
     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
     system.  The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.

     Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the
     floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark
     and wet.  Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is
     much louder and sinister.

                                JONES
                   Listen to it for Christsake.

                                COBB
                   Ah, it's just old, like me.
                   You don't see the Doc opening
                   me up every time I get a new creak
                   in my joints...I say, as long as
                   it's recycling the air let
                   the next shift deal with it.
                   But, 'long as we're here...

     He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
     it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs
     down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones.  Jones
     seems in no hurry to accompany him.

                                COBB(cont'd)
                   You gonna sit there on your
                   butt or give me a hand?

     Jones reluctantly starts down after him.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Beck in his quarters.  He seems to be talking to himself but
     as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
     monitor.  On screen we see MARTIN, 30's, a slick
     bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp. whose face is
     all we see on the video monitor.

                                BECK
                   Two hundred and fifty-two
                   tons of Magnesium and 15 tons
                   of Sodium.

                                MARTIN
                                (taking notes)
                   Sounds like a good week, Beck.
                   In fact...I put your folder
                   in front of the Vice President
                   of District Operations last night...

     Beck stops.  Martin notices his concern.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   You're good executive timber,
                   Beck.  A lot of management trainees
                   wash out when they have to go under
                   for their first tour.  But you've done well.

                                BECK
                                (smiles, relieved)
                   Thank you, Martin.

                                MARTIN
                   Don't thank me, yet, but it is
                   important to know where you're
                   going and who your friends are...
                   'Know what I mean?

     He stares hard at Beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   The one thing I've learned in
                   this company is you can't have
                   enough friends.  It's the only
                   way to survive.

     CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's
     Rocky Mountain High.

     DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
     works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal
     box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS.

     SWAMP - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic
     computer and is going through the computerized
     checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of
     possible problems.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself)
                   Probably a short.

     Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical
     Short.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Good guess, Williams.

     She types in a "help" command and the computer screen
     displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
     Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Piece of cake.

     She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and
     pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With
     two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces
     the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and
     the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds
     the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes.
     The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans
     over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming
     machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
     hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.

                                COBB
                   Okay, watch this..

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound
     in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops
     directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the
     pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE
     AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     Jones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's
     all it took.  Cobb starts gathering up the tools.

                                JONES
                   So that's all you do?...

                                COBB
                   Shhhh...don't tell no one.
                                (winks)
                   Job security.

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket
     in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She
     pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens.
     Nothing.

                                WILLIE
                                (miffed)
                   Nothing wrong with this...

     SUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the
     workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie.  She
     backs away and it drops into the water at her feet.

     THE DORMITORY

     Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to
     Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                                (over intercom)
                   Fuck you, Sixpack!  You think
                   you're funny?  You're not funny!

     ON BECK

     He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom.

                                BECK
                   This is Beck.  Is there a
                   problem, Williams?

     SWAMP

     Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her
     as Beck's words come over the P.A.  Ignoring Beck she
     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
     the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS
     skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the
     skewered sea spider out of the water.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   A little problem, sir...but I've
                   got a handle on it now.

                                           TIME CUT TO:

     THE MESS - LATER

     BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches
     stock prices scroll across the screen.  Every so often she
     freezes a stock and types the command:  INFO.  The screen
     immediately changes to a financial report of the company in
     question as if prepared by a broker.  In a matter of seconds
     Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company.

     Across the room from her, Willie exercises with dumbbells
     while she studies an astronaut training manual.  She looks up
     at Bowman.

                                WILLIE
                   Made your million, yet?

                                BOWMAN
                                (studying the screen)
                   Not yet.

                                WILLIE
                   How's TransOcean doing?

     This causes Bowman to turn and look at Willie.

                                BOWMAN
                   You got money in this tub?

                                WILLIE
                   I signed-up for the stock option.

     Bowman shakes her head and goes back to the computer and
     types in TransOcean Corp.

     DORMITORY

     ON COBB  He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp, but wears a
     T-shirt and long pants.  DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a
     snow covered Swiss mountain scene.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, man, you know that in
                   Switzerland--and this country's
                   the size of East L.A., okay?--they
                   speak 54 different dialects?
                   Fifty-four!

                                COBB
                   Who cares?

                                DEJESUS
                   I do, man.  That's a beautiful
                   place.  When I get out of here
                   I'm going there.  Find a nice
                   little snow covered chalet, warm
                   little woman, crackling fire--

     He looks up and sees Cobb's sunbathing attire and laughs.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you
                   take off your shirt and pants,
                   man?  You should do that wearing
                   what you're going to wear at the
                   beach.

                                COBB
                                (sharply)
                   This is what I wear at the
                   beach, goddamnit.

     MESS - SAME

     COMPUTER SCREEN  The report appears on screen with a
     capsulized history of the TransOcean company, its philosophy
     and growth plans and most current financial report.  A final
     column called "insider tips" says:

                                BOWMAN
                                (reading)
                   "Major development in
                   South Indian Ocean set for
                   fall of 2010..."
                                (to Willie)
                   That sounds interesting, but they're
                   too tied to their holdings.  Remember
                   a year ago when they lost that tanker?...
                   The bottom fell out of their stock and
                   I lost a bloody fortune.  That's
                   when I decided to diversify.

     Willie looks at Bowman a moment, then keeps exercising.

                                WILLIE
                   You take your money, too
                   seriously, Bo.

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   You're damn right I do.  Five
                   years down here and I'll pull
                   in more than 15 topside.  I'm not
                   down here for the fun, I'll tell
                   you that.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   "Fun?"  Somebody talking fun?

     They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing
     only a robe.  With a leer he stares at Willie exercising.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                                (saccharine sweet)
                   Hey, Willie, honey...Sorry about that
                   little incident tonight...Everyone's
                   been so tight lately, I thought
                   a little humor'd loosen us all up,
                   you know?

     Willie doesn't bite, she looks hard at Sixpack.

                                WILLIE
                   Get out of here, Sixpack.

     Sixpack smirks.  He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the
     Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully.

                                SIXPACK
                                (leaving)
                   I got a date with an angel...

     CLANK, BANK, CLUNK.  A coke can tumbles noisily from the
     Coke machine.  Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes
     out of the Galley with a snack.  He stops in front of
     Bowman and the computer.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Bo...when're you going to
                   be off that thing?  I want to
                   find out tonight's NBA scores
                   and check the weather.

                                BOWMAN
                                (not taking her eyes off
                                 the screen, answers him)
                   The weather's good, I already
                   checked, but I'll be off in a minute.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Jones)
                   Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power
                   forward in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                   Jameson?  Who're you trying to
                   con?

     They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves.

     DORMITORY

     Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of
     Coke across the room to DeJesus.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off
                   tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get
                   shit-faced!

     DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of
     carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   How about you, brother Cobb?
                   Little Wild Turkey?

     Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker,
                   from way back.  Ain't that right
                   Cobbie?

     Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes.
     Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly
     ritual.

                                COBB
                   You guys are crazy.  What
                   the hell you play that stupid
                   game for?

                                DEJESUS
                                (acting drunk)
                   What game, Cobb?...I'm on
                   my way to Nirvana...

                                COBB
                   You're on your way somewhere
                   all right...the looney bin.

                                DEJESUS
                                (laughing)
                   I'm on the way to the looney
                   bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude
                   sun bathing in his clothes.

     INT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME

     CLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the
     centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position
     representing mad desire.

     Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
     photo.

                                SIXPACK
                   Oh, Darlin'...come sit on
                   my face...

     He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The
     SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead.

     Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
     against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming.
     He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
     in more pain.

     The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his
     sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to
     stare.

                                SIXPACK
                   That bitch!

     MESS

     Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He
     points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move
     up to watch.

                                SIXPACK
                                (moving into room)
                   Bitch!  Look what you did!

                                WILLIE
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   Sorry, darling...Just thought a
                   little humor would loosen us all
                   up...you know?...

     Everyone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes.
     He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward
     Willie.

                                SIXPACK
                   You think you're so funny?
                   Wait till you taste this!

     As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE
     behind him makes him freeze.

                                BECK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   That's enough!

     Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway.

                                SIXPACK
                   Look at my foot, sir!  This
                   bitch put a goddamn sea
                   monster in my bunk!

                                BECK
                                (cold as ice)
                   How do you know it was Williams?

                                SIXPACK
                                (trapped)
                   Huh?  I...uh...uh...

                                BECK
                   All right, Sixpack, you and
                   Williams are gonna pull water
                   duty tomorrow--

                                SIXPACK AND WILLIE
                                (protesting)
                   Bullshit!  What?!  She...He...

                                BECK
                                (cutting them off)
                   At ease!  You both have a half
                   day...Anymore shit and its a full
                   one.

     CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING

     SCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in
     place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words
     "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of
     cereal and holds his head in mock misery.

                                JONES
                   Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud.
                   Turn down the music.

                                COBB
                   What music?  There ain't no
                   music.

     DeJesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side
     of Cobb.

                                DEJESUS
                   Oooooh.

     Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're
     doing.

                                COBB
                   You know it's really crazy to
                   pretend to be drunk, but it's
                   fucking insane to pretend
                   to have a hangover.

                                BOWMAN
                                (to Jones and DeJesus)
                   Your "hangovers" made you miss
                   the Sixpack Good Morning Show.
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   "No goddamn boy is going to make
                   me go out on a down day."

                                JONES
                                (grinning)
                   Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?

                                COBB
                                (pleased)
                   Pretty good.  He sent them
                   out videotaping outcrop.

     UNDERWATER - SAME

     CLOSE ON  A whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the
     end of Willie's mechanical suit arm.  Like a drill its
     diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core
     sample.  It's a sinister hand-attachment, something Captain
     Hook would have loved.

     Above her the ROV maneuvers into position for a better view.

     INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL - SAME

     Beck is in the control station, staring at the video
     monitors--the image from the ROV.  Willie removes a slender
     instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump
     motion, CHUNK, CHUNK...activates an explosive charge.  She
     puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off.

                                BECK
                   Charge set?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Charge set.  Backing off.
                                (to the ROV)
                   C'mon Rover let's get out
                   of here.

     Like a good dog, the ROV follows her to a safe position.

     ON MONITOR  THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SPOT.  SUDDENLY THE
     GROUND SHAKES VIOLENTLY ON THE MONITOR SCREEN--A MINI
     EARTHQUAKE CHARGE.

     WILLIE RETURNS TO THE SITE OF THE CHARGE AND REINSERTS HER
     DRILL, EASILY REMOVING A TEST SAMPLE.

     Willie holds out the sample to the ROV so Beck can see
     inside.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM/ CLOSE ON BECK'S ROV MONITOR

     He stares at the image on the screen.

                                BECK
                   I need more light on that, Four.

     OUTSIDE

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   Roger...
                                (to Sixpack)
                   More light, Sixpack...

     There is no answer.  Willie turns around.  Her helmet lamp
     eerily illuminating the darkness around her.  Sixpack is
     nowhere to be seen.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Sixpack?

     She turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding
     lights are turned on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Boo!

     Sixpack laughs.  His lights now on, he stands right behind
     her.

                                WILLIE
                   You shit....

                                BECK'S VOICE
                   What's going on, Four?  What's
                   happening?

                                WILLIE
                   We're fine, Shack.  His lights
                   malfunctioned for a minute.  How's
                   this?

     She again holds out her hand to the ROV.

     INSIDE SHACK

     Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start
     the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.

                                BECK
                   That's great.  Now let's move
                   35 degrees southwest.

     WILLIE AND SIXPACK MOVING

                                WILLIE
                                (to Sixpack)
                   You screw around like that again and--

                                SIXPACK
                   What's wrong, did you miss me?

                                WILLIE
                   Hardly.

                                SIXPACK
                   Don't worry, darlin, I'm...

     Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides.

     Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
     turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio
     goes dead.

     INSIDE ON BECK

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?!  What happened?

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is
     blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?!  Sixpack...

     Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet.
     The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers.

     BECK'S VOICE brings Willie back.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Willie?  What's going on?

                                WILLIE
                   He's gone.  I think he's
                   fallen.  I'm going down after him.

     MESS

     Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact
     gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's it Jonesy...Sweat it
                   out, man...Got to get the poison
                   out of our blood.

     Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight,
     suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in.

                                BOWMAN
                   Sixpack is lost.

     CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

     Bowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room
     where they are joined by Cobb.

                                COBB
                   Weren't they tied?  They're
                   supposed to be tied.

     They all enter the

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair.

                                JONES
                   How far away is she?

                                DOC
                   Two hundred meters.

     WILLIE'S VOICE silences them.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...nearing the
                   bottom.  Look at this...

     They all stare at the monitor.  The screen is filled with
     huge waving tubers.

                                DOC
                   My God, look at the size of
                   those tubers....

                                DEJESUS
                   Nine, ten feet high...

                                BOWMAN
                   If he had his blinkers on--

                                JONES
                   It wouldn't make any difference in
                   there...He could be two feet away and
                   on fire and she'd still not see him!

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves through the dense waving forest of
     giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves
     slowly.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?

     CONTROL ROOM

                                BECK
                   Why can't we pick up his signal?

                                DEJESUS
                                (a joke)
                   Maybe he got eaten?

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What would be dumb enough to
                   eat Sixpack?

     ON WILLIE

     She moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the
     sight in front of her.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...you picking
                   this up?

     INSIDE

     All eyes suddenly go to the monitor.  A huge dark maw fills
     the screen.

                                BECK
                   Affirmative...Widening picture.

     The image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a
     huge gash in the side of a sunken ship.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                                (to DOC)
                   Tighten the picture on the
                   upper righthand corner.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR:  The picture zooms in on the corner
     and Willie's added light suddenly brings the letter "M" into
     focus.

     Beck presses the red record button and pans the ROV slowly
     across the bulkhead of the ship.  The next letter is an "A".
     Then suddenly a Cyrillic letter appears, then others.

                                COBB
                   What the?...

                                DOC

                   I'm going inside.

                                BECK
                   What's your air reading?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Twenty minutes...

                                BECK
                   Twenty minutes!...Who had
                   tank duty?

                                BOWMAN
                   Who else...Sixpack.

                                JONES
                   The man is unbelievable...
                   I say, leave him in there.

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What about his suit?  That's
                   a million five the company's
                   got to replace.  They'll make
                   somebody go get it.

                                BECK
                                (to Willie)
                   Willie, we're giving you five
                   minutes...after that we're coming in.

     WILLIE'S POV

     Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of
     her mask.  She moves along steadily down darkened corridors.
     She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a
     cloud of sludge rises off the bottom.  The room looks empty.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?...Answer me.

     She throws open another door.  It also looks empty, then
     WHAM! a grotesque ECHONODERM slams into her helmet.  Willie
     bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light
     into the room.

     WHAT SHE SEES:  The ship's infirmary.  Broken glass,
     stainless steel...the light does strange things, reflecting,
     sparkling...

                                WILLIE(ON RADIO)
                   The infirmary...

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Three minutes...

     Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time, then
     as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white
     in the corner--A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE SKELETON.  Willie doesn't
     see it.

     INT. THE CONTROL ROOM

     CLOSE ON DOC  He stares at the monitor screen.  Did he see
     something or were his eyes playing tricks?  He looks across
     the console and sees the videotape is recording.

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves to the end of the hall.  It ends with
     two doors.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   One minute.

     Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on
     her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His
     mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the
     ship's huge safe.

                                SIXPACK
                                (laughing)
                   I'm rich, honey.  Rich!

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG!
     BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a
     chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case
     with Beck.

                                SIXPACK
                   It's all mine if I'm on report.
                   Otherwise you gotta take me off
                   report before you look at any more...
                   Ain't that right, Cobbie?

                                COBB
                   You're on your own, Sixpack, you
                   fucked up everybody's day off...

     DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box
     and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets,
     wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who
     stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory.

                                BOWMAN
                   Personal effects...

                                WILLIE
                                (considering
                                a watch)
                   Timex...

     She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and
     tosses it to Cobb.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Here's something for you, Cobbie.

                                JONES
                                (checking a wallet)
                   Russian money...Don't look like much.

     Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the
     table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman
     in a bathing suit.  Bowman looks at it.

                                BOWMAN
                                (grinning to
                                Sixpack)
                   Yeah, I'd say you can retire
                   with all this loot.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shut up.

     Everyone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped
     object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video
     tape.  He looks at the label.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                                (reading)
                   "Debbie Does Dallas"...
                                (looks up and
                                grins)
                   Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't
                   read it...

                                DOC
                   May I see it?

     Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                   It's a log of some sort.

     Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it
     out--Papers, more cheap watches.

     ON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a
     paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he
     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off
     the table out of sight.

     Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the
     table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught
     by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor
     bottle.

                                WILLIE
                   Vodka.

                                DEJESUS
                   Probably confiscated.  No
                   booze on board, same as us.

     Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read
     the label.

                   Serbo Croat and a smattering of
                   Swahili...standard pre-med background...

     Cobb stares at him a second then:

                                COBB
                   Bullshit.

                   ...and a Russian grandmother...

     Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman.

                                BECK
                   I want all this stuff impounded
                   in the supply safe.

     He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus' hands.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...except this...it goes in my
                   safe.

     A disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle.  Doc
     stops him.

                                (leaving)
                   Be my guest.

     RING CORRIDOR - LATER

     The gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary.  It is empty,
     silent.  Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly
     and Bowman peeks out.  Seeing the corridor is empty she
     slips out with a a manila folder.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Bowman hands the envelope to DeJesus, who's grinning
     delightedly.

                                DEJESUS
                   You got 'em!

     Sixpack and Jones are there too.  Sixpack scowls.

                                SIXPACK
                   What good's the kid's med
                   records anyway!

                                DEJESUS
                   Watch and learn, amigo...

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN

     We see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a RUSSIAN
     SHIP'S CAPTAIN talking to the camera in Russian.  The tape
     is of poor quality and water spotted.

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                                (translating)
                   Another party last night.  More
                   Vodka.  The infirmary is filled
                   as it is.  I confiscate what
                   I can, but I know the Government
                   Observers have more...

     Suddenly, the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to
     the camera and turns it off.  The tape goes blank.

     ON DOC

     He stops the tape and presses another button on the console.
     WILLIE'S VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship
     appears on another screen.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   See that gash?  The way the
                   edges protrude inward is like
                   from a torpedo explosion.  It
                   couldn't have come from within.
                   Like an accident.

     He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and
     has also been watching the tape.  Beck looks at Doc and
     shrugs.

                                BECK
                   What do you want me to say?
                   That it all sounds mysterious?

                                DOC
                   These observers were doing something.
                   A test...I think they sank that ship
                   on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

                                BECK
                   What mistakes?
                                (he shakes his
                                head wearily)
                   Look, I think it's no big deal but
                   if you want to find out why this
                   ship sank have Maritime run a check.

     He gets up and goes to the door.  Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I did.  They have no record of
                   the wreck.

                   The Marshal Goloviev is now on
                   a tour in the Baltic Sea.

     Beck stops.  This is a mystery.

     CLOSE ON COMBINATION LOCK/ BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Fingers fiddle with the combination.  He pulls on the
     handle.  The safe doesn't budge.

                                DEJESUS
                                (whisper)
                   It's not the phone number...

     We pull back to see that DeJesus is alone in Beck's darkened
     quarters, he talks to the P.A.  Suddenly we hear BOWMAN'S
     VOICE over the intercom.

                                BOWMAN'S VOICE
                                (on intercom)
                   Okay, try the social security
                   number...

     DeJesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, give it to me...

                   I want your permission to
                   check that vodka.

     Beck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc,
     with the vodka, but he's diplomatic.

                                BECK
                   This is a mining shack, not
                   a lab, Doc.  If there's something
                   strange with the vodka it's safe
                   till we get back.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR

     ON COBB  Standing watch for DeJesus.  Suddenly the door to
     the Control room opens and Beck walks out.  Cobb grabs a
     walkie-talkie.

                                COBB
                   Beck's coming.

     BECK'S QUARTERS/ ON DEJESUS

     He hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped
     quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places.

     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY

     They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A.

     ON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR

     Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong, Cobb?

                                COBB
                                (struggling)
                   Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air
                   recirculating system, sir...

                                BECK
                   What's wrong with it?

                                COBB
                                (thinking fast)
                   ...I'd really have to show it to
                   you.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   All right...

     Cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up
     the videotape.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...Just let me put this in
                   my safe...

     Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters
     and steps inside.

     BECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows
     into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus.

     In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus
     pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat
     bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts
     the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka.

     We see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong?

     Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out,
     he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives
     him a thumbs up.

     MESS - LATER

     Five specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and
     looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs
     of the officers.

                                BOWMAN
                   Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?

                                JONES
                   Aw, loosen up, Bowman...
                                (he looks over and
                                notices Willie)
                   Hey, Willie, I got one served
                   up for you.

     Willie shakes her head.

                                WILLIE
                   No, thanks.  I've got my
                   blood tests in three days.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's all you do is exercise.
                   You got to learn to live a little.

                                WILLIE
                   After my astronaut training physical,
                   then I'll tie one on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.

                                COBB
                   Hey what happens it he goes
                   back and finds the bottle missing?

                                DEJESUS
                   He won't...

     He holds up a plastic IV bag filled with clear liquid.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   I poured the vodka in here.

     Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink
     glasses, then knock back their vodka.  Afterwards we get
     their reactions.

     JONES:  Looks concerned.
     BOWMAN:  Shakes her head, something's wrong.
     DEJESUS:  Can't get the taste off his tongue.
     COBB:  Seems totally satisfied.
     SIXPACK:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it,
     suddenly spits the vodka out.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shit!  It's water!

                                JONES
                   Beck switched it!

                                DEJESUS
                   Can you beat that?  The sonof-
                   abitch doesn't trust us!

     Willie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out
     into the corridor.  Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot
     glass away and leaves.

                                SIXPACK
                   That little turd.  If I
                   ever get the chance I'll
                   fix his ass.

     The others put down their glasses disappointedly except
     Bowman.  She watches Sixpack.

     DORMITORY

     SIXPACK'S BUNK  He closes his privacy door and hesitates as
     if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask
     with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the
     Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull.  Suddenly WHAM!

     The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open.
     Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN.

                                BOWMAN
                   Didn't I ever tell you vodka
                   was my favorite drink?

     She holds out her glass.  Sixpack looks around the Dorm,
     it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot.

     CORRIDOR "B"

     ON WILLIE  She is jogging through the corridors.  Suddenly
     there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks
     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The
     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
     light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.

     As she passes the door she notices the light and stops.  Beck
     stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
     the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside.
     He sees her.

                                BECK
                   That was a loud one wasn't it?

                                WILLIE
                   After a month of it you'd think
                   I'd be used to it.

     She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping
     under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
     above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her
     lean body easily doing the exercises.

                                BECK
                                (watching her)
                   How's astronaut training?

                                WILLIE
                   Why?  You going to give me hard
                   time like the others?

                                BECK
                   No.  I'm just being friendly.

                                WILLIE
                                (beat)
                   Good...It's going good.

     Beck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to
     watch Willie's sexy, athletic body.

                                BECK
                   Whatever made you want to
                   do a tour down here?

                                WILLIE
                   I need electrical field
                   experience on my resume.
                   Everything helps...
                                (she watches him)
                   Why are you here?

                                BECK
                   Everybody in corporate training
                   serves a tour on the line.  Sup-
                   posed to hone leadership skills
                   or something.

                                WILLIE
                   Has it helped?

     Beck shrugs.

                                WILLIE
                   I guess there's not a lot of
                   adventure in the Control Room.

     Beck looks up and they lock eyes.

                                BECK
                   You think I should hang around
                   more with the crew?

                                WILLIE
                   Well, I always heard you don't
                   "learn" leadership, you earn it.
                                (beat)
                   How did you know they'd get
                   into the vodka?

     Beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles.

                                BECK
                   I guess I figured if I was in
                   their shoes that's what I would've
                   done.

     INT. MESS/ BLACKBOARD - MORNING

     SCREECH!  The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a
     "1" over the words "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with
     the chalk.

                                JONES
                   Puuleeeeze...

     INT. DORMITORY - SAME

     DeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large
     mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the
     mess.  He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and
     bangs on it.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine
                   amigo...

     There is no answer.  Carefully he opens the door and is
     surprised to find it empty.

     INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

     CLOSE ON Sixpack's eye.  We pull back to see it is being
     examined by Doc who frowns.

                                DOC
                   Let's see your tongue.

     Sixpack obliges as Beck enters.

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?

                                DOC
                   Pretty good imitation of
                   a hangover and I ought to know.

                                SIXPACK
                   Well, it ain't!  It feels a
                   thousand times worse.

                                DOC
                   Where?

                                SIXPACK
                   I...I dunno.  I just feel...
                   wrong.

                                DOC
                   Take off your shirt.

     Sixpack pulls off his shirt.  Doc frowns in surprise.

     WHAT HE SEES:  SIXPACK'S TORSO  There are strange black
     areas, each of them an inch in diameter.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   How long...how long have you
                   had these?

                                SIXPACK
                                (surprised, scared)
                   Shit, Doc...I didn't know I
                   had them.

     Doc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored.  It's a
     different texture.  Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and
     Sixpack screams in agony.  Doc and Beck lock eyes.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     CLOSE ON MARTIN on Beck's video monitor.  He is drinking a
     cup of coffee.

                                MARTIN
                   ...as long as you know it's
                   not in your contract.

                                BECK
                   I know that.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, suit yourself, then...its
                   your decision...
                                (he chuckles)
                   Ha ha...a little joke...suit
                   yourself...

     Beck interrupts impatiently.

                                BECK
                   How's the weather for pickup
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                                (looking at a report,
                                then up at Beck)
                   Beautiful.

     THE SWAMP - MORNING

     The crew members climb into their suits.

                                COBB
                   Bad as he is there's no way
                   we can make our quota with-
                   out his sad self out there.
                   You just can't do it.

                                DEJESUS
                                (angrily)
                   He's tanking on us...

                                WILLIE
                   No...he's really sick.  I heard him
                   last night.  The company will take
                   that into consideration...

                                JONES
                   Honey, the company don't give
                   a flying fuck about "whys," they
                   just look at the numbers and
                   the contract says if we miss our
                   quota they only got to pay us
                   half-pay for the entire month.

                                DEJESUS
                                (convinced)
                   'Cocksucker's tanking on us...

     Suddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   No, he's really sick...He won't
                   be going out today.

     The crew increases its bitching...

                                COBB
                   There goes our quota...

                                BOWMAN
                   Thirty days, right down the toilet...

     Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends
     the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit.
     DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him
     carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is
     quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck
     tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence.

                                COBB
                   Excuse me, sir...

                                BECK
                   Is this a contract violation,
                   Mr. Cobb?

                                COBB
                   No sir...I just wanted to know
                   if you needed a hand?

     Beck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie.
     She nods slightly.  Beck turns back to Cobb.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   Thanks...

     INT. THE INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and
     opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
     stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood
     are labeled with the various crew members' names.

     Sixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is
     shivering violently and scared.

                                SIXPACK
                                (he's losing it)
                   Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...

     We see a change in Doc's demeanor.  He is suddenly needed
     and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to
     the challenge.

                                DOC
                   I'm just going to take a tiny
                   piece of skin to look at under
                   the microscope...Afterwards I'll
                   give you a sedative.

     Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams.

     VIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE

     An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity.
     We see it literally spreading before our eyes.

     ON DOC

     He leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face
     for the first time since first year medical studies--and
     there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at
     Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the
     table.

     UNDERWATER

     Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the
     actions and a crispness to the voices.  People doing work
     that is moving sharply.  Pride in what they're doing.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, number 23's full.

                                BECK
                   Let's get it out of here and
                   bring in a new one.

                                JONES
                   Yes sir...

                                BOWMAN
                   Hook's on 24...

                                BECK
                   Let's have her...

     The Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift
     the container as the miners guide it to the track...

     INT. INFIRMARY/ SHACK - SAME

     Doc is at the console of his computer.  As words appear on
     the screen, obviously in response to his query...

     "...would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin..."

     Doc shakes his head disgustedly.

                                DOC
                                (to himself)
                   No kidding?  "A virus of
                   unknown origin."  Come on and
                   tell me something I don't know...
                   like what's going on...

     ON SCREEN

     More words come up.  "...no idea..."

                                DOC(cont'd)
                                (typing, angrily)
                   Then take a guess, goddamnit!

     He finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor
     flashes the word "PROCESSING".  Then an answer comes up.
     "Genetic Alteration?"  The words send a chill down Doc's
     spine.

     SWAMP ROOM - LATER

     The mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room
     after a winning game.  DeJesus climbs out of his suit and
     slaps Beck on the shoulder.

                                DEJESUS
                   Good work out there, Mr. Becky.

     Beck, obviously pleased, looks at the others.  Jones sums up
     the feelings of the entire group.

                                JONES
                   Thank you, sir.

     Beck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing
     red light over the intercom.

     INFIRMARY - LATER

     Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at
     Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad.

                                BECK
                   Dead?  This morning you said
                   he had some skin disorder.

                                DOC
                   He did.

                                BECK
                   Well, how the hell does a
                   skin rash kill you in eight
                   hours?!

     Doc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask.

                                DOC
                   Here.  Put this on.  You examine
                   him.

                                BECK
                   I'm not a doctor.

                                DOC
                   For this...you don't need to be.

     Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask.

     SICK ROOM

     As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the
     sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
     sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together.
     His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most
     dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
     flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins
     are visible.

     INFIRMARY

     Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip.  Beck
     enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet.

                                BECK
                   The mask is because you think
                   it might be...catching?

                                DOC
                   I don't know.  I've been back
                   and forth with Narragansett Naval
                   all day, consulting with the best
                   people in maritime medicine, the
                   best people in viruses...

                                BECK
                                (impatiently)
                   And?

                                DOC
                   And they didn't believe the
                   symptoms I described...

                   something in the air, food....
                                (he looks up and
                                locks eyes with Beck)
                   But he went on that ship and so
                   did Williams...
                                (beat)
                   I want to examine the crew.

                                BECK
                                (still in shock)
                   Yeah...right...

     He starts to the door and Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I've reported the death to
                   the company.

     INT. THE MESS - SAME

     The mess is quiet.  All eyes are down.  Sixpack's absence is
     noticeable.

                                JONES
                   "Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin'
                   "routine" about no physical check-
                   up 10,000 feet down...especially
                   when we're getting picked up the
                   next day!

                                COBB
                   He didn't say it was a "routine
                   check-up," he said it was a "routine
                   precaution."

                                WILLIE
                   Must be bad.  Even sick
                   Sixpack never missed a meal.

                                DEJESUS
                   It's this fucking air system....

                                COBB
                   Ain't the food or the
                   air system, he's just sick...
                   Everybody gets sick every
                   now and then.  It's all
                   part of being human!

     Bowman suddenly becomes pale.

                                BOWMAN
                   Well, I must be human because
                   I'm sure as hell sick.

     She gets up from the table and dashes for the toilet.

     EXAMINATION SEQUENCE

     CLOSE ON WHITE SKIN/(COBB)

     Pale skin, fishbelly white with white hairs, seen closely...

                   I guess I'm kinda...outta shape...

                   This skin condition...what is it?
                   Like herpes, or measles, or what?

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   It's difficult to describe.

     Doc is scrutinizing Cobb's flabby body closely.  They're
     alone in the shower room.  Stainless steel, and mirrors.  Doc
     stops and checks a place on Cobb more closely.

                                COBB
                                (watching, nervous)

                   wife wouldn't understand that at all...

     Doc peers closely, satisfies himself that it's nothing.

                                DOC
                   You seem all right.

                                COBS
                                (relieved)
                   She wouldn't understand.  She'd
                   think I was down here fucking
                   my head off.

     DARK SKIN/ PORES  Black skin, seen very close, the pores
     appearing like craters.

     We're looking at Jones' naked body...rippling muscles.

                                JONES
                                (grumbling)
                   This whole thing's unnecessary, Doc.
                   Only "skin problem" I got is
                   white people...
                                (beat, suspiciously)
                   How come you're wearing those
                   gloves?

     INT. SHOWER ROOM/ SMOOTH SKIN - LATER

     Firm, lovely breasts, smooth skin...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   This disease...do you know
                   what causes it?

     Doc turns Willie around and examines her firm naked
     buttocks.

                                DOC
                   Not yet.  You got any ideas?

                                WILLIE
                                (suddenly)
                   You don't think it was from going
                   on that ship do you?

                                DOC
                   That's a possibility.  But if
                   it was that simple why haven't
                   the symptoms begun on you?

     Doc turns away to let her dress.

                                WILLIE
                   You mean I'm okay?

                                DOC
                   You're fine.

     SHOWER ROOM/ TAN SKIN

     DeJesus' body is being examined...tan skin, wiry muscles
     seen very close.  As we move along the skin, it seems every
     moment as if the next instant will reveal a dread blemish...

                                DEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.)
                   What do you mean, "a skin problem"...
                   your skin changes?

     DeJesus, naked, with his back to us.  Doc examines him.

                                DOC
                   It blackens...becomes scaly.

                                DEJESUS
                                (joking)
                   You mean like a fish?

     DeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc.

                                DOC
                                (almost to himself)
                   Yes...like a fish...

                                DEJESUS
                                (smiles)
                   I was just joking, Doc.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Beck sits in his chair reading the TRANSOCEAN OFFICERS
     INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL.

     INSERT:  The chapter he's on says:  BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA.

     The face of Martin stares back at us.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, according to Maritime law,
                   you, as commander of the Shack
                   have the authority to dispose of
                   the body.  However, the company
                   doesn't want you to do that.

                                BECK
                   What you don't understand is that
                   my crew is in jeopardy.

                                MARTIN
                   But you don't have any proof
                   at this point to assume that
                   this disease is contagious, do
                   you?

                                BECK
                   I'm not anxious to find out, either.

                                MARTIN
                   Beck, trust me.  If the company
                   felt that you or your crew were
                   in any danger we would authorize
                   an immediate emergency pickup.
                   We could be there in a few hours.

                                BECK
                   Do it.

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Unfortunately.  We can't.

     He picks up a sheet of computer paper.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   There is a typhoon about 600
                   miles off the coast of Baja.
                   It's not coming your way but the
                   Company doesn't want to lose
                   you folks or an emergency ship
                   should it veer your way.

                                BECK
                   What're you saying?  That we're
                   not even going to be picked up
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                   It shouldn't be a long delay.

                                BECK
                   But it's a delay!  How long?
                   A day?  Two days?!

                                MARTIN
                   Twelve hours, no big deal.  We
                   should know something first
                   thing in the morning.  Don't
                   worry.

     WASHROOM - SAME

     Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of
     toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a
     toothbrush from the pocket of her robe.

                                WILLIE
                   Bo?  Doc says you're next.

     Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Bo?...You okay?

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is
     weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table
     and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick
     Room.

     SICK ROOK - SAME

     Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The
     door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim
     light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the
     body totally.  Jones smiles.

                                JONES
                                (whispers)
                   Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man...
                   How you feeling?

     There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body.

                                JONES
                   Hey, man, we made quota to-
                   day.  No thanks to you, you
                   dog, but we made it...Beck
                   helped us...We just dropped
                   Bowman off.  I hope what you've
                   got ain't catching...

     He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack
     when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly
     under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Oh, man, sorry...you go back
                   to sleep.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Jones returns to the examination room.  Bowman is now
     undressed and under the blankets on the examination table.

                                WILLIE
                   Who were you talking to?

                                JONES
                   Sixpack...

                                WILLIE
                   How is he?

                                JONES
                   Sleeping.  No sign of Doc,
                   though.  I'll check the
                   control room.  You look
                   in the shower room...

     They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head
     back to the main corridor.  As they leave WE HOLD ON the
     door to the sick room behind Bowman.

     Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain.  Carefully
     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
     throw up.

     CLOSE ON BOWMAN

     At the sink in the infirmary.  She rinses her face in the
     sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings
     her hands in front of her face.

     INSERT HER HANDS.  Huge clumps of hair have come out in her
     hands.  And then she sees her hands themselves.  Scaly.

                                BOWMAN
                   Oh, God...what's going on?

     She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room.  Slowly
     she goes to the door and enters.

     SICK ROOM

     Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.

                                BOWMAN
                                (panicked)
                   Sixpack...what's going on?

     No answer.  She pulls back the sheet and gasps.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     ON BECK AND DOC.

                                DOC
                                (panicky)
                   You have to call them back.
                   Explain that this is an emergency.

     Jones enters.

                                JONES
                   Excuse me, sir...Bowman's
                   sick.  She's downstairs in
                   the infirmary.

                                DOC
                                (concerned)
                   The infirmary?...

                                JONES
                   Yes sir, ain't that where we
                   usually go when we're sick?

                                DOC
                   We're simply concerned about
                   her...proximity to...

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Sixpack's dead.

     Jones looks from one officer to the other then grins.

                                JONES
                   Bullshit...I was just talking
                   to him.  I saw him move.

                                BECK
                   What?...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
     Infirmary with Jones.  He opens the door and freezes.

     WHAT HE SEES:  The examination table where Jones left her is
     empty.  The room deserted.

                                JONES
                                (pointing to
                                examination table)
                   I left her here.

     DOC comes up behind them, then turns.  He hears to a HISSING
     SOUND down the ring corridor.  He turns from the others and
     moves slowly toward the noise.

     SHOWER ROOM

     Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF
     WATER.

                                DOC
                   Bowman?

     There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.

                                DOC
                   Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here
                   to help you.

     The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc
     opens the shower door.

     WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and
     blood swirls down the drain.

     Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him
     greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen
     and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm,
     turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE
     SEE the black scales.

     INFIRMARY

     Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the
     examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room
     door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers
     Bowman with a sheet as

                                                      WE CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess.
     Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze.

                                BECK
                   I can't tell you much about
                   it, except that none of you
                   show any symptoms.

                                DEJESUS
                   And it killed Bo?

                                BECK
                   No...she killed herself.

     ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard.

                                JONES
                   We're getting out of here just
                   in time.

                                BECK
                   There's now a problem with the
                   weather for pickup.  There's a
                   typhoon in our sector...
                   ...We're going to be delayed
                   twelve hours...

                                DEJESUS
                   Typhoon?!

                                JONES
                   Twelve hours!

                                COBB
                   At least we get time and
                   a half.  That's in the contract.

                                JONES
                   Fuck double pay, man!  I
                   want out of here!

     Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the
     corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and
     listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks
     at Jones.

                                BECK
                                (motions for Jones
                                to come with him)
                   Jones...
                                (to the others)
                   Stay here.

     RING CORRIDOR

     Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the
     sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once
     more.  THUMP!

     Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the
     examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and
     stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes
     suddenly widen.

     WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous
     conglomeration on the the table.

                                                  SLAM CUT TO

     CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER

     ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the
     length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside.

     INT. CORRIDOR "B" - LATER

     Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus,
     Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the
     zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the
     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
     transport.

                                DEJESUS
                   C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...

                                COBB
                                (angrily)
                   I ain't, goddamnit...It's
                   Jones!..

     Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, all of you.

                                COBB
                   Mr. Beck, the contract states that
                   no body can be disposed of without
                   authorization of---

                                JONES
                   Fuck the contract, man!

     The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by
     the Lift Lock.  Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side
     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package."  Like
     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The
     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
     harder for everyone to get a handhold.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   C'mon...Lift!

     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey!...I feel something.
                   It's moving!  He's alive!

                                COBB
                   I feel it, too...Someone's trying
                   to get out.

     Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
     the zipper.

                                JONES
                   Cobb, what're you doing!

                                COBS
                   But he ain't dead!  He ain't
                   dead.

                                BECK
                   Cobb!  Stop!

     But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag.
     Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM!  a DARK
     APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a
     pressurized firehose.  It beats wildly for several second,
     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.

     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off
     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a
     dagger.

                                COBB
                   It bit me!  It bit me!

     While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage,
     Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.

     DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
     into the Lift Lock.

                                JONES
                   Push Hazy!

     The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
     occupant.  Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS
     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her
     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.

                                JONES
                   Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't
                   never gonna sleep again!

     Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them.  Beck looks
     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated
     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the
     Creature with the whirring blade.

                                BECK
                   No!

                                COBB
                   It bit me!

                                DEJESUS
                   It's Sixpack!

                                COBB
                   I'm going to kill it!

     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to
     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly
     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing
     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.

                                BECK
                   Close the Lock!  Now!

     Doc hits the lever.  The elevator doesn't move!

     RRRRRRIIIIIPPP!  A scaly leg rips out of the body bag!

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Hit it again!

     Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder.

     NNNNNNN!  The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying
     SCREAM rises from the Lock.

     CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK

     The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door,
     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Flush it!

     Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown
     out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the
     splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory
     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
     workbench.

     A second later the elevator returns empty, silent,
     bloodstained.

     Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock.  The
     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
     the Shack lights...into the darkness.

     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,
     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in
     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together
     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus
     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs
     quietly.

     SHOWERS - LATER

     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is
     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the
     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
     skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
     head against the wall of the shower stall.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk.
     After some digging which produces five month's supply of
     pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck
     picks it up.

                                BECK
                   I think we just found our
                   problem.

     MESS - LATER

     Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones,
     and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for
     a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them.

                                DEJESUS
                   Serves his ass right to get
                   it.  Motherfucker brings that
                   shit onboard.  I hope his
                   fucking ass rots in the sea and
                   is shit upon by the fish.

                                JONES
                   'Fucker could have gotten us
                   all killed.

                                COBB
                   He knew better than that.

     Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all
     coldly.

                                WILLIE
                   You guys sure weren't so holy
                   when you were shooting that
                   vodka...It could have been you.

     She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor.

     THE RUSSIAN SHIP

     WE ARE MOVING along the ship's corridor that Willie walked
     looking for Sixpack.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE
     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack
     on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's
     POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass
     as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the
     light moves out into the corridor.

                                DOC
                   Hold it!  Rewind it.

     Beck rewinds it.

     ON SCREEN  we see the scene again.  Light dancing off the
     cabinets.  As the light starts to turn--

                                DOC
                   Stop it.

     Beck pauses the tape.  We see nothing. Doc is confused.

                                DOC
                   Back it up slowly.

     Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at
     the screen.  Suddenly he sees it.

                                DOC
                   There.

     ON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now
     frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
     of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man.
     Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
     normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
     especially catches our attention.

     MESS - SAME

     ON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING

     as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
     actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece
     of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
     places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones
     watches him amazed.

                                DEJESUS
                   You know that Innsbruck
                   has 64 square miles of ski
                   slopes, man?  Think about that.
                   Sixty-four square miles.

     He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
     it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind.

                                JONES
                   How'd you do that?

                                DEJESUS
                   What?  That?...I've done this
                   one before.  You hungry?  I'm
                   hungry.

     He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in
     amazement.

                                JONES
                   Hungry?  After what we just
                   went through I may never
                   eat again.

     ON WILLIE

     She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp.  The Shack
     CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing
     below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off
     the metal grating.

     LOW ANGLE  We watch Willie from below as she jogs past.  THEN
     WE TILT DOWN to the dark, still water of the bilge.  Suddenly
     something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout in a
     stream.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions
     of the skull on the videotape, Doc enters these measurements
     as they are read off to him by Beck.  As each of the
     measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins
     to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name:
     DANAKIL MAN.

                                BECK
                   They found this?

                                DOC
                   No.  I think they isolated
                   him in genetic engineering.
                   Homo aquaticus...

                                BECK
                   Was there such a thing?

                                DOC
                   Danakil man?...one of our
                   ancestors.  Named for the
                   Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.

                                BECK
                   Not exactly a big ocean
                   country.

                                DOC
                   It was when it counted a couple
                   of million years ago when the
                   seas came in and drove us into
                   the water.  Most homo sapiens
                   didn't make it...Danakil man...
                   adapted.

     ON WILLIE

     running.  She jogs past the machine room.  Looking in, the
     machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the
     Shack.  There is something else though.  We feel something
     in there watching her.

     CONTROL ROOM

     On Doc.

                                DOC
                   Some say that's why we're
                   basically hairless, for less
                   water resistance, faster swimming
                   speeds...

                                BECK
                   But what about those scales...
                   or that leech-like thing that
                   bit Cobb?

                                DOC
                   Why stop with just one aspect
                   of marine life?  Why not incorporate
                   the best genetic components the
                   ocean has to offer?...

                                BECK
                                (pointing to screen)
                   Well, if they were perfecting an
                   aquaman, then why's there a dead
                   one onboard that Russian ship?  Why
                   isn't he out swimming around?

     Doc looks up at the image on the screen.  The huge skull
     stares back hauntingly.

                                DOC
                                (beat)
                   He obviously lacked something
                   in his environment.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     ON COBB  He sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage.
     He turns on an overhead reading light and looks again.
     Suddenly a voice startles him.

                                JONES' VOICE
                   Turned black yet?

     At first startled, Cobb recovers and answers sharply.

                                COBS
                   That ain't funny.

                                JONES
                   Relax, Cobb.  If it was
                   going to turn, it would have
                   done its trick by now.

                                COBB
                   That's easy for you to say.
                   You ain't the one that got bit.

     Jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on
     Cobb's bunk.  He picks it up and we see a photo of Cobb's
     family.

                                JONES
                   Don't tell me you're getting
                   soft on us, Cobbie?  You're
                   the fellow who always said--

     Cobb snatches the photo back from Jones and glares at him
     with the same old, hard "Cobb look."

                                COBB
                   Nothing's changed, goddamnit!

     Jones leaves, and Cobb waits till he is gone then looks back
     at his photo.  His look changes, softening.  Absently he
     scratches his bandage.

     SWAMP

     Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch.  She
     bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly.

     OVERHEAD SHOT

     WE are watching her from above.  For a moment she is quiet
     as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp.  She
     looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the
     Workbench.

     MESS - SAME

     DeJesus looking for food.  In the gloom of fluorescent
     lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a
     snack.

     He notices that the floor's wet near the sink.  He frowns
     and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly.
     He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the
     shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles,
     pails, rags...All he can see are shadows.  He looks more
     closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when

     SUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND!  DEJESUS
     JUMPS, BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE.

     JONES, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him.

                                JONES
                   Man, everybody is jumpy...
                   What are you doing?

     Not fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised
     head.

                                DEJESUS
                   Getting some food.

                                JONES
                   Under there?

     DeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the
     sink.

                                DEJESUS
                   Look.  Water.

                                JONES
                   Probably the plumbing.  You
                   gonna make me finish that puzzle
                   by myself, or what?

     DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at
     Jones.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, I'll be right there.

     He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the
     galley.  Something is missing.

                                DEJESUS
                                (to himself)
                   Mustard.  Need mustard...

     He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty.

                                DEJESUS
                                (muttering to himself)
                   Sixpack...

     He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next
     to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside.

     SUDDENLY, LIKE A SNAKE, A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES
     TO DEJESUS'S WRIST!  WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP
     THE TWISTING, WRITHING THING OFF.  PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS
     PART OF SIXPACK'S FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS
     MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE.

     DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and
     causing an avalanche of pots and pans.

                                DEJESUS
                                (in pain)
                   Ahhh!

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when
     he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy...what're you doing
                   now...cooking?

     There is no answer and Jones looks up.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   Hazy?...

     He goes to the door and looks in.  His eyes widen at the
     sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing
     hunk of muscle.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Holy shit!

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God,
                   help me!  It's getting inside
                   me, I can feel it!

     He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his
     friend.

                                JONES
                   Hazy, please...I'm going to
                   get you some help, man...just
                   don't touch me...

     Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to
     the Galley.  He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to
     the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb.

                                COBB
                   What's going on?

                                JONES
                   It's Hazy...It's got him!
                   Stay here and don't let him
                   out.  I'm going to get the Doc.

     Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door.  Cobb watches
     him go.  As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear
     banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries.

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me!  Help me!

     Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones meets Beck and Doc leaving the control room.

                                JONES
                   It's got Hazy!

                                BECK
                   What has?

                                JONES
                   One of those chunks of
                   Sixpack!  Like a big leech,
                   with those teeth!...

                                DOC
                   We've got to get him to the
                   infirmary.

                                JONES
                   What are you going to do to
                   him?

                                DOC
                   I'm going to try to remove it.

                                JONES
                   I've got Cobbie downstairs
                   watching the door.

     INT. LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Deserted.  There is no sign of Cobb and the door to the mess
     stands open.  The mess is empty.  Beck is the first one down
     the ladder followed by Jones.

                                JONES
                   Cobb?  Hazy?  Oh, shit...He's
                   gone...

     Cobb returns with a mining tool.

                                JONES
                   You let him get away!

                                COBB
                   I ain't doing nothing for that
                   thing without something to
                   defend myself.

                                JONES
                   That thing happens to be
                   my friend.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, both of you!  We've
                   got to find it.

     Beck suddenly looks around noticing something.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Where's Willie?

                                COBB
                   Oh, God, she's out there...

                                BECK
                   Jones...come with me.  Cobb,
                   you and Doc check the rooms.

     INT. THE LOWER "B" CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
     Swamp.  Overhead, water moves through the desalinization
     conduit.  Jones eyes it warily.

     SWAMP

     They enter the quiet Swamp.  The suits hang silently like
     sleeping monsters.  Beck steps into the equipment room.

     Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him.
     Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly.  He reaches the
     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
     Willie doing chin-ups.  He looks down and sees her headband
     floating in the bilgewater.

                                JONES
                   Willie...

     Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   Yeah?

     The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he
     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie
     drops from the bar laughing.

                                WILLIE
                                (grinning)
                   What on earth's the matter
                   with you?

                                JONES
                   I ought to smack your face!

     Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades.

                                WILLIE
                   What's wrong?

                                JONES
                   DeJesus...It's got him.

     THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly.  Beck pulls a portable
     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
     and attaches a portable power unit to the back.  Turning it
     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.

     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
     container transporters.  Beck notices and then looks up at
     Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
     pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.

                                BECK
                   I thought they were your friends?

                                JONES
                   Were, Doss were.

     Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
     him.

                                BECK
                   You fire that in here and
                   you'll bring the whole place
                   down.

     Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of
     the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long
     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp.
     Jones grins.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his
     office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
     and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the
     infirmary.  What he sees upsets him.

     INT. SWAMP - SAME

     Jones working the intercom.

                                JONES
                                (to intercom)
                   Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb?

     He looks back to Beck, concerned.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Beck)
                   Think it got 'em?

                                BECK
                   No, it's not going through.
                   The intercom's busted.  I thought
                   DeJesus fixed that?

                                JONES
                                (beat, realizing)
                   He did.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to
     the storage counter across the room--where the blood is
     stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the
     refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the
     cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been
     drained.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie
     corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security.
     There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only
     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he
     stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which
     says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where
     DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.

     CLOSE ON THE CABINET

     The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and
     WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire
     system has been disabled.

     Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY
     HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping
     COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns
     directly into

     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,
     poised to strike.

     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the
     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes
     in the corridor.

     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is
     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he
     has seen the devil itself.

                                COBB
                   What happened?

                                DOC
                                (absently)
                   It...almost got you.

                                COBB
                   What was it?

     Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock.

     THE MESS

     The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones
     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He
     listens.

                                COBS
                                (excitedly)
                   I saw it!  It's big!

                                BECK
                   Big?

                                JONES
                   Bigger than DeJesus?  How?

                                DOC
                   It's had a meal.

     He holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over
     Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly
     deadened him.

                                WILLIE
                   It needs blood?

                                JONES
                   Fucking great...You telling
                   me we got a fucking dracula
                   in here with us?

                                DOC
                   It would explain the suction-
                   like appendages.

                                JONES
                   Like a leech.

                                BECK
                   That's why there's a dead one
                   on the ship.  It ran out of blood.

                                JONES
                   What dead one on the ship?

     He looks from Doc to Beck.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (sharply)
                   Someone want to let the rank
                   and file in on your little
                   secret?

     Doc looks at Beck, then Jones.

                                DOC
                   The monster appears to be
                   a genetic aberration...

                                JONES
                   No fuckin' lie...

                                DOC
                   ...It has many traits of deep
                   sea marine life...regeneration,
                   scales, gills, even a period
                   of dormancy...
                                (more to Beck)
                   but the fact that it remembered
                   where the plasma was stored, or
                   where the communication wiring was,
                   may imply that it has some other
                   quality...

                                COBB
                                (panicky)
                   What?...What?

     Beck locks eyes with Doc.

                                BECK
                                (to Doc)
                   That it acquires intelligence
                   from its victims?

                                DOC
                   Intelligence may not be the right
                   word...

                                JONES
                   Fuck semantics, Doc!
                   You saying its like part
                   DeJesus, part Sixpack, part
                   Bowman?!

                                DOC
                                (tiredly)
                   I don't know.  I'm guessing.

                                COBB
                                (losing it)
                   I say we should go get in the
                   escape bubbles and get the hell
                   out of here!

                                JONES
                   And hit the surface in the
                   middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you.
                   I'll take my chance down here.

     Willie looks at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   What can we do?

                                BECK
                   Our only chance is to lure
                   it to the Swamp and flush it
                   like we did the other.

                                COBB
                   And how're we going to do that?

     Beck checks his flamethrower and looks at Jones.

                                                     TIME CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     ON BECK  He flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it.  WE
     SEE a half-pint of blood in a bag, held by Doc.  He secures
     it and hands it back to Beck.

                                DOC
                   Be careful with it.

                                BECK
                   Don't worry, I don't want to
                   give up any more.

     He looks over at Jones who watches the door.  Jones looks
     back and nods.  The coast is clear.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door to the Mess opens and Beck slips into the shadows
     of the hall.  A second later Jones follows.  In the dim
     light they begin moving toward the Lower "B" corridor to the
     Swamp.

     MESS - SAME

     Cobb, Doc and Willie alone in the Mess.  Cobb scratches his
     bandage.  Doc notices.

                                DOC
                   Still bothering you?

                                COBB
                   Itches like hell.

                                DOC
                   Take it off and let me have
                   a look.

     Cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash.

     INSERT COBB'S WOUND  Pink and healing.

                                DOC
                   Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage
                   it, though.

     He looks at Willie.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Willie, would you clean it
                   for me.  I'm going to the
                   infirmary for supplies.

     He turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there alone.

                                DOC
                   I'm the Doctor.  I have to
                   do what's best for this crew.
                                (he pulls away)
                   I need my bag.

     THE LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the
     corridor.  He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the
     ladder to the Upper Level instead.

     CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL

     a grisly sight.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag
     of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the
     darkness of the corridor.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
     the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He
     types furiously.

     COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Emergency Escape Bubbles...ready for activation..."

     DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to
     the SEND command and presses it.

     THE MESS - LATER

     Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He
     smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look
     now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized.

                                DOC
                   There, good as new.  Just
                   keep your paws off of it.
                                (to Willie)
                   Do you have the new bandage ready?

     She nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his
     arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm
     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
     shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The
     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the
     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs
     off.

                                WILLIE
                   Doc?...Doc!

     She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a
     leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist.  It's razor
     sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and
     the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with
     vacuum-like suction.

                                DOC
                   No!

     But it is too late.  Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's
     gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN!  THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM
     THE INSIDE AND INVERTS SCALY--SPREADING OVER COBB'S BODY
     LIKE A BUSHFIRE!

     CORRIDOR "B"

     CLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD

     A huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck.  A scaly
     tentacle suddenly whips across the floor.  The DEJESUS
     CREATURE!  WE SEE THE FLASH OF ITS APPENDAGES.  IT'S HEAD.
     AN EYE OPENS AND LOOKS UP.

     WHAT IT SEES  The outline of Beck lying "hurt" fifty feet
     away.

     It starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck.

     ON BECK

     A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones
     waits in the shadows.  Suddenly Beck hears something.

                                BECK
                                (whispers)
                   I hear something. Don't fire
                   until we're both in the Swamp.

     Jones moves a little farther back.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Don't let him see you.

                                JONES
                   Don't worry...

     As the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a
     wounded animal.  He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind
     him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE
     FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING!

     INT. RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She bursts out the door to the MESS and heads
     toward Corridor "B."

     DOOR TO THE SWAMP

     Beck moves through the door to the Swamp and positions
     himself by the door.  He looks back and WE SEE Jones for the
     first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire.

                                JONES
                   C'mon baby c'mon...

     ON THE SHADOW OF THE CREATURE

     It moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the
     doorway.  Carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand-like
     appendage inside the doorframe.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   Beck?  Jones!?

     ON WILLIE

     She turns the corner and freezes.  There, less than ten feet
     away is the Creature.  A tentacle whips excitedly like a
     tail!

                                WILLIE
                   Oh God...

     AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly
     closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand,
     trapping it vise-like in the door.

                                BECK
                   Run Willie!  Run!

     The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the
     heavy door severs its appendage.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them
     Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.

                                JONES
                   Well done.  Just like
                   momma makes 'em.

     Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty.  Willie and the
     creature are gone.

     ON WILLIE RUNNING

     She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner
     path toward Corridor "A".  In a full run now, every panel
     and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc
     CREATURE?---

     ON THE DEJESUS CREATURE'S SEVERED APPENDAGE

     As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump
     suddenly sprout a new appendage!  Like a starfish it grows
     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.

     ON WILLIE

     She turns down Corridor "A".  A NOISE overhead in the water
     conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
     REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS, AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK
     DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES!  He pulls her
     between him and Beck in the shadows.

                                BECK
                                (whispered)
                   Where's Cobb and Doc?

                                WILLIE
                                (recovering)
                   Cobb's cut...It was in him!
                   It got Doc...

                                JONES
                   Oh man, that's just great...

                                BECK
                   C'mon.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie.  It is empty.

                                BECK
                   Lock the door.

     Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them.
     Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments.
     Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
     tracks.  A red light blinks ominously on the console.

                                BECK
                   Shit!  He sent them all.

                                WILLIE
                   The escape bubbles?

     She and Jones stop in front of Doc's console.

                                JONES
                                (gravely)
                   Look at this.

     Beck looks at Doc's computer screen.

     ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice
     will mean that the human race will never know this awful
     mutation..."

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor signed our
                   death warrant.

     SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A
     HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING
     TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as
     suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all
     nervously exchange looks.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, at least we're safe inside
                   here.

                                JONES
                   For how long?

     Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a
     message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING.
     PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---"

     SUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN.

                                MARTIN
                   Thank goodness, you're still
                   alive!

                                JONES
                                (yells nervously
                                at the screen)
                   Hey, man, you better get
                   your ass out here right now
                   and get us.  You hear me,
                   motherfucker?  Right now!

     Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them.

                                MARTIN
                   Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every-
                   thing is under control.  Naturally,
                   when we received Dr. Warren's
                   message we were concerned but
                   would never have deserted you.

     Jones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the
     screen.

                                WILLIE
                   When are you coming for us?

                                MARTIN
                                (smiles nervously)
                   Well, that's the bad news.
                   The typhoon did turn your way.
                                (he looks at weather
                                printout)
                   Right now it is on a course--

                                JONES
                   Just answer the question, man!
                   When are you coming?!

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Hopefully in the next 48 hours.

                                BECK
                   Forty-eight hours!

                                MARTIN
                   I realize you must have gone
                   through hell--

                                JONES
                   Gone?  Man, we're still here!

                                MARTIN
                                (firmly)
                   I can't change the weather.
                   Try to get some rest.  I'll
                   keep you posted.

     He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck,
     Jones and Willie goes blank.

                                BECK
                   He's right.  Why don't you get some
                   rest.  I'll stand the first watch.

                                             TIME CUT TO

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across
     his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She
     watches Beck across the room, standing at the window.

     He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then
     as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the
     blank computer screen.

     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Request weather summaries January 14-21."  The cursor
     blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  "FILE
     CLOSED."

                                BECK
                                (to himself)
                   Martin, you asshole...

     Suddenly he hears a voice behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   They know, don't they?

                                BECK
                                (quietly)
                   Yeah...I think they're just
                   deciding what to do with us.

                                WILLIE
                   Maybe they already have.

     She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls
     up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring
     earlier.

     ON SCREEN  WE SEE:  Stock prices.

     Willie types in a series of commands.

                                BECK
                   What are you doing?

                                WILLIE
                   Seeing how my stock's doing...

     ON SCREEN:  The words TransOcean Corp.  The capsulized report
     comes up on screen:  "TransOcean Corp. took a bath on world
     markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was
     revealed to investors.  The Board of Directors...."

                                WILLIE
                                (impatiently)
                   Where?....

     She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
     words.

     THE SCREEN:  "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast
     Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead.  All bodies
     missing."  Their names follow.

     ON WILLIE  as her name comes up she shivers.

                                BECK
                   I can't believe they'd
                   just leave us.

     A voice behind them causes them to turn.

                                JONES
                   Welcome to the union, boss.
                   We're all expendable.

     He is now awake.  He sits up against the air vent.  Suddenly,
     Beck listens, the room is deathly silent.  He looks over to
     the air vent.  Jones is listening also.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The air's stopped.

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically.
     A blue light on the console blinks on and off.  It says
     "AIR."  Beck turns to the instruments.

                                BECK
                   We're on backup air.

                                WILLIE
                   How much time does that give
                   us?

                                BECK
                   Less than an hour.  It's ruptured
                   an air duct.

                                WILLIE
                   Can't we fix it?

                                JONES
                   There're twenty miles of
                   pipe in the bilge, they
                   could have tapped-in anywhere.

     SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME.
     The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED.  Jones and Beck home
     in on the tell-tale noise.

                                JONES
                                (almost to himself)
                   Cobb...Job security...

     He locks eyes with Beck.

                                BECK
                   They're drawing us out.

     He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie
     watches.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there, that's
                   what they want.

     Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower.

                                BECK
                   We don't have much choice...
                   without air, the internal
                   pressure will fall and--

                                JONES
                   Crunch...Implosion.

     Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
     tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it.  Her
     action stops both men and she catches their looks.

                                WILLIE
                   You don't think I'm sitting
                   in here, do you?

     INT. CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor.  As
     they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT
     THUNDER.  The sides of the shack tremble slightly.

                                WILLIE
                                (low)
                   The shack...

                                JONES
                   She's wondering what's
                   happening.  We're losing
                   air faster than I thought.

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Which way?

     Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A."

     INT. CORRIDOR "A"

     The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the
     flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down
     into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame-
     thrower.

     ON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big
     fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared
     shitless.

                                BECK
                   I'll go first.

     Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs
     down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the
     bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back.

                                WILLIE
                   Don't spend all day down
                   there.

                                JONES
                   Don't fuckin' worry, I
                   ain't.

     BILGE

     From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF
     ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM.
     As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light
     into the eerie underground area.

     Pipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical
     conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in
     greasy water.  They start toward the noise.

     ON WILLIE

     Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move
     from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering
     long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and
     we hear another tremor in the Shack.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself,
                                calming herself)
                   Okay, Williams...let's hear a
                   tune.
                                (beat, quietly
                                at first)
                   "Off we go...into the wild
                   blue yonder..."

     ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She
     catches her breath and starts again.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   "...flying high into the sky..."

     She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the
     wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving?

     BILGE

     ON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before
     with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with
     light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has
     been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's
     worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the
     water.

                                JONES
                   Jesus Christ...

                                BECK
                   Can you fix it?

                                JONES
                   No way...

                                BECK
                   Think!  Can we stop it?!
                   Block it up?!  Shut down
                   the line somewhere?!  Think!

                                JONES
                   I am thinking, man!  You
                   think I want to die!  I am
                   thinking!  I--

     Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his
     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK
     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage
     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before
     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a
     blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS
     and disappears.

     As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
     out sending the bilge into greater darkness.

                                JONES
                   I hit it.  But I can't see
                   it!  Can you see it?!

                                BECK
                                (standing)
                   No.

     Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
     thought.

                                JONES
                   The Swamp.  There's an over-
                   ride switch in the Swamp.

     They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the
     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones'
     arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised
     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's
     thigh.

                                JONES
                                (screams)
                   Ahhh!

     Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
     tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the
     Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
     ladder.

                                BECK
                   Hurry...Get out!

     Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
     fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then
     suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the
     ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is
     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE
     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.

     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward
     directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge
     when a voice from above distracts it.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                   Hey, you?

     The Creature looks up and sees:

     ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER
     POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN.  SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE
     FLAME INTO THE BILGE.

     BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
     him the moment of distraction he needs.  He leaps out of the
     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
     power cable from the wall.

                                BECK
                   Jones!  Get your feet out
                   of the water!

     Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck
     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's
     feet.

     IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY

     The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it
     instantly rigid.  A second later it crashes forward into the
     water.

     Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs
     out, followed by Beck.

     THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE
     LAST.  As they emerge Willie helps them.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, the Swamp!

     They start for the Swamp down Corridor "A" when an enormous
     shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink
     and the floor to open beneath Beck.  The jolt knocks him
     back into the bilge.  Only grabbing onto the pipes just
     above the water stops him from falling back in.

     JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.

                                JONES
                   Beck!

     Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt
     only widens the gap.  Beck yells to be heard over the din of
     the collapsing Shack.

                                BECK
                   Go on!

                                JONES
                   No!

                                BECK
                   That's an order!

                                JONES
                   Fuck your orders!

     He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
     his hand down into the darkness.  Beck lets go of one hand,
     then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm.  In one
     Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge.  Together
     they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit
     collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "A"
     behind them.  They have to go around the other way!

     AS THEY RUN

     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  "Five
     minutes until implosion..."

     FLASH CUTS OF:

     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING
     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING
     THREE CREW MEMBERS

     FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...

     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...

     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE
     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!
     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
     firm ground.

     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND
     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.

     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn
     into the Swamp Annex.  Willie hits the door opener.  RRRRRR
     IT DOESN'T BUDGE.  The pressure has bent the door frame.

     BECK ARRIVES

                                WILLIE
                   It's jammed!

     Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
     held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall.  He
     turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY
     BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS
     BECK AGAINST THE WIRE!  IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.

     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks
     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its
     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash
     of its razor sharp teeth.

     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the
     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a
     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his
     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh
     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a
     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage
     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the
     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.

     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where
     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
     open.

                                JONES
                   Where the hell've you been?

                                BECK
                   I got hung up!  Try this!

     Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the
     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made.  With Jones'
     help the two men force open the door and all three rush
     inside the SWAMP.  Beck closes the door behind them.

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Five minutes to
     implosion."  And we feel it happening:

     THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE
     VIBRATIONS

     THE WALLS SHAKE

     THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE.
     ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER

     JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red
     handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half
     way!  It is jammed by the pressure.

                                JONES
                   It won't go!

     Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not
     enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!

     STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!

     THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!

     THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Four minutes..."

     BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK

     He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her
     suit hangs.

                                BECK
                   The suits!  Get in them!

     Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't.

                                JONES
                   The suits!  Are you crazy!
                   How're we going to get to
                   the surface?

     Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF
     COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS.

                                BECK
                   Like this.

     He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they
     begin pulling the equipment out.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Get them in the Lock!

     Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like
     Container transporters to the lock.

     ON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her
     generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around
     the perimeter of her helmet.

     THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three
     minutes...to...implosion..."

     Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
     elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to
     arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and
     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.

     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
     Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
     to the Lock.

                                JONES
                   Your suit, Becky!

                                BECK
                   Just get in yours!

     Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his
     suit.

     Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving
     along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner
     from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.

     Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves
     along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM
     BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE
     TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.

     BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
     the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck.

                                WILLIE
                                (screams)
                   Look out!

     But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and
     sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to
     see Jones seal himself into his suit.

                                JONES/RADIO
                   I'm in.

                                BECK
                                (to the others)
                   Go!

                                WILLIE/RADIO
                   No!

     THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK

     Beck looks at the others one last time.

                                BECK
                   Go, now!  That's an order!

     Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the
     elevator sends them down without Beck.

     BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he
     swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the
     upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck
     freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head
     is the grotesque face of DeJesus!

     DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips
     tremble in agony.

                                DEJESUS
                   Kill me...Kill me!

     Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with
     the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.

     As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock
     elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it
     out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the
     Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  "One minute to
     implosion..."

     Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit.
     His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy
     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
     generator.

     BECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter
     of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature
     charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck
     out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his
     motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking
     it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the
     elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!

                                BECK
                   No!

     He hits again, still nothing!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE..."Nineteen, eighteen..."  Her
     voice begins to quiver.

     BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE
     DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND
     BECK'S LEG!

     CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time
     and NNNNNNNNNNNN!

     THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK
     OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH
     IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!

     UNDERWATER - LATER

     WHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward
     the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us.
     Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A
     moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the
     darkness after the first.

     BECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
     helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
     he moves closer to the surface.

     WILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her
     light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then
     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At
     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then
     we see it again--a glimmer of light.

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Light.  Beck, I see light!

     ON BECK

     He follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as
     they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click
     off..."125, 100, 75..."

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   Wait till you reach thirty-
                   five before you blow your suit...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Roger.

     WILLIE'S POV  Her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Ejecting.

     She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The
     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her
     hand gropes for it.

     SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES
     UPWARD.

     WHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.

     No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie
     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.

     SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE
     SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE
     SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.

     Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull
     the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE
     HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   We made it!

                                BECK
                   Where's Jones?

     Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At
     the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck
     breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach
     Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water
     and inflates his life jacket.

                                WILLIE
                   Is he okay?

     Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a
     moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint
     against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he
     and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up."

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                                (jubilant)
                   The sun!  The sun!

     Jones looks at Beck and grins.

                                JONES
                   What happened to that typhoon?

     CALM SEA - LATER

     BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search
     the horizon.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you sure you saw something?

                                JONES
                   How many times I got to tell
                   you.  I saw a ship.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, why haven't they answered
                   our flares?

                                BECK
                   We'll fire one more, that
                   leaves us one last one.

     BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
     water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you okay, Jonesy?

                                JONES
                                (weakly)
                   Tip top, Willie...tip top.

                                WILLIE
                                (testing him)
                   Who's the best power forward
                   in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                                (tired, but
                                with fight)
                   Jameson?  Who are you trying
                   to con...?

     They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.

                                BECK
                   I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!

     As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
     fading against the sky.

                                WILLIE
                   It saw us!

                                JONES
                   Answer them and quit kicking me!

                                WILLIE
                   I'm not touching you!

     WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the
     flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the
     first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.

                                WILLIE
                   No...no, no, no.

     The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.

     EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME

     A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
     speaks to someone O.S.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought you said you'd
                   combed this area?

     He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
     standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and
     smiles coolly as he lies.

                                MARTIN
                   We did....Many times.

                                CAPTAIN
                                (looks at Martin
                                then to a Lieutenant)
                   Initiate rescue.

     We hold on Martin's face as from

     THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP

     A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
     off toward the fading flare.

     OCEAN - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.
     Suddenly Willie feels another bump.

                                WILLIE
                                (panicky)
                   It hit me!  Where are they?!

                                BECK
                   I can't see them!

     Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.  Willie sees one only two
     feet away.  They are surrounded.  Suddenly Jones stare to
     taunt the sharks aggressively.

                                JONES
                   All right!  I've had enough
                   of this shit!  You want meat,
                   motherfucker?  Come on, eat
                   me, sucker, try some dark meat!

     He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop
     him.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (taunting sharks)
                   What's wrong you snout-nosed
                   bastards?  My meat too tough
                   for you?!

     Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck
     watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Willie and Beck)
                   Whoa!  Did you see those fools
                   run?  They know whose boss.

     He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
     SEE a gash across his forearm.

     UNDERWATER POV

     As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
     RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!

     SURFACE/OCEAN

     Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something
     is happening...

     WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,
     THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over
     the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave
     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!

     UNDERWATER

     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and
     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!

     THE HELICOPTER

     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its
     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR
     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.
     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!

     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water
     where

     BECK grabs the harness.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, Jones!

     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN
     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND
     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR
     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy, No!

                                JONES
                   Get out of here, Becky!

     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.
     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he
     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a
     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles
     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs
     to the surface several feet away from Beck.

     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!
     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life
     vest as the Creature starts for him.

     ON HELICOPTER

     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
     Creature bears down on Beck.

                                WINCH OPERATOR
                   Is he in the harness!

     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers
     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'
     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!

     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body
     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!

     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck
     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly
     pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue
     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!

     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the
     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the
     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean
     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.
     The winch operator pulls him in.

     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER

     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of
     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and
     shakes his hand.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Mr. Beck, I understand
                   you passed your physical with
                   flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?

                                BECK
                                (worried)
                   I don't know yet, she's still
                   in there.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Well, you'll be glad to know
                   you have a friend onboard.

     Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.

                                MARTIN
                                (excitedly)
                   Beck!  I told them you'd
                   make it.  No one back at
                   TransOcean believed me, but
                   I never gave up on you once.
                                (smiling)
                   So, how are you feeling?

     Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
     one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
     the deck.

                                BECK
                   Better...A lot better.

     Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
     with a new outfit on.  Smiles at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   I'm fine!

     Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
     approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING
     THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.
     The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.  The
     Captain notices.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought we might have some
                   wonderful seafood.  But, if there's
                   something else you'd rather have...

     Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
     the Captain and smiles.

                                WILLIE
                   How about a burger and fries?

     She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
     deck with the Captain.

     AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
     distance and WE ARE AT THE

     SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping
     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
     depths.





                                THE END

     FACE IN ON

     THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER

     Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers
     of fish and marine life...

     A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current,
     their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison.
     Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
     school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the
     shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened,
     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
     seconds before.

     WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER

     Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless
     where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten
     thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating
     echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly
     WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES...

                                JONES
                   Burritos...Enchiladas...

                                DEJESUS
                                (hispanic voice)
                   Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that
                   stuff?...

                                BOWMAN
                                (female)
                   I can't wait for fresh vegetables...

     Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?"
     "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the
     others.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, cut the chatter.  You're
                   not out of here, yet.  Who's the
                   hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on
                   container 22?

     A pause, then more voices.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                                (redneck drawl)
                   The man's asking if you're hooked
                   on 22, you dumb shit.

                                JONES' VOICE/ RADIO
                   Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello,
                   Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook,
                   over.

     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an
     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and
     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front
     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights
     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE
     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                                (woman's voice)
                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.

     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM

     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion
     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at
     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,
     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-
     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.
     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his
     way.

                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container
                   and call it a day.

     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with
     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a
     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and
     throws a console switch which activates another monitor
     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside
     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is
     moving.

     UNDERWATER

     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED
     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,
     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.

     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes
     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is
     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on
     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool
     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from
     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE
                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a
                   tit or something?  We're all
                   waiting on you, honey.

                                WILLIE
                                (under control)
                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.
                   I promise you'll be inside before
                   "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.

     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They
     like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta
     girl," etc...

     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she
     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what
     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER
     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the
     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in
     by a winch.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready
                   to winch.

     UNDERWATER MACHINERY

     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding
     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.
     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.

                                BECK/ RADIO
                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.

     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights
     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:
     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.

     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will
     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human
     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the
     building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign
     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.

     ON ONE OF THE CREW

     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his
     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the
     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA
     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.

     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical
     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick
     movement, snares it.

     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the
     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE
     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on
     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has
     noticed then continues on toward the shack.

     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)

     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,
     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an
     exaggerated accent.

                                DEJESUS
                   When it's time to relax....
                   One thing stands clear...

     INSIDE ON BECK

     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see
     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated
     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He
     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.

                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)
                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to
                   hurry through...

     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair
     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs
     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously
     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand
     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS
     OUT.

     DEJESUS' POV

     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring
     vital signs.

                                DEJESUS
                   ...beer after beer...

     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze
     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   Oh, shit...

                                JONES/ RADIO
                                (to DeJesus)
                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.

                                DEJESUS
                                (rising terror)
                   Jonesy!  I'm losing compression...
                   I'm going to blow my suit, man!
                   Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...

     INSIDE

     Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but
     there is a definite tremble in his voice.

                                BECK
                   Give me a readout, DeJesus.

                                DEJESUS(ON RADIO)
                                (gripped with panic)
                   Ahhhh!

     OUTSIDE

     The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.

                                BECK (ON RADIO)
                   DeJesus!  A readout!

                                JONES
                   He don't need a readout,
                   man, he needs help!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                                (anything but calm)
                   Stay calm!

                                BOWMAN
                   Calm!?  Where's Doc?

     INSIDE

     Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.

                                BECK
                                (trying to
                                keep control)
                   The internal monitors read
                   normal.

     ON THE MINERS, PANICKED

                                COBB
                   Where's Doc?!

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   He's not at his station.

                                DEJESUS
                                (panicked)
                   Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive
                   me of my--

                                BECK'S VOICE
                                (making a decision)
                   Get him into the Shack.

     DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  "15, 14,
     13..."  DeJesus is grabbed by his co-workers and hurried the
     last few yards to the SHACK.

     INSIDE/SHACK - SAME

     ON BECK  sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments
     and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same
     countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...

     OUTSIDE

     ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater
     elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside
     his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.

     ON BECK

     DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room.
     Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it
     again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by
     the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving!
     Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.

     INSIDE/LIFT LOCK

     WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the
     Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.

     CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then
     suddenly they flutter.  He's alive!

     THE MESS - LATER

     The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess
     features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL
     PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board
     obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"...

     A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE
     MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft
     drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he
     looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES,
     Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a
     mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she
     has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE,
     twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist.
     DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still
     shaken from his experience.

     The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the
     ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.

                                BOWMAN
                   I'm telling you, it's the suits!

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits, it's the people
                   monitoring them.  It Doc had been
                   there like he's supposed to it never
                   would've happened!

                                SIXPACK
                   And just what the fuck would he
                   have done to stop it, huh?

     Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the
     empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a
     huge belch.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   That would have been you, DeJesus...

     DeJesus keeps his head down.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   Yeah...I was standing next to a guy
                   who blew a suit once in the
                   Indian Ocean...little tiny hole
                   in the fucking toe of his suit
                   ...ocean came in and the
                   pressure crammed his whole
                   fucking body up into his helmet.
                   They just buried his helmet.

                                DEJESUS
                                (coldly)
                   I know all about implosion, man.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, I bet you do.
                                (laughs)
                   I bet you were imploding in
                   your pants.
                                (laughs then imitates
                                a hysterical DeJesus)
                   Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me!

     DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO

     BECK - SAME

     Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.

                                BECK
                   Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know
                   it's been a long month for every-
                   one, but we can't let something
                   like this tear us apart...

     Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we
     see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters.

     Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
     look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.

                                BECK
                   Shit...

     He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
     college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking
     father.  Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute
     Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
     underwater mining.

     He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC
     GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems
     shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.

     MESS

     The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold.
     All eyes go to the ceiling and walls.

                                JONES
                   Fuck the suits man...this
                   place is going to kill us first.

     Just as suddenly as it began the GROANING NOISE STOPS and in
     its place WE HEAR an intermittent RATTLE in the air system.
     Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.

                                DEJESUS
                                (listening)
                   There it is again...
                                (sitting down again)
                   Two more days.  I tell myself
                   'you can make it two more days--'

                                BOWMAN
                   What's the weather like up top?

                                WILLIE
                   Clear for pickup.

                                JONES
                   Let's hope it holds.

     Cobb looks up disgustingly.

                                COBB
                   Then what?  Huh?
                                (to everyone)
                   Then what?  You folks think
                   going up top's the answer to
                   all your problems.  Well, it ain't.

                                BOWMAN
                   Give us a break, Cobb...

                                COBB
                   A break?  You folks don't need a break,
                   you need psychiatrists.  'Know what
                   you'd be doing if you were up there,
                   right now?

                                SIXPACK
                                (a boorish leer)
                   Eating pussy and drinking brew...

                                COBB
                   Eating pussy my ass.  What about
                   lines at the bank:  What about
                   getting stuck in traffic?

                                SIXPACK
                                (grinning)
                   Wherever I can find it.

     Everyone laughs but Cobb, WE SEE he's serious.

                                COBB
                   Bullshit!  I'll tell you
                   what you'd be doing!  You'd
                   be watching news on TV
                   that's so fucking bad it
                   makes you nauseous.  So you
                   go out and get in your car
                   to get some fresh air and
                   after you've been driving for
                   five minutes you realize the
                   air's so damn dirty you don't dare
                   breath it!  That's what you've
                   got to look forward to...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR

     Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb
     ranting inside.

                                COBB'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   ...And if you're lucky
                   enough to make it back home
                   to your house that looks the
                   fucking same as everyone else's,
                   you'll find your wife's just as
                   fat as she was when you left and
                   the only reason your kids ain't
                   strung out on the drugs they were
                   using when you left is that
                   they've found some new drugs
                   which fuck 'em up even more!...
                   You people just don't appreciate
                   how good you've got down here...

     BECK hesitates at the door to the Mess, as though screwing
     up his courage, then takes a deep breath and enters as we

                                                        CUT TO

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Everyone looks up as Beck enters and the room goes quiet.
     Beck notices Doc's empty chair.

                                BECK
                   Doc eat already?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor hasn't showed yet.

     Looks are exchanged.  Sixpack smirks knowingly.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   How do you feel, DeJesus?

                                DEJESUS
                                (obviously embarrassed
                                to be singled out)
                   Okay.

                                BECK
                   Better let the Doc take a
                   look at you, after dinner.

                                SIXPACK
                   Yeah, since he was busy earlier
                   when you needed him.

     He cracks up and Beck turns on him.

                                BECK
                   Cut it, Sixpack.

     Sixpack shuts up, but Beck notices the others feel the
     seriousness of Doc's absence during the emergency.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Leave the Doc to me.  I'm
                   going to talk to him.

                                SIXPACK
                                (sarcastically, under his
                                breath to Bowman)
                   'Makes me feel better already...

     Beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about
     something else.  He clears his throat.

                                 BECK
                   I've been looking at the duty
                   roster...at the shack hours
                   outstanding...

                                 JONES
                   Uh, oh...I see where this
                   is going...

                                 BECK
                                 (ignoring Jones)
                   ...all of you owe time and I
                   thought tonight would be a good
                   time to---

                                 COBB
                                 (erupting)
                   No way, Mister Beck!  No
                   fucking way!  We just did a
                   full shift, you can't call
                   Shack duty on top of a full
                   shift.  It's a contract violation!

                                 JONES
                   Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's
                   hear it for our shop Steward!

                                 SIXPACK
                   Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck?
                   Company got to abide by the rules.

     FIVE FACES STARE AT BECK.  THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WEAKNESS.
     THIS IS A CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY.

                                BECK
                   I know all about the contract.
                   The point is you can follow the
                   goddamn contract to the letter and pull
                   your shack duty tomorrow...or you
                   can get it done tonight and call
                   tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you.

     This leaves the group momentarily speechless.  Even DeJesus
     comes out of his stupor.

                                DEJESUS
                   You giving us a day off?

     Beck nods.  Cobb eyes him suspiciously.

                                COBB
                   What about our quota?

                                BECK
                   You're only twenty-five
                   tons off quota.  Barring an
                   unforeseen problem you should
                   reach it easily on the last day.
                                (he looks at the group)
                   It's just a day off.  You don't
                   have to take it, I just thought it
                   might help.

     The others look around for agreement but Jones doesn't need
     anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind.

                                JONES
                   Count me in.

     Bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree.
     Buoyed, Beck moves ahead, businesslike...

                                BECK
                   Cobb, Jones, I want you to do
                   something about that damn rattle
                   in the air system...
                                (to Bowman and Sixpack)
                   Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...

                                SIXPACK
                                (disgustedly)
                   Shit...

                                BECK
                   Williams...get DeJesus' suit on
                   the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.
                                (to group)
                   Any other suit problems she should
                   know about?

     Sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses.

                                SIXPACK
                                (to Willie)
                   My pocket.  Check my pocket,
                   will ya, honey?

                                WILLIE
                                (annoyed)
                   Your pocket?

                                SIXPACK
                   The latch is screwed up.  Or
                   the hinge.

                                WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                   Right.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds
     himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously
     uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together.
     She smiles, friendly, at ease.

                                WILLIE
                   You did good...

                                BECK
                                (a little surprised)
                   What?

                                WILLIE
                   Today...with DeJesus.  That
                   was smart thinking to get him
                   inside...

                                BECK
                   There probably wasn't anything
                   wrong with his suit...

                                WILLIE
                   Still...you did the right thing.

     She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny,
     but honest compliment.  He savors it.

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy
     bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and
     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is
     spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we
     saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.

     Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a
     motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked,
     laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked
     screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the
     control switch and hits the START button.

     NNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track
     toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it
     says:  DEJESUS.

     DOC'S OFFICE - SAME

     Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting
     on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been
     quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.

                                DOC
                   I must have dozed off.

     Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad
     Whiskey.  He picks it up.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Snakebite medicine...Never
                   pack my bag without it.

     Beck doesn't smile.  He puts the bottle back down and Doc
     watches him in the mirror.

                                BECK
                   Are you planning on working tomorrow?

                                DOC
                   Well, I'll be on the golf course
                   in the morning.  Then, if I don't
                   have any babies to deliver--

                                BECK
                                (cutting him off)
                   We almost had an accident today.
                   DeJesus' suit...

     The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck.

                                DOC
                   You got something to say to me, son?...

     Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he
     falters.

                                BECK
                   I...I think it's important to
                   have the second officer on deck.

     Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.

                                DOC
                   I'll keep it to nine holes
                   in the morning.

     THE DORMITORY - SAME

     Small but functional.  The bunks can be closed-off with a
     privacy door.  Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
     otherwise sterile environment.

     Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
     maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which
     proclaims:  "I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET."
     DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's
     has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for;
     Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he
     is instead of somewhere else.  Inside Jones' bunk is an
     indoor basketball goal.

     Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
     sponge and pail.  Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on
     Bowman's chest.

                                SIXPACK
                   Christ...what a pair...

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   What was that?  What'd you say?

                                SIXPACK
                   I said, "What a pair" the
                   boy wonder Shack Boss and his
                   drunken doctor buddy make...
                                (innocently)
                   Why?  What did ya think I said?

     CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big
     plate on the floor with a power wrench.  Overhead a huge
     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
     system.  The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.

     Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the
     floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark
     and wet.  Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is
     much louder and sinister.

                                JONES
                   Listen to it for Christsake.

                                COBB
                   Ah, it's just old, like me.
                   You don't see the Doc opening
                   me up every time I get a new creak
                   in my joints...I say, as long as
                   it's recycling the air let
                   the next shift deal with it.
                   But, 'long as we're here...

     He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
     it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs
     down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones.  Jones
     seems in no hurry to accompany him.

                                COBB(cont'd)
                   You gonna sit there on your
                   butt or give me a hand?

     Jones reluctantly starts down after him.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Beck in his quarters.  He seems to be talking to himself but
     as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
     monitor.  On screen we see MARTIN, 30's, a slick
     bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp. whose face is
     all we see on the video monitor.

                                BECK
                   Two hundred and fifty-two
                   tons of Magnesium and 15 tons
                   of Sodium.

                                MARTIN
                                (taking notes)
                   Sounds like a good week, Beck.
                   In fact...I put your folder
                   in front of the Vice President
                   of District Operations last night...

     Beck stops.  Martin notices his concern.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   You're good executive timber,
                   Beck.  A lot of management trainees
                   wash out when they have to go under
                   for their first tour.  But you've done well.

                                BECK
                                (smiles, relieved)
                   Thank you, Martin.

                                MARTIN
                   Don't thank me, yet, but it is
                   important to know where you're
                   going and who your friends are...
                   'Know what I mean?

     He stares hard at Beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   The one thing I've learned in
                   this company is you can't have
                   enough friends.  It's the only
                   way to survive.

     CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's
     Rocky Mountain High.

     DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
     works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal
     box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS.

     SWAMP - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic
     computer and is going through the computerized
     checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of
     possible problems.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself)
                   Probably a short.

     Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical
     Short.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Good guess, Williams.

     She types in a "help" command and the computer screen
     displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
     Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Piece of cake.

     She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and
     pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With
     two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces
     the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and
     the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds
     the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes.
     The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans
     over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming
     machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
     hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.

                                COBB
                   Okay, watch this..

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound
     in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops
     directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the
     pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE
     AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED.

     THE BILGE - SAME

     Jones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's
     all it took.  Cobb starts gathering up the tools.

                                JONES
                   So that's all you do?...

                                COBB
                   Shhhh...don't tell no one.
                                (winks)
                   Job security.

     THE SWAMP - SAME

     In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket
     in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She
     pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens.
     Nothing.

                                WILLIE
                                (miffed)
                   Nothing wrong with this...

     SUDDENLY THE HIDEOUS SEA SPIDER SPRINGS OUT onto the
     workbench where it wriggles grotesquely toward Willie.  She
     backs away and it drops into the water at her feet.

     THE DORMITORY

     Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to
     Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                                (over intercom)
                   Fuck you, Sixpack!  You think
                   you're funny?  You're not funny!

     ON BECK

     He hesitates then presses the TALK button on the intercom.

                                BECK
                   This is Beck.  Is there a
                   problem, Williams?

     SWAMP

     Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her
     as Beck's words come over the P.A.  Ignoring Beck she
     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
     the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS
     skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the
     skewered sea spider out of the water.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Beck)
                   A little problem, sir...but I've
                   got a handle on it now.

                                           TIME CUT TO:

     THE MESS - LATER

     BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches
     stock prices scroll across the screen.  Every so often she
     freezes a stock and types the command:  INFO.  The screen
     immediately changes to a financial report of the company in
     question as if prepared by a broker.  In a matter of seconds
     Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company.

     Across the room from her, Willie exercises with dumbbells
     while she studies an astronaut training manual.  She looks up
     at Bowman.

                                WILLIE
                   Made your million, yet?

                                BOWMAN
                                (studying the screen)
                   Not yet.

                                WILLIE
                   How's TransOcean doing?

     This causes Bowman to turn and look at Willie.

                                BOWMAN
                   You got money in this tub?

                                WILLIE
                   I signed-up for the stock option.

     Bowman shakes her head and goes back to the computer and
     types in TransOcean Corp.

     DORMITORY

     ON COBB  He lies on his bunk under a sunlamp, but wears a
     T-shirt and long pants.  DeJesus does a jigsaw puzzle of a
     snow covered Swiss mountain scene.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, man, you know that in
                   Switzerland--and this country's
                   the size of East L.A., okay?--they
                   speak 54 different dialects?
                   Fifty-four!

                                COBB
                   Who cares?

                                DEJESUS
                   I do, man.  That's a beautiful
                   place.  When I get out of here
                   I'm going there.  Find a nice
                   little snow covered chalet, warm
                   little woman, crackling fire--

     He looks up and sees Cobb's sunbathing attire and laughs.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you
                   take off your shirt and pants,
                   man?  You should do that wearing
                   what you're going to wear at the
                   beach.

                                COBB
                                (sharply)
                   This is what I wear at the
                   beach, goddamnit.

     MESS - SAME

     COMPUTER SCREEN  The report appears on screen with a
     capsulized history of the TransOcean company, its philosophy
     and growth plans and most current financial report.  A final
     column called "insider tips" says:

                                BOWMAN
                                (reading)
                   "Major development in
                   South Indian Ocean set for
                   fall of 2010..."
                                (to Willie)
                   That sounds interesting, but they're
                   too tied to their holdings.  Remember
                   a year ago when they lost that tanker?...
                   The bottom fell out of their stock and
                   I lost a bloody fortune.  That's
                   when I decided to diversify.

     Willie looks at Bowman a moment, then keeps exercising.

                                WILLIE
                   You take your money, too
                   seriously, Bo.

                                BOWMAN
                                (sharply)
                   You're damn right I do.  Five
                   years down here and I'll pull
                   in more than 15 topside.  I'm not
                   down here for the fun, I'll tell
                   you that.

                                SIXPACK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   "Fun?"  Somebody talking fun?

     They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing
     only a robe.  With a leer he stares at Willie exercising.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                                (saccharine sweet)
                   Hey, Willie, honey...Sorry about that
                   little incident tonight...Everyone's
                   been so tight lately, I thought
                   a little humor'd loosen us all up,
                   you know?

     Willie doesn't bite, she looks hard at Sixpack.

                                WILLIE
                   Get out of here, Sixpack.

     Sixpack smirks.  He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the
     Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully.

                                SIXPACK
                                (leaving)
                   I got a date with an angel...

     CLANK, BANK, CLUNK.  A coke can tumbles noisily from the
     Coke machine.  Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes
     out of the Galley with a snack.  He stops in front of
     Bowman and the computer.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Bo...when're you going to
                   be off that thing?  I want to
                   find out tonight's NBA scores
                   and check the weather.

                                BOWMAN
                                (not taking her eyes off
                                 the screen, answers him)
                   The weather's good, I already
                   checked, but I'll be off in a minute.

                                WILLIE
                                (to Jones)
                   Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power
                   forward in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                   Jameson?  Who're you trying to
                   con?

     They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves.

     DORMITORY

     Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of
     Coke across the room to DeJesus.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off
                   tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get
                   shit-faced!

     DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of
     carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   How about you, brother Cobb?
                   Little Wild Turkey?

     Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker,
                   from way back.  Ain't that right
                   Cobbie?

     Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes.
     Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly
     ritual.

                                COBB
                   You guys are crazy.  What
                   the hell you play that stupid
                   game for?

                                DEJESUS
                                (acting drunk)
                   What game, Cobb?...I'm on
                   my way to Nirvana...

                                COBB
                   You're on your way somewhere
                   all right...the looney bin.

                                DEJESUS
                                (laughing)
                   I'm on the way to the looney
                   bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude
                   sun bathing in his clothes.

     INT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME

     CLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the
     centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position
     representing mad desire.

     Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
     photo.

                                SIXPACK
                   Oh, Darlin'...come sit on
                   my face...

     He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The
     SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead.

     Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
     against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming.
     He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
     in more pain.

     The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his
     sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to
     stare.

                                SIXPACK
                   That bitch!

     MESS

     Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He
     points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move
     up to watch.

                                SIXPACK
                                (moving into room)
                   Bitch!  Look what you did!

                                WILLIE
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   Sorry, darling...Just thought a
                   little humor would loosen us all
                   up...you know?...

     Everyone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes.
     He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward
     Willie.

                                SIXPACK
                   You think you're so funny?
                   Wait till you taste this!

     As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE
     behind him makes him freeze.

                                BECK'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   That's enough!

     Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway.

                                SIXPACK
                   Look at my foot, sir!  This
                   bitch put a goddamn sea
                   monster in my bunk!

                                BECK
                                (cold as ice)
                   How do you know it was Williams?

                                SIXPACK
                                (trapped)
                   Huh?  I...uh...uh...

                                BECK
                   All right, Sixpack, you and
                   Williams are gonna pull water
                   duty tomorrow--

                                SIXPACK AND WILLIE
                                (protesting)
                   Bullshit!  What?!  She...He...

                                BECK
                                (cutting them off)
                   At ease!  You both have a half
                   day...Anymore shit and its a full
                   one.

     CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING

     SCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in
     place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words
     "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of
     cereal and holds his head in mock misery.

                                JONES
                   Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud.
                   Turn down the music.

                                COBB
                   What music?  There ain't no
                   music.

     DeJesus enters holding his head and sits on the other side
     of Cobb.

                                DEJESUS
                   Oooooh.

     Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're
     doing.

                                COBB
                   You know it's really crazy to
                   pretend to be drunk, but it's
                   fucking insane to pretend
                   to have a hangover.

                                BOWMAN
                                (to Jones and DeJesus)
                   Your "hangovers" made you miss
                   the Sixpack Good Morning Show.
                                (imitating Sixpack)
                   "No goddamn boy is going to make
                   me go out on a down day."

                                JONES
                                (grinning)
                   Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?

                                COBB
                                (pleased)
                   Pretty good.  He sent them
                   out videotaping outcrop.

     UNDERWATER - SAME

     CLOSE ON  A whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the
     end of Willie's mechanical suit arm.  Like a drill its
     diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core
     sample.  It's a sinister hand-attachment, something Captain
     Hook would have loved.

     Above her the ROV maneuvers into position for a better view.

     INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL - SAME

     Beck is in the control station, staring at the video
     monitors--the image from the ROV.  Willie removes a slender
     instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump
     motion, CHUNK, CHUNK...activates an explosive charge.  She
     puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off.

                                BECK
                   Charge set?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Charge set.  Backing off.
                                (to the ROV)
                   C'mon Rover let's get out
                   of here.

     Like a good dog, the ROV follows her to a safe position.

     ON MONITOR  THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SPOT.  SUDDENLY THE
     GROUND SHAKES VIOLENTLY ON THE MONITOR SCREEN--A MINI
     EARTHQUAKE CHARGE.

     WILLIE RETURNS TO THE SITE OF THE CHARGE AND REINSERTS HER
     DRILL, EASILY REMOVING A TEST SAMPLE.

     Willie holds out the sample to the ROV so Beck can see
     inside.

     INT. CONTROL ROOM/ CLOSE ON BECK'S ROV MONITOR

     He stares at the image on the screen.

                                BECK
                   I need more light on that, Four.

     OUTSIDE

                                (to Sixpack)
                   More light, Sixpack...

     There is no answer.  Willie turns around.  Her helmet lamp
     eerily illuminating the darkness around her.  Sixpack is
     nowhere to be seen.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Sixpack?

     She turns in the other direction and suddenly blinding
     lights are turned on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Boo!

     Sixpack laughs.  His lights now on, he stands right behind
     her.

                                WILLIE
                   You shit....

                                BECK'S VOICE
                   What's going on, Four?  What's
                   happening?

                                WILLIE
                   We're fine, Shack.  His lights
                   malfunctioned for a minute.  How's
                   this?

     She again holds out her hand to the ROV.

     INSIDE SHACK

     Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start
     the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.

                                BECK
                   That's great.  Now let's move
                   35 degrees southwest.

     WILLIE AND SIXPACK MOVING

                                WILLIE
                                (to Sixpack)
                   You screw around like that again and--

                                SIXPACK
                   What's wrong, did you miss me?

                                WILLIE
                   Hardly.

                                SIXPACK
                   Don't worry, darlin, I'm...

     Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides.

     Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
     turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio
     goes dead.

     INSIDE ON BECK

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?!  What happened?

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is
     blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?!  Sixpack...

     Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet.
     The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers.

     BECK'S VOICE brings Willie back.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Willie?  What's going on?

                                WILLIE
                   He's gone.  I think he's
                   fallen.  I'm going down after him.

     MESS

     Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact
     gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's it Jonesy...Sweat it
                   out, man...Got to get the poison
                   out of our blood.

     Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight,
     suddenly Bowman throws open the door and sticks her head in.

                                BOWMAN
                   Sixpack is lost.

     CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

     Bowman, Jones and DeJesus are heading for the control room
     where they are joined by Cobb.

                                COBB
                   Weren't they tied?  They're
                   supposed to be tied.

     They all enter the

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is at the console with Doc in his chair.

                                JONES
                   How far away is she?

                                DOC
                   Two hundred meters.

     WILLIE'S VOICE silences them.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...nearing the
                   bottom.  Look at this...

     They all stare at the monitor.  The screen is filled with
     huge waving tubers.

                                DOC
                   My God, look at the size of
                   those tubers....

                                DEJESUS
                   Nine, ten feet high...

                                BOWMAN
                   If he had his blinkers on--

                                JONES
                   It wouldn't make any difference in
                   there...He could be two feet away and
                   on fire and she'd still not see him!

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves through the dense waving forest of
     giant tubers, parting them with her hands as she moves
     slowly.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?

     CONTROL ROOM

                                BECK
                   Why can't we pick up his signal?

                                DEJESUS
                                (a joke)
                   Maybe he got eaten?

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What would be dumb enough to
                   eat Sixpack?

     ON WILLIE

     She moves aside the last of the tubers and freezes at the
     sight in front of her.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Four to Shack...you picking
                   this up?

     INSIDE

     All eyes suddenly go to the monitor.  A huge dark maw fills
     the screen.

                                BECK
                   Affirmative...Widening picture.

     The image on the screen widens and we see the opening is a
     huge gash in the side of a sunken ship.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                                (to DOC)
                   Tighten the picture on the
                   upper righthand corner.

     CLOSE ON THE MONITOR:  The picture zooms in on the corner
     and Willie's added light suddenly brings the letter "M" into
     focus.

     Beck presses the red record button and pans the ROV slowly
     across the bulkhead of the ship.  The next letter is an "A".
     Then suddenly a Cyrillic letter appears, then others.

                                COBB
                   What the?...

                                DOC
                   Russian.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   I'm going inside.

                                BECK
                   What's your air reading?

                                WILLIE'S VOICE
                   Twenty minutes...

                                BECK
                   Twenty minutes!...Who had
                   tank duty?

                                BOWMAN
                   Who else...Sixpack.

                                JONES
                   The man is unbelievable...
                   I say, leave him in there.

                                BOWMAN
                                (dryly)
                   What about his suit?  That's
                   a million five the company's
                   got to replace.  They'll make
                   somebody go get it.

                                BECK
                                (to Willie)
                   Willie, we're giving you five
                   minutes...after that we're coming in.

     WILLIE'S POV

     Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of
     her mask.  She moves along steadily down darkened corridors.
     She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a
     cloud of sludge rises off the bottom.  The room looks empty.

                                WILLIE
                   Sixpack?...Answer me.

     She throws open another door.  It also looks empty, then
     WHAM! a grotesque ECHONODERM slams into her helmet.  Willie
     bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light
     into the room.

     WHAT SHE SEES:  The ship's infirmary.  Broken glass,
     stainless steel...the light does strange things, reflecting,
     sparkling...

                                WILLIE(ON RADIO)
                   The infirmary...

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Three minutes...

     Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time, then
     as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white
     in the corner--A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE SKELETON.  Willie doesn't
     see it.

     INT. THE CONTROL ROOM

     CLOSE ON DOC  He stares at the monitor screen.  Did he see
     something or were his eyes playing tricks?  He looks across
     the console and sees the videotape is recording.

     UNDERWATER

     ON WILLIE  She moves to the end of the hall.  It ends with
     two doors.

                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   One minute.

     Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on
     her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His
     mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the
     ship's huge safe.

                                SIXPACK
                                (laughing)
                   I'm rich, honey.  Rich!

     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG!
     BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a
     chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case
     with Beck.

                                SIXPACK
                   It's all mine if I'm on report.
                   Otherwise you gotta take me off
                   report before you look at any more...
                   Ain't that right, Cobbie?

                                COBB
                   You're on your own, Sixpack, you
                   fucked up everybody's day off...

     DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box
     and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets,
     wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who
     stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory.

                                BOWMAN
                   Personal effects...

                                WILLIE
                                (considering
                                a watch)
                   Timex...

     She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and
     tosses it to Cobb.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Here's something for you, Cobbie.

                                JONES
                                (checking a wallet)
                   Russian money...Don't look like much.

     Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the
     table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman
     in a bathing suit.  Bowman looks at it.

                                BOWMAN
                                (grinning to
                                Sixpack)
                   Yeah, I'd say you can retire
                   with all this loot.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shut up.

     Everyone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped
     object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video
     tape.  He looks at the label.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                                (reading)
                   "Debbie Does Dallas"...
                                (looks up and
                                grins)
                   Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't
                   read it...

                                DOC
                   May I see it?

     Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                   It's a log of some sort.

     Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it
     out--Papers, more cheap watches.

     ON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a
     paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he
     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off
     the table out of sight.

     Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the
     table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught
     by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor
     bottle.

                                WILLIE
                   Vodka.

                                COBB
                   What assholes, they lock booze
                   in the safe.

                                DEJESUS
                   Probably confiscated.  No
                   booze on board, same as us.

     Doc turns the bottle around in DeJesus' hand so he can read
     the label.

                                DOC
                                (eyeing the bottle)
                   Stolichnaya.

     Everyone looks at Doc.

                                COBB
                   You read Russian?

                                DOC
                   Russian, French, Italian, Spanish,
                   Greek, German, a little Hindu, some
                   Serbo Croat and a smattering of
                   Swahili...standard pre-med background...

     Cobb stares at him a second then:

                                COBB
                   Bullshit.

                                DOC
                                (grins)
                   ...and a Russian grandmother...

     Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman.

                                BECK
                   I want all this stuff impounded
                   in the supply safe.

     He lifts the bottle of Stolie out of DeJesus' hands.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...except this...it goes in my
                   safe.

     A disappointed crew watches Beck leave with the bottle.  Doc
     stops him.

                                DOC
                                (to Beck,
                                holding up the videotape)
                   You mind if I take a look at
                   this?

                                BECK
                                (leaving)
                   Be my guest.

     RING CORRIDOR - LATER

     The gloomy corridor outside the Infirmary.  It is empty,
     silent.  Suddenly the door to the Infirmary opens slightly
     and Bowman peeks out.  Seeing the corridor is empty she
     slips out with a a manila folder.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Bowman hands the envelope to DeJesus, who's grinning
     delightedly.

                                DEJESUS
                   You got 'em!

     Sixpack and Jones are there too.  Sixpack scowls.

                                SIXPACK
                   What good's the kid's med
                   records anyway!

                                DEJESUS
                   Watch and learn, amigo...

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     CLOSE ON MONITOR SCREEN

     We see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a RUSSIAN
     SHIP'S CAPTAIN talking to the camera in Russian.  The tape
     is of poor quality and water spotted.

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                                (translating)
                   Another party last night.  More
                   Vodka.  The infirmary is filled
                   as it is.  I confiscate what
                   I can, but I know the Government
                   Observers have more...

     Suddenly, the captain hears a noise off-screen and goes to
     the camera and turns it off.  The tape goes blank.

     ON DOC

     He stops the tape and presses another button on the console.
     WILLIE'S VIDEO of the huge hole in the hull of the ship
     appears on another screen.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   See that gash?  The way the
                   edges protrude inward is like
                   from a torpedo explosion.  It
                   couldn't have come from within.
                   Like an accident.

     He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and
     has also been watching the tape.  Beck looks at Doc and
     shrugs.

                                BECK
                   What do you want me to say?
                   That it all sounds mysterious?

                                DOC
                   These observers were doing something.
                   A test...I think they sank that ship
                   on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

                                BECK
                   What mistakes?
                                (he shakes his
                                head wearily)
                   Look, I think it's no big deal but
                   if you want to find out why this
                   ship sank have Maritime run a check.

     He gets up and goes to the door.  Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I did.  They have no record of
                   the wreck.
                                (beat)
                   The Marshal Goloviev is now on
                   a tour in the Baltic Sea.

     Beck stops.  This is a mystery.

     CLOSE ON COMBINATION LOCK/ BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     Fingers fiddle with the combination.  He pulls on the
     handle.  The safe doesn't budge.

                                DEJESUS
                                (whisper)
                   It's not the phone number...

     We pull back to see that DeJesus is alone in Beck's darkened
     quarters, he talks to the P.A.  Suddenly we hear BOWMAN'S
     VOICE over the intercom.

                                BOWMAN'S VOICE
                                (on intercom)
                   Okay, try the social security
                   number...

     DeJesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, give it to me...

     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN IN DORM.

                                BOWMAN
                                (reading off of Beck's
                                forms)
                   Two...twelve...ninety-six.

                                SIXPACK
                                (scoffingly)
                   You guys are so full of shit...
                   Who's going to use their
                   birthday...

                                DEJESUS VOICE
                                (over intercom)
                   BINGO!

                                SIXPACK
                                (suddenly sitting up)
                   Like I said, that bottle's mine!

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     ON Beck at the door and Doc.

                                DOC
                   I want your permission to
                   check that vodka.

     Beck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc,
     with the vodka, but he's diplomatic.

                                BECK
                   This is a mining shack, not
                   a lab, Doc.  If there's something
                   strange with the vodka it's safe
                   till we get back.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR

     ON COBB  Standing watch for DeJesus.  Suddenly the door to
     the Control room opens and Beck walks out.  Cobb grabs a
     walkie-talkie.

                                COBB
                   Beck's coming.

     BECK'S QUARTERS/ ON DEJESUS

     He hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped
     quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places.

     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY

     They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A.

     ON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR

     Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong, Cobb?

                                COBB
                                (struggling)
                   Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air
                   recirculating system, sir...

                                BECK
                   What's wrong with it?

                                COBB
                                (thinking fast)
                   ...I'd really have to show it to
                   you.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   All right...

     Cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up
     the videotape.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...Just let me put this in
                   my safe...

     Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters
     and steps inside.

     BECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows
     into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus.

     In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus
     pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat
     bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts
     the videotape right next to the bottle of Vodka.

     We see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns.

                                BECK
                   Something wrong?

     Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out,
     he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives
     him a thumbs up.

     MESS - LATER

     Five specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and
     looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs
     of the officers.

                                BOWMAN
                   Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?

                                JONES
                   Aw, loosen up, Bowman...
                                (he looks over and
                                notices Willie)
                   Hey, Willie, I got one served
                   up for you.

     Willie shakes her head.

                                WILLIE
                   No, thanks.  I've got my
                   blood tests in three days.

                                DEJESUS
                   That's all you do is exercise.
                   You got to learn to live a little.

                                WILLIE
                   After my astronaut training physical,
                   then I'll tie one on.

                                SIXPACK
                   Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.

                                COBB
                   Hey what happens it he goes
                   back and finds the bottle missing?

                                DEJESUS
                   He won't...

     He holds up a plastic IV bag filled with clear liquid.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   I poured the vodka in here.

     Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink
     glasses, then knock back their vodka.  Afterwards we get
     their reactions.

     JONES:  Looks concerned.
     BOWMAN:  Shakes her head, something's wrong.
     DEJESUS:  Can't get the taste off his tongue.
     COBB:  Seems totally satisfied.
     SIXPACK:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it,
     suddenly spits the vodka out.

                                SIXPACK
                   Shit!  It's water!

                                JONES
                   Beck switched it!

                                DEJESUS
                   Can you beat that?  The sonof-
                   abitch doesn't trust us!

     Willie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out
     into the corridor.  Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot
     glass away and leaves.

                                SIXPACK
                   That little turd.  If I
                   ever get the chance I'll
                   fix his ass.

     The others put down their glasses disappointedly except
     Bowman.  She watches Sixpack.

     DORMITORY

     SIXPACK'S BUNK  He closes his privacy door and hesitates as
     if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask
     with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the
     Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull.  Suddenly WHAM!

     The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open.
     Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN.

                                BOWMAN
                   Didn't I ever tell you vodka
                   was my favorite drink?

     She holds out her glass.  Sixpack looks around the Dorm,
     it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot.

     CORRIDOR "B"

     ON WILLIE  She is jogging through the corridors.  Suddenly
     there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks
     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The
     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
     light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.

     As she passes the door she notices the light and stops.  Beck
     stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
     the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside.
     He sees her.

                                BECK
                   That was a loud one wasn't it?

                                WILLIE
                   After a month of it you'd think
                   I'd be used to it.

     She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping
     under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
     above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her
     lean body easily doing the exercises.

                                BECK
                                (watching her)
                   How's astronaut training?

                                WILLIE
                   Why?  You going to give me hard
                   time like the others?

                                BECK
                   No.  I'm just being friendly.

                                WILLIE
                                (beat)
                   Good...It's going good.

     Beck tries to concentrate on his inventory, but continues to
     watch Willie's sexy, athletic body.

                                BECK
                   Whatever made you want to
                   do a tour down here?

                                WILLIE
                   I need electrical field
                   experience on my resume.
                   Everything helps...
                                (she watches him)
                   Why are you here?

                                BECK
                   Everybody in corporate training
                   serves a tour on the line.  Sup-
                   posed to hone leadership skills
                   or something.

                                WILLIE
                   Has it helped?

     Beck shrugs.

                                WILLIE
                   I guess there's not a lot of
                   adventure in the Control Room.

     Beck looks up and they lock eyes.

                                BECK
                   You think I should hang around
                   more with the crew?

                                WILLIE
                   Well, I always heard you don't
                   "learn" leadership, you earn it.
                                (beat)
                   How did you know they'd get
                   into the vodka?

     Beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles.

                                BECK
                   I guess I figured if I was in
                   their shoes that's what I would've
                   done.

                                WILLIE
                                (smiles)
                   Maybe you're more one of us
                   than you think...sir.

     INT. MESS/ BLACKBOARD - MORNING

     SCREECH!  The chalk shrieks across the blackboard, making a
     "1" over the words "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones looks up from his cereal at Bowman, the culprit with
     the chalk.

                                JONES
                   Puuleeeeze...

     INT. DORMITORY - SAME

     DeJesus puts on his wet suit which goes under his large
     mechanical suit and gets ready to join the others in the
     mess.  He notices Sixpack's privacy door is still closed and
     bangs on it.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine
                   amigo...

     There is no answer.  Carefully he opens the door and is
     surprised to find it empty.

     INT. INFIRMARY - SAME

     CLOSE ON Sixpack's eye.  We pull back to see it is being
     examined by Doc who frowns.

                                DOC
                   Let's see your tongue.

     Sixpack obliges as Beck enters.

                                BECK
                   What's wrong?

                   Pretty good imitation of
                   a hangover and I ought to know.

                                SIXPACK
                   Well, it ain't!  It feels a
                   thousand times worse.

                                DOC
                   Where?

                                SIXPACK
                   I...I dunno.  I just feel...
                   wrong.

                                DOC
                   Take off your shirt.

     Sixpack pulls off his shirt.  Doc frowns in surprise.

     WHAT HE SEES:  SIXPACK'S TORSO  There are strange black

                   How long...how long have you
                   had these?

                                SIXPACK
                                (surprised, scared)
                   Shit, Doc...I didn't know I
                   had them.

     Doc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored.  It's a
     different texture.  Beck watches as Doc touches a spot and
     Sixpack screams in agony.  Doc and Beck lock eyes.

     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME

     CLOSE ON MARTIN on Beck's video monitor.  He is drinking a
     cup of coffee.

                                MARTIN
                   ...as long as you know it's
                   not in your contract.

                                BECK
                   I know that.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, suit yourself, then...its
                   your decision...
                                (he chuckles)
                   Ha ha...a little joke...suit
                   yourself...

     Beck interrupts impatiently.

                                BECK
                   How's the weather for pickup
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                                (looking at a report,
                                then up at Beck)
                   Beautiful.

     THE SWAMP - MORNING

     The crew members climb into their suits.

                                COBB
                   Bad as he is there's no way
                   we can make our quota with-
                   out his sad self out there.
                   You just can't do it.

                                DEJESUS
                                (angrily)
                   He's tanking on us...

                                WILLIE
                   No...he's really sick.  I heard him
                   last night.  The company will take
                   that into consideration...

                                JONES
                   Honey, the company don't give
                   a flying fuck about "whys," they
                   just look at the numbers and
                   the contract says if we miss our
                   quota they only got to pay us
                   half-pay for the entire month.

                                DEJESUS
                                (convinced)
                   'Cocksucker's tanking on us...

     Suddenly all eyes go to the door, Beck enters.

                                BECK
                                (to DeJesus)
                   No, he's really sick...He won't
                   be going out today.

     The crew increases its bitching...

                                COBB
                   There goes our quota...

                                BOWMAN
                   Thirty days, right down the toilet...

     Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends
     the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit.
     DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him
     carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is
     quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck
     tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence.

                                COBB
                   Excuse me, sir...

                                BECK
                   Is this a contract violation,
                   Mr. Cobb?

                                COBB
                   No sir...I just wanted to know
                   if you needed a hand?

     Beck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and Willie.
     She nods slightly.  Beck turns back to Cobb.

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   Thanks...

     INT. THE INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and
     opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
     stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood
     are labeled with the various crew members' names.

     Sixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is
     shivering violently and scared.

                                SIXPACK
                                (he's losing it)
                   Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...

     We see a change in Doc's demeanor.  He is suddenly needed
     and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to
     the challenge.

                                DOC
                   I'm just going to take a tiny
                   piece of skin to look at under
                   the microscope...Afterwards I'll
                   give you a sedative.

     Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams.

     VIEW THROUGH THE MICROSCOPE

     An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity.
     We see it literally spreading before our eyes.

     ON DOC

     He leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face
     for the first time since first year medical studies--and
     there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at
     Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the
     table.

     UNDERWATER

     Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the
     actions and a crispness to the voices.  People doing work
     that is moving sharply.  Pride in what they're doing.

                                DEJESUS
                   Okay, number 23's full.

                                BECK
                   Let's get it out of here and
                   bring in a new one.

                                JONES
                   Yes sir...

                                BOWMAN
                   Hook's on 24...

                                BECK
                   Let's have her...

     The Container transporters fill with compressed air and lift
     the container as the miners guide it to the track...

     INT. INFIRMARY/ SHACK - SAME

     Doc is at the console of his computer.  As words appear on
     the screen, obviously in response to his query...

     "...would appear to indicate a virus of unknown origin..."

     Doc shakes his head disgustedly.

                                DOC
                                (to himself)
                   No kidding?  "A virus of
                   unknown origin."  Come on and
                   tell me something I don't know...
                   like what's going on...

     ON SCREEN

     More words come up.  "...no idea..."

                                DOC(cont'd)
                                (typing, angrily)
                   Then take a guess, goddamnit!

     He finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor
     flashes the word "PROCESSING".  Then an answer comes up.
     "Genetic Alteration?"  The words send a chill down Doc's
     spine.

     SWAMP ROOM - LATER

     The mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room
     after a winning game.  DeJesus climbs out of his suit and
     slaps Beck on the shoulder.

                                DEJESUS
                   Good work out there, Mr. Becky.

     Beck, obviously pleased, looks at the others.  Jones sums up
     the feelings of the entire group.

                                JONES
                   Thank you, sir.

     Beck's grin suddenly disappears at the sight of a flashing
     red light over the intercom.

     INFIRMARY - LATER

     Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at
     Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad.

                                BECK
                   Dead?  This morning you said
                   he had some skin disorder.

                                DOC
                   He did.

                                BECK
                   Well, how the hell does a
                   skin rash kill you in eight
                   hours?!

     Doc looks at Beck wearily and hands him a mask.

                                DOC
                   Here.  Put this on.  You examine
                   him.

                                BECK
                   I'm not a doctor.

                                DOC
                   For this...you don't need to be.

     Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask.

     SICK ROOM

     As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the
     sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
     sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together.
     His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most
     dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
     flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins
     are visible.

     INFIRMARY

     Doc pours some bourbon in a glass, and takes a sip.  Beck
     enters dazed from the sick room and their eyes meet.

                                BECK
                   The mask is because you think
                   it might be...catching?

                                DOC
                   I don't know.  I've been back
                   and forth with Narragansett Naval
                   all day, consulting with the best
                   people in maritime medicine, the
                   best people in viruses...

                                BECK
                                (impatiently)
                   And?

                                DOC
                   And they didn't believe the
                   symptoms I described...

                                BECK
                                (beat)
                   Why Sixpack?

                   It could be a million things,
                   something in the air, food....
                                (he looks up and
                                locks eyes with Beck)
                   But he went on that ship and so
                   did Williams...
                                (beat)
                   I want to examine the crew.

                                BECK
                                (still in shock)
                   Yeah...right...

     He starts to the door and Doc watches him.

                                DOC
                   I've reported the death to
                   the company.

     INT. THE MESS - SAME

     The mess is quiet.  All eyes are down.  Sixpack's absence is
     noticeable.

                                JONES
                   "Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin'
                   "routine" about no physical check-
                   up 10,000 feet down...especially
                   when we're getting picked up the
                   next day!

                                COBB
                   He didn't say it was a "routine
                   check-up," he said it was a "routine
                   precaution."

                                WILLIE
                   Must be bad.  Even sick
                   Sixpack never missed a meal.

                                DEJESUS
                   It's this fucking air system....

                                COBB
                   Ain't the food or the
                   air system, he's just sick...
                   Everybody gets sick every
                   now and then.  It's all
                   part of being human!

     Bowman suddenly becomes pale.

                                BOWMAN
                   Well, I must be human because
                   I'm sure as hell sick.

     She gets up from the table and dashes for the toilet.

                   This skin condition...what is it?
                   Like herpes, or measles, or what?

                                DOC'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   It's difficult to describe.

     Doc is scrutinizing Cobb's flabby body closely.  They're
     alone in the shower room.  Stainless steel, and mirrors.  Doc
     stops and checks a place on Cobb more closely.

                                COBB
                                (watching, nervous)
                   Christ, it'd be a hell of a thing
                   if I went back to the roof with
                   some kind of herpes thing.  My
                   wife wouldn't understand that at all...

     Doc peers closely, satisfies himself that it's nothing.

                                DOC
                   You seem all right.

                   my head off.

     DARK SKIN/ PORES  Black skin, seen very close, the pores
     appearing like craters.

     We're looking at Jones' naked body...rippling muscles.

     Doc turns Willie around and examines her firm naked
     buttocks.

                   That's a possibility.  But if
                   it was that simple why haven't
                   the symptoms begun on you?

     Doc turns away to let her dress.

     SHOWER ROOM/ TAN SKIN

     DeJesus' body is being examined...tan skin, wiry muscles
     seen very close.  As we move along the skin, it seems every
     moment as if the next instant will reveal a dread blemish...

                                DEJESUS' VOICE(O.S.)
                   What do you mean, "a skin problem"...
                   your skin changes?

     DeJesus, naked, with his back to us.  Doc examines him.

                                DOC
                   It blackens...becomes scaly.

                                DEJESUS
                                (joking)
                   You mean like a fish?

     DeJesus chuckles, but something about the thought stops Doc.

                                DOC
                                (almost to himself)
                   Yes...like a fish...

                                DEJESUS
                                (smiles)
                   I was just joking, Doc.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Beck sits in his chair reading the TRANSOCEAN OFFICERS
     INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL.

     INSERT:  The chapter he's on says:  BODY DISPOSAL AT SEA.

     The face of Martin stares back at us.

                                MARTIN
                   Well, according to Maritime law,
                   you, as commander of the Shack
                   have the authority to dispose of
                   the body.  However, the company
                   doesn't want you to do that.

                                BECK
                   What you don't understand is that
                   my crew is in jeopardy.

                                MARTIN
                   But you don't have any proof
                   at this point to assume that
                   this disease is contagious, do
                   you?

                                BECK
                   I'm not anxious to find out, either.

                                MARTIN
                   Beck, trust me.  If the company
                   felt that you or your crew were
                   in any danger we would authorize
                   an immediate emergency pickup.
                   We could be there in a few hours.

                                BECK
                   Do it.

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Unfortunately.  We can't.

     He picks up a sheet of computer paper.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   There is a typhoon about 600
                   miles off the coast of Baja.
                   It's not coming your way but the
                   Company doesn't want to lose
                   you folks or an emergency ship
                   should it veer your way.

                                BECK
                   What're you saying?  That we're
                   not even going to be picked up
                   tomorrow?

                                MARTIN
                   It shouldn't be a long delay.

                                BECK
                   But it's a delay!  How long?
                   A day?  Two days?!

                                MARTIN
                   Twelve hours, no big deal.  We
                   should know something first
                   thing in the morning.  Don't
                   worry.

     WASHROOM - SAME

     Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of
     toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a
     toothbrush from the pocket of her robe.

                                WILLIE
                   Bo?  Doc says you're next.

     Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Bo?...You okay?

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is
     weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table
     and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick
     Room.

     SICK ROOK - SAME

     Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The
     door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim
     light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the
     body totally.  Jones smiles.

                                JONES
                                (whispers)
                   Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man...
                   How you feeling?

     There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body.

                                JONES
                   Hey, man, we made quota to-
                   day.  No thanks to you, you
                   dog, but we made it...Beck
                   helped us...We just dropped
                   Bowman off.  I hope what you've
                   got ain't catching...

     He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack
     when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly
     under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Oh, man, sorry...you go back
                   to sleep.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Jones returns to the examination room.  Bowman is now
     undressed and under the blankets on the examination table.

                                WILLIE
                   Who were you talking to?

                                JONES
                   Sixpack...

                                WILLIE
                   How is he?

                                JONES
                   Sleeping.  No sign of Doc,
                   though.  I'll check the
                   control room.  You look
                   in the shower room...

     They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head
     back to the main corridor.  As they leave WE HOLD ON the
     door to the sick room behind Bowman.

     Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain.  Carefully
     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
     throw up.

     CLOSE ON BOWMAN

     At the sink in the infirmary.  She rinses her face in the
     sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings
     her hands in front of her face.

     INSERT HER HANDS.  Huge clumps of hair have come out in her
     hands.  And then she sees her hands themselves.  Scaly.

                                BOWMAN
                   Oh, God...what's going on?

     She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room.  Slowly
     she goes to the door and enters.

     SICK ROOM

     Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.

                                BOWMAN
                                (panicked)
                   Sixpack...what's going on?

     No answer.  She pulls back the sheet and gasps.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     ON BECK AND DOC.

                                DOC
                                (panicky)
                   You have to call them back.
                   Explain that this is an emergency.

     Jones enters.

                                JONES
                   Excuse me, sir...Bowman's
                   sick.  She's downstairs in
                   the infirmary.

                                DOC
                                (concerned)
                   The infirmary?...

                                JONES
                   Yes sir, ain't that where we
                   usually go when we're sick?

                                DOC
                   We're simply concerned about
                   her...proximity to...

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Sixpack's dead.

     Jones looks from one officer to the other then grins.

                                JONES
                   Bullshit...I was just talking
                   to him.  I saw him move.

                                BECK
                   What?...

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
     Infirmary with Jones.  He opens the door and freezes.

     WHAT HE SEES:  The examination table where Jones left her is
     empty.  The room deserted.

                                JONES
                                (pointing to
                                examination table)
                   I left her here.

     DOC comes up behind them, then turns.  He hears to a HISSING
     SOUND down the ring corridor.  He turns from the others and
     moves slowly toward the noise.

     SHOWER ROOM

     Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF
     WATER.

                                DOC
                   Bowman?

     There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.

                                DOC
                   Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here
                   to help you.

     The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc
     opens the shower door.

     WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and
     blood swirls down the drain.

     Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him
     greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen
     and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm,
     turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE
     SEE the black scales.

     INFIRMARY

     Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the
     examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room
     door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers
     Bowman with a sheet as

                                                      WE CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess.
     Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze.

                                BECK
                   I can't tell you much about
                   it, except that none of you
                   show any symptoms.

                                DEJESUS
                   And it killed Bo?

                                BECK
                   No...she killed herself.

     ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard.

                                JONES
                   We're getting out of here just
                   in time.

                                BECK
                   There's now a problem with the
                   weather for pickup.  There's a
                   typhoon in our sector...
                   ...We're going to be delayed
                   twelve hours...

                                DEJESUS
                   Typhoon?!

                                JONES
                   Twelve hours!

                                COBB
                   At least we get time and
                   a half.  That's in the contract.

                                JONES
                   Fuck double pay, man!  I
                   want out of here!

     Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the
     corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and
     listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks
     at Jones.

                                BECK
                                (motions for Jones
                                to come with him)
                   Jones...
                                (to the others)
                   Stay here.

     RING CORRIDOR

     Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the
     sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once
     more.  THUMP!

     Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the
     examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and
     stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes
     suddenly widen.

     WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous
     conglomeration on the the table.

                                                  SLAM CUT TO

     CLOSE ON HEAVY ZIPPER

     ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the
     length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside.

     INT. CORRIDOR "B" - LATER

     Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus,
     Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the
     zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the
     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
     transport.

                                DEJESUS
                   C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...

                                COBB
                                (angrily)
                   I ain't, goddamnit...It's
                   Jones!..

     Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, all of you.

                                COBB
                   Mr. Beck, the contract states that
                   no body can be disposed of without
                   authorization of---

                                JONES
                   Fuck the contract, man!

     The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by
     the Lift Lock.  Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side
     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package."  Like
     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The
     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
     harder for everyone to get a handhold.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   C'mon...Lift!

     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.

                                DEJESUS
                   Hey!...I feel something.
                   It's moving!  He's alive!

                                COBB
                   I feel it, too...Someone's trying
                   to get out.

     Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
     the zipper.

                                JONES
                   Cobb, what're you doing!

                                COBS
                   But he ain't dead!  He ain't
                   dead.

                                BECK
                   Cobb!  Stop!

     But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag.
     Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM!  a DARK
     APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a
     pressurized firehose.  It beats wildly for several second,
     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.

     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off
     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a
     dagger.

                                COBB
                   It bit me!  It bit me!

     While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage,
     Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.

     DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
     into the Lift Lock.

                                JONES
                   Push Hazy!

     The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
     occupant.  Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS
     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her
     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.

                                JONES
                   Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't
                   never gonna sleep again!

     Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them.  Beck looks
     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated
     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the
     Creature with the whirring blade.

                                BECK
                   No!

                                COBB
                   It bit me!

                                DEJESUS
                   It's Sixpack!

                                COBB
                   I'm going to kill it!

     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to
     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly
     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing
     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.

                                BECK
                   Close the Lock!  Now!

     Doc hits the lever.  The elevator doesn't move!

     RRRRRRIIIIIPPP!  A scaly leg rips out of the body bag!

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Hit it again!

     Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder.

     NNNNNNN!  The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying
     SCREAM rises from the Lock.

     CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK

     The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door,
     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Flush it!

     Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown
     out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the
     splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory
     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
     workbench.

     A second later the elevator returns empty, silent,
     bloodstained.

     Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock.  The
     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
     the Shack lights...into the darkness.

     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,
     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in
     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together
     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus
     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs
     quietly.

     SHOWERS - LATER

     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is
     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the
     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
     skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
     head against the wall of the shower stall.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk.
     After some digging which produces five month's supply of
     pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck
     picks it up.

                                BECK
                   I think we just found our
                   problem.

     MESS - LATER

     Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones,
     and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for
     a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them.

                                DEJESUS
                   Serves his ass right to get
                   it.  Motherfucker brings that
                   shit onboard.  I hope his
                   fucking ass rots in the sea and
                   is shit upon by the fish.

                                JONES
                   'Fucker could have gotten us
                   all killed.

                                COBB
                   He knew better than that.

     Willie finishes tying up her shoes and looks at them all
     coldly.

                                WILLIE
                   You guys sure weren't so holy
                   when you were shooting that
                   vodka...It could have been you.

     She gets up and walks out into the Ring corridor.

     THE RUSSIAN SHIP

     WE ARE MOVING along the ship's corridor that Willie walked
     looking for Sixpack.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE WATCHING A VIDEO SCREEN IN THE
     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack
     on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's
     POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass
     as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the
     light moves out into the corridor.

                                DOC
                   Hold it!  Rewind it.

     Beck rewinds it.

     ON SCREEN  we see the scene again.  Light dancing off the
     cabinets.  As the light starts to turn--

                                DOC
                   Stop it.

     Beck pauses the tape.  We see nothing. Doc is confused.

                                DOC
                   Back it up slowly.

     Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at
     the screen.  Suddenly he sees it.

                                DOC
                   There.

     ON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now
     frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
     of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man.
     Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
     normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
     especially catches our attention.

     MESS - SAME

     ON A BEAUTIFUL BAVARIAN SETTING

     as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
     actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece
     of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
     places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones
     watches him amazed.

                                DEJESUS
                   You know that Innsbruck
                   has 64 square miles of ski
                   slopes, man?  Think about that.
                   Sixty-four square miles.

     He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
     it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind.

                                JONES
                   How'd you do that?

                                DEJESUS
                   What?  That?...I've done this
                   one before.  You hungry?  I'm
                   hungry.

     He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in
     amazement.

                                JONES
                   Hungry?  After what we just
                   went through I may never
                   eat again.

     ON WILLIE

     She jogs down the corridors toward the Swamp.  The Shack
     CREAKS and Willie looks down through the grating passing
     below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off
     the metal grating.

     LOW ANGLE  We watch Willie from below as she jogs past.  THEN
     WE TILT DOWN to the dark, still water of the bilge.  Suddenly
     something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout in a
     stream.

     CONTROL ROOM - SAME

     Using a computer plotting program to measure the dimensions
     of the skull on the videotape, Doc enters these measurements
     as they are read off to him by Beck.  As each of the
     measurements go into the computer an image of a skull begins
     to appear on the computer screen, followed by a name:
     DANAKIL MAN.

                                BECK
                   They found this?

                                DOC
                   No.  I think they isolated
                   him in genetic engineering.
                   Homo aquaticus...

                                BECK
                   Was there such a thing?

                                DOC
                   Danakil man?...one of our
                   ancestors.  Named for the
                   Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.

                                BECK
                   Not exactly a big ocean
                   country.

                                DOC
                   It was when it counted a couple
                   of million years ago when the
                   seas came in and drove us into
                   the water.  Most homo sapiens
                   didn't make it...Danakil man...
                   adapted.

     ON WILLIE

     running.  She jogs past the machine room.  Looking in, the
     machines seem alive, pulsing, the beating heart of the
     Shack.  There is something else though.  We feel something
     in there watching her.

     CONTROL ROOM

     On Doc.

                                DOC
                   Some say that's why we're
                   basically hairless, for less
                   water resistance, faster swimming
                   speeds...

                                BECK
                   But what about those scales...
                   or that leech-like thing that
                   bit Cobb?

                                DOC
                   Why stop with just one aspect
                   of marine life?  Why not incorporate
                   the best genetic components the
                   ocean has to offer?...

                                BECK
                                (pointing to screen)
                   Well, if they were perfecting an
                   aquaman, then why's there a dead
                   one onboard that Russian ship?  Why
                   isn't he out swimming around?

     Doc looks up at the image on the screen.  The huge skull
     stares back hauntingly.

                                DOC
                                (beat)
                   He obviously lacked something
                   in his environment.

     DORMITORY - SAME

     ON COBB  He sits on his bunk and peers under his bandage.
     He turns on an overhead reading light and looks again.
     Suddenly a voice startles him.

                                JONES' VOICE
                   Turned black yet?

     At first startled, Cobb recovers and answers sharply.

                                COBS
                   That ain't funny.

                                JONES
                   Relax, Cobb.  If it was
                   going to turn, it would have
                   done its trick by now.

                                COBB
                   That's easy for you to say.
                   You ain't the one that got bit.

     Jones starts to leave when he suddenly notices something on
     Cobb's bunk.  He picks it up and we see a photo of Cobb's
     family.

                                JONES
                   Don't tell me you're getting
                   soft on us, Cobbie?  You're
                   the fellow who always said--

     Cobb snatches the photo back from Jones and glares at him
     with the same old, hard "Cobb look."

                                COBB
                   Nothing's changed, goddamnit!

     Jones leaves, and Cobb waits till he is gone then looks back
     at his photo.  His look changes, softening.  Absently he
     scratches his bandage.

     SWAMP

     Willie enters and checks her running time on her watch.  She
     bends over to catch her breath then straightens suddenly.

     OVERHEAD SHOT

     WE are watching her from above.  For a moment she is quiet
     as if listening for a noise somewhere in the Swamp.  She
     looks around slowly and her eyes come to rest on the
     Workbench.

     MESS - SAME

     DeJesus looking for food.  In the gloom of fluorescent
     lighting he opens and closes various cabinets looking for a
     snack.

     He notices that the floor's wet near the sink.  He frowns
     and hears a SMALL NOISE, like something shifting slightly.
     He moves to investigate, crouching low, peeking into the
     shadows under the sink, into a litter of cleanser bottles,
     pails, rags...All he can see are shadows.  He looks more
     closely, actually sticking his head under the sink when

     SUDDENLY SOMETHING TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER FROM BEHIND!  DEJESUS
     JUMPS, BUMPING HIS HEAD ON THE SINK AS HE WHIRLS TO SEE.

     JONES, looming over his shoulder, looking down at him.

                                JONES
                   Man, everybody is jumpy...
                   What are you doing?

     Not fully recovered from the start, DeJesus rubs his bruised
     head.

                                DEJESUS
                   Getting some food.

                                JONES
                   Under there?

     DeJesus gets to his feet, points at the water under the
     sink.

                                DEJESUS
                   Look.  Water.

                                JONES
                   Probably the plumbing.  You
                   gonna make me finish that puzzle
                   by myself, or what?

     DeJesus continues to scrutinize the water then looks back at
     Jones.

                                DEJESUS
                   No, I'll be right there.

     He looks down at his sandwich as Jones starts out of the
     galley.  Something is missing.

                                DEJESUS
                                (to himself)
                   Mustard.  Need mustard...

     He opens the refrigerator and finds the mustard jar empty.

                                DEJESUS
                                (muttering to himself)
                   Sixpack...

     He throws the jar in the trash then opens the cabinet next
     to the refrigerator for a new jar, and reaches inside.

     SUDDENLY, LIKE A SNAKE, A TWO FOOT CHUNK OF MUSCLE ATTACHES
     TO DEJESUS'S WRIST!  WITH HIS FREE HAND DEJESUS TRIES TO RIP
     THE TWISTING, WRITHING THING OFF.  PULLING AT IT HE REVEALS
     PART OF SIXPACK'S FACE--ONE EYE AND PART OF HIS
     MOUTH--UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE.

     DeJesus falls against the side cabinets screaming and
     causing an avalanche of pots and pans.

                                DEJESUS
                                (in pain)
                   Ahhh!

     INSIDE THE MESS

     Jones is now putting a piece of the puzzle into place when
     he hears THE CLATTER OF POTS AND PANS.

                                JONES
                   Hey, Hazy...what're you doing
                   now...cooking?

     There is no answer and Jones looks up.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (concerned)
                   Hazy?...

     He goes to the door and looks in.  His eyes widen at the
     sight of DeJesus staggering toward him with the squeezing
     hunk of muscle.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Holy shit!

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God,
                   help me!  It's getting inside
                   me, I can feel it!

     He keeps coming at Jones who backs away slowly from his
     friend.

                                JONES
                   Hazy, please...I'm going to
                   get you some help, man...just
                   don't touch me...

     Jones finds himself backing away until he is by the door to
     the Galley.  He closes it, rushing through into the Mess to
     the Ring corridor where he runs into Cobb.

                                COBB
                   What's going on?

                                JONES
                   It's Hazy...It's got him!
                   Stay here and don't let him
                   out.  I'm going to get the Doc.

     Jones runs out and leaves Cobb by the door.  Cobb watches
     him go.  As the noise in the Mess intensifies, we hear
     banging on the door, then DeJesus' anguished cries.

                                DEJESUS
                   Help me!  Help me!

     Cobb backs slowly down the corridor toward the dorm.

     UPPER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones meets Beck and Doc leaving the control room.

                                JONES
                   It's got Hazy!

                                BECK
                   What has?

                                JONES
                   One of those chunks of
                   Sixpack!  Like a big leech,
                   with those teeth!...

                                DOC
                   We've got to get him to the
                   infirmary.

                                JONES
                   What are you going to do to
                   him?

                                DOC
                   I'm going to try to remove it.

                                JONES
                   I've got Cobbie downstairs
                   watching the door.

     INT. LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Deserted.  There is no sign of Cobb and the door to the mess
     stands open.  The mess is empty.  Beck is the first one down
     the ladder followed by Jones.

                                JONES
                   Cobb?  Hazy?  Oh, shit...He's
                   gone...

     Cobb returns with a mining tool.

                                JONES
                   You let him get away!

                                COBB
                   I ain't doing nothing for that
                   thing without something to
                   defend myself.

                                JONES
                   That thing happens to be
                   my friend.

                                BECK
                   Shut up, both of you!  We've
                   got to find it.

     Beck suddenly looks around noticing something.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Where's Willie?

                                COBB
                   Oh, God, she's out there...

                                BECK
                   Jones...come with me.  Cobb,
                   you and Doc check the rooms.

     INT. THE LOWER "B" CORRIDOR - SAME

     Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
     Swamp.  Overhead, water moves through the desalinization
     conduit.  Jones eyes it warily.

     SWAMP

     They enter the quiet Swamp.  The suits hang silently like
     sleeping monsters.  Beck steps into the equipment room.

     Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him.
     Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly.  He reaches the
     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
     Willie doing chin-ups.  He looks down and sees her headband
     floating in the bilgewater.

                                JONES
                   Willie...

     Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   Yeah?

     The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he
     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie
     drops from the bar laughing.

                                WILLIE
                                (grinning)
                   What on earth's the matter
                   with you?

                                JONES
                   I ought to smack your face!

     Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades.

                                WILLIE
                   What's wrong?

                                JONES
                   DeJesus...It's got him.

     THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly.  Beck pulls a portable
     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
     and attaches a portable power unit to the back.  Turning it
     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.

     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
     container transporters.  Beck notices and then looks up at
     Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
     pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.

                                BECK
                   I thought they were your friends?

                                JONES
                   Were, Doss were.

     Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
     him.

                                BECK
                   You fire that in here and
                   you'll bring the whole place
                   down.

     Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of
     the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long
     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp.
     Jones grins.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his
     office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
     and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the
     infirmary.  What he sees upsets him.

     INT. SWAMP - SAME

     Jones working the intercom.

                                JONES
                                (to intercom)
                   Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb?

     He looks back to Beck, concerned.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Beck)
                   Think it got 'em?

                                BECK
                   No, it's not going through.
                   The intercom's busted.  I thought
                   DeJesus fixed that?

                                JONES
                                (beat, realizing)
                   He did.

     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to
     the storage counter across the room--where the blood is
     stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the
     refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the
     cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been
     drained.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie
     corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security.
     There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only
     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he
     stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which
     says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where
     DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.

     CLOSE ON THE CABINET

     The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and
     WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire
     system has been disabled.

     Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY
     HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping
     COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns
     directly into

     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,
     poised to strike.

     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the
     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes
     in the corridor.

     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is
     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he
     has seen the devil itself.

                                COBB
                   What happened?

                                DOC
                                (absently)
                   It...almost got you.

                                COBB
                   What was it?

     Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock.

     THE MESS

     The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones
     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He
     listens.

                                COBS
                                (excitedly)
                   I saw it!  It's big!

                                BECK
                   Big?

                                JONES
                   Bigger than DeJesus?  How?

                                DOC
                   It's had a meal.

     He holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over
     Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly
     deadened him.

                                WILLIE
                   It needs blood?

                                JONES
                   Fucking great...You telling
                   me we got a fucking dracula
                   in here with us?

                                DOC
                   It would explain the suction-
                   like appendages.

                                JONES
                   Like a leech.

                                BECK
                   That's why there's a dead one
                   on the ship.  It ran out of blood.

                                JONES
                   What dead one on the ship?

     He looks from Doc to Beck.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (sharply)
                   Someone want to let the rank
                   and file in on your little
                   secret?

     Doc looks at Beck, then Jones.

                                DOC
                   The monster appears to be
                   a genetic aberration...

                                JONES
                   No fuckin' lie...

                                DOC
                   ...It has many traits of deep
                   sea marine life...regeneration,
                   scales, gills, even a period
                   of dormancy...
                                (more to Beck)
                   but the fact that it remembered
                   where the plasma was stored, or
                   where the communication wiring was,
                   may imply that it has some other
                   quality...

                                COBB
                                (panicky)
                   What?...What?

     Beck locks eyes with Doc.

                                BECK
                                (to Doc)
                   That it acquires intelligence
                   from its victims?

                                DOC
                   Intelligence may not be the right
                   word...

                                JONES
                   Fuck semantics, Doc!
                   You saying its like part
                   DeJesus, part Sixpack, part
                   Bowman?!

                                DOC
                                (tiredly)
                   I don't know.  I'm guessing.

                                COBB
                                (losing it)
                   I say we should go get in the
                   escape bubbles and get the hell
                   out of here!

                                JONES
                   And hit the surface in the
                   middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you.
                   I'll take my chance down here.

     Willie looks at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   What can we do?

                                BECK
                   Our only chance is to lure
                   it to the Swamp and flush it
                   like we did the other.

                                COBB
                   And how're we going to do that?

     Beck checks his flamethrower and looks at Jones.

                                                     TIME CUT TO

     THE MESS - LATER

     ON BECK  He flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it.  WE
     SEE a half-pint of blood in a bag, held by Doc.  He secures
     it and hands it back to Beck.

                                DOC
                   Be careful with it.

                                BECK
                   Don't worry, I don't want to
                   give up any more.

     He looks over at Jones who watches the door.  Jones looks
     back and nods.  The coast is clear.

     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door to the Mess opens and Beck slips into the shadows
     of the hall.  A second later Jones follows.  In the dim
     light they begin moving toward the Lower "B" corridor to the
     Swamp.

     MESS - SAME

     Cobb, Doc and Willie alone in the Mess.  Cobb scratches his
     bandage.  Doc notices.

                                DOC
                   Still bothering you?

                                COBB
                   Itches like hell.

                                DOC
                   Take it off and let me have
                   a look.

     Cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash.

     INSERT COBB'S WOUND  Pink and healing.

                                DOC
                   Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage
                   it, though.

     He looks at Willie.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Willie, would you clean it
                   for me.  I'm going to the
                   infirmary for supplies.

     He turns and Willie stops him with a firm grip.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there alone.

                                DOC
                   I'm the Doctor.  I have to
                   do what's best for this crew.
                                (he pulls away)
                   I need my bag.

     THE LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     The door opens and carefully Doc steps out into the
     corridor.  He looks toward the Infirmary then starts up the
     ladder to the Upper Level instead.

     CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL

     a grisly sight.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag
     of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the
     darkness of the corridor.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
     the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He
     types furiously.

     COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Emergency Escape Bubbles...ready for activation..."

     DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to
     the SEND command and presses it.

     THE MESS - LATER

     Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He
     smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look
     now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized.

                                DOC
                   There, good as new.  Just
                   keep your paws off of it.
                                (to Willie)
                   Do you have the new bandage ready?

     She nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his
     arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm
     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
     shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The
     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the
     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs
     off.

                                WILLIE
                   Doc?...Doc!

     She steps back and Doc moves into her place as suddenly a
     leech-mouthed tentacle erupts from Cobb's waist.  It's razor
     sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and
     the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with
     vacuum-like suction.

                                DOC
                   No!

     But it is too late.  Willie falls back screaming as Cobb's
     gash RRRRRRRIPS OPEN!  THE FLESH OPENING GROTESQUELY FROM
     THE INSIDE AND INVERTS SCALY--SPREADING OVER COBB'S BODY
     LIKE A BUSHFIRE!

     CORRIDOR "B"

     CLOSE ON THE POOL OF BLOOD

     A huge shadow falls over the pool left by Beck.  A scaly
     tentacle suddenly whips across the floor.  The DEJESUS
     CREATURE!  WE SEE THE FLASH OF ITS APPENDAGES.  IT'S HEAD.
     AN EYE OPENS AND LOOKS UP.

     WHAT IT SEES  The outline of Beck lying "hurt" fifty feet
     away.

     It starts down the corridor toward it's prey--Beck.

     ON BECK

     A little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, Jones
     waits in the shadows.  Suddenly Beck hears something.

                                BECK
                                (whispers)
                   I hear something. Don't fire
                   until we're both in the Swamp.

     Jones moves a little farther back.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Don't let him see you.

                                JONES
                   Don't worry...

     As the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a
     wounded animal.  He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind
     him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE
     FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING!

     INT. RING CORRIDOR - SAME

     ON WILLIE  She bursts out the door to the MESS and heads
     toward Corridor "B."

     DOOR TO THE SWAMP

     Beck moves through the door to the Swamp and positions
     himself by the door.  He looks back and WE SEE Jones for the
     first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire.

                                JONES
                   C'mon baby c'mon...

     ON THE SHADOW OF THE CREATURE

     It moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the
     doorway.  Carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand-like
     appendage inside the doorframe.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
                   Beck?  Jones!?

     ON WILLIE

     She turns the corner and freezes.  There, less than ten feet
     away is the Creature.  A tentacle whips excitedly like a
     tail!

                                WILLIE
                   Oh God...

     AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly
     closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand,
     trapping it vise-like in the door.

                                BECK
                   Run Willie!  Run!

     The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the
     heavy door severs its appendage.

     ON BECK AND JONES

     As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them
     Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.

                                JONES
                   Well done.  Just like
                   momma makes 'em.

     Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty.  Willie and the
     creature are gone.

     ON WILLIE RUNNING

     She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner
     path toward Corridor "A".  In a full run now, every panel
     and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc
     CREATURE?---

     ON THE DEJESUS CREATURE'S SEVERED APPENDAGE

     As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump
     suddenly sprout a new appendage!  Like a starfish it grows
     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.

     ON WILLIE

     She turns down Corridor "A".  A NOISE overhead in the water
     conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
     REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS, AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK
     DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES!  He pulls her
     between him and Beck in the shadows.

                                BECK
                                (whispered)
                   Where's Cobb and Doc?

                                WILLIE
                                (recovering)
                   Cobb's cut...It was in him!
                   It got Doc...

                                JONES
                   Oh man, that's just great...

                                BECK
                   C'mon.

     CONTROL ROOM

     Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie.  It is empty.

                                BECK
                   Lock the door.

     Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them.
     Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments.
     Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
     tracks.  A red light blinks ominously on the console.

                                BECK
                   Shit!  He sent them all.

                                WILLIE
                   The escape bubbles?

     She and Jones stop in front of Doc's console.

                                JONES
                                (gravely)
                   Look at this.

     Beck looks at Doc's computer screen.

     ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice
     will mean that the human race will never know this awful
     mutation..."

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The good doctor signed our
                   death warrant.

     SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A
     HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING
     TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as
     suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all
     nervously exchange looks.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, at least we're safe inside
                   here.

                                JONES
                   For how long?

     Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a
     message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING.
     PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---"

     SUDDENLY MARTIN'S FACE APPEARS ON THE VIDEO SCREEN.

                                MARTIN
                   Thank goodness, you're still
                   alive!

                                JONES
                                (yells nervously
                                at the screen)
                   Hey, man, you better get
                   your ass out here right now
                   and get us.  You hear me,
                   motherfucker?  Right now!

     Martin smiles calmly back at the three of them.

                                MARTIN
                   Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every-
                   thing is under control.  Naturally,
                   when we received Dr. Warren's
                   message we were concerned but
                   would never have deserted you.

     Jones lets out a breath.  Willie stares straight at the
     screen.

                                WILLIE
                   When are you coming for us?

                                MARTIN
                                (smiles nervously)
                   Well, that's the bad news.
                   The typhoon did turn your way.
                                (he looks at weather
                                printout)
                   Right now it is on a course--

                                JONES
                   Just answer the question, man!
                   When are you coming?!

                                MARTIN
                                (beat)
                   Hopefully in the next 48 hours.

                                BECK
                   Forty-eight hours!

                                MARTIN
                   I realize you must have gone
                   through hell--

                                JONES
                   Gone?  Man, we're still here!

                                MARTIN
                                (firmly)
                   I can't change the weather.
                   Try to get some rest.  I'll
                   keep you posted.

     He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck,
     Jones and Willie goes blank.

                                BECK
                   He's right.  Why don't you get some
                   rest.  I'll stand the first watch.

                                             TIME CUT TO

     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across
     his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She
     watches Beck across the room, standing at the window.

     He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then
     as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the
     blank computer screen.

     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

     "Request weather summaries January 14-21."  The cursor
     blinks back ominously then races across the screen.  "FILE
     CLOSED."

                                BECK
                                (to himself)
                   Martin, you asshole...

     Suddenly he hears a voice behind him.

                                WILLIE
                   They know, don't they?

                                BECK
                                (quietly)
                   Yeah...I think they're just
                   deciding what to do with us.

                                WILLIE
                   Maybe they already have.

     She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls
     up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring
     earlier.

     ON SCREEN  WE SEE:  Stock prices.

     Willie types in a series of commands.

                                BECK
                   What are you doing?

                                WILLIE
                   Seeing how my stock's doing...

     ON SCREEN:  The words TransOcean Corp.  The capsulized report
     comes up on screen:  "TransOcean Corp. took a bath on world
     markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was
     revealed to investors.  The Board of Directors...."

                                WILLIE
                                (impatiently)
                   Where?....

     She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
     words.

     THE SCREEN:  "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast
     Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead.  All bodies
     missing."  Their names follow.

     ON WILLIE  as her name comes up she shivers.

                                BECK
                   I can't believe they'd
                   just leave us.

     A voice behind them causes them to turn.

                                JONES
                   Welcome to the union, boss.
                   We're all expendable.

     He is now awake.  He sits up against the air vent.  Suddenly,
     Beck listens, the room is deathly silent.  He looks over to
     the air vent.  Jones is listening also.

                                WILLIE
                   What is it?

                                JONES
                   The air's stopped.

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically.
     A blue light on the console blinks on and off.  It says
     "AIR."  Beck turns to the instruments.

                                BECK
                   We're on backup air.

                                WILLIE
                   How much time does that give
                   us?

                                BECK
                   Less than an hour.  It's ruptured
                   an air duct.

                                WILLIE
                   Can't we fix it?

                                JONES
                   There're twenty miles of
                   pipe in the bilge, they
                   could have tapped-in anywhere.

     SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME.
     The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED.  Jones and Beck home
     in on the tell-tale noise.

                                JONES
                                (almost to himself)
                   Cobb...Job security...

     He locks eyes with Beck.

                                BECK
                   They're drawing us out.

     He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie
     watches.

                                WILLIE
                   You can't go out there, that's
                   what they want.

     Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower.

                                BECK
                   We don't have much choice...
                   without air, the internal
                   pressure will fall and--

                                JONES
                   Crunch...Implosion.

     Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
     tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it.  Her
     action stops both men and she catches their looks.

                                WILLIE
                   You don't think I'm sitting
                   in here, do you?

     INT. CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor.  As
     they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT
     THUNDER.  The sides of the shack tremble slightly.

                                WILLIE
                                (low)
                   The shack...

                                JONES
                   She's wondering what's
                   happening.  We're losing
                   air faster than I thought.

                                BECK
                                (to Jones)
                   Which way?

     Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A."

     INT. CORRIDOR "A"

     The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the
     flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down
     into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame-
     thrower.

     ON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big
     fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared
     shitless.

                                BECK
                   I'll go first.

     Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs
     down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the
     bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back.

                                WILLIE
                   Don't spend all day down
                   there.

                                JONES
                   Don't fuckin' worry, I
                   ain't.

     BILGE

     From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF
     ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM.
     As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light
     into the eerie underground area.

     Pipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical
     conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in
     greasy water.  They start toward the noise.

     ON WILLIE

     Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move
     from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering
     long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and
     we hear another tremor in the Shack.

                                WILLIE
                                (to herself,
                                calming herself)
                   Okay, Williams...let's hear a
                   tune.
                                (beat, quietly
                                at first)
                   "Off we go...into the wild
                   blue yonder..."

     ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She
     catches her breath and starts again.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   "...flying high into the sky..."

     She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the
     wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving?

     BILGE

     ON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before
     with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with
     light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has
     been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's
     worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the
     water.

                                JONES
                   Jesus Christ...

                                BECK
                   Can you fix it?

                                JONES
                   No way...

                                BECK
                   Think!  Can we stop it?!
                   Block it up?!  Shut down
                   the line somewhere?!  Think!

                                JONES
                   I am thinking, man!  You
                   think I want to die!  I am
                   thinking!  I--

     Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his
     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK
     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage
     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before
     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a
     blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS
     and disappears.

     As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
     out sending the bilge into greater darkness.

                                JONES
                   I hit it.  But I can't see
                   it!  Can you see it?!

                                BECK
                                (standing)
                   No.

     Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
     thought.

                                JONES
                   The Swamp.  There's an over-
                   ride switch in the Swamp.

     They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the
     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones'
     arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised
     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's
     thigh.

                                JONES
                                (screams)
                   Ahhh!

     Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
     tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the
     Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
     ladder.

                                BECK
                   Hurry...Get out!

     Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
     fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then
     suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the
     ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is
     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE
     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.

     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward
     directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge
     when a voice from above distracts it.

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
                   Hey, you?

     The Creature looks up and sees:

     ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER
     POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN.  SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE
     FLAME INTO THE BILGE.

     BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
     him the moment of distraction he needs.  He leaps out of the
     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
     power cable from the wall.

                                BECK
                   Jones!  Get your feet out
                   of the water!

     Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck
     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's
     feet.

     IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY

     The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it
     instantly rigid.  A second later it crashes forward into the
     water.

     Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs
     out, followed by Beck.

     THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE
     LAST.  As they emerge Willie helps them.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, the Swamp!

     They start for the Swamp down Corridor "A" when an enormous
     shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink
     and the floor to open beneath Beck.  The jolt knocks him
     back into the bilge.  Only grabbing onto the pipes just
     above the water stops him from falling back in.

     JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.

                                JONES
                   Beck!

     Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt
     only widens the gap.  Beck yells to be heard over the din of
     the collapsing Shack.

                                BECK
                   Go on!

                                JONES
                   No!

                                BECK
                   That's an order!

                                JONES
                   Fuck your orders!

     He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
     his hand down into the darkness.  Beck lets go of one hand,
     then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm.  In one
     Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge.  Together
     they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit
     collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "A"
     behind them.  They have to go around the other way!

     AS THEY RUN

     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  "Five
     minutes until implosion..."

     FLASH CUTS OF:

     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING
     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING
     THREE CREW MEMBERS

     FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...

     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...

     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE
     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!
     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
     firm ground.

     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND
     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.

     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn
     into the Swamp Annex.  Willie hits the door opener.  RRRRRR
     IT DOESN'T BUDGE.  The pressure has bent the door frame.

     BECK ARRIVES

                                WILLIE
                   It's jammed!

     Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
     held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall.  He
     turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY
     BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS
     BECK AGAINST THE WIRE!  IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.

     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks
     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its
     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash
     of its razor sharp teeth.

     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the
     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a
     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his
     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh
     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a
     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage
     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the
     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.

     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where
     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
     open.

                                JONES
                   Where the hell've you been?

                                BECK
                   I got hung up!  Try this!

     Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the
     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made.  With Jones'
     help the two men force open the door and all three rush
     inside the SWAMP.  Beck closes the door behind them.

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Five minutes to
     implosion."  And we feel it happening:

     THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE
     VIBRATIONS

     THE WALLS SHAKE

     THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE.
     ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER

     JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red
     handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half
     way!  It is jammed by the pressure.

                                JONES
                   It won't go!

     Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not
     enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!

     STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!

     THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!

     THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Four minutes..."

     BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK

     He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her
     suit hangs.

                                BECK
                   The suits!  Get in them!

     Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't.

                                JONES
                   The suits!  Are you crazy!
                   How're we going to get to
                   the surface?

     Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF
     COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS.

                                BECK
                   Like this.

     He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they
     begin pulling the equipment out.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Get them in the Lock!

     Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like
     Container transporters to the lock.

     ON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her
     generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around
     the perimeter of her helmet.

     THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three
     minutes...to...implosion..."

     Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
     elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to
     arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and
     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.

     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
     Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
     to the Lock.

                                JONES
                   Your suit, Becky!

                                BECK
                   Just get in yours!

     Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his
     suit.

     Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving
     along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner
     from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.

     Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves
     along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM
     BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE
     TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.

     BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
     the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck.

                                WILLIE
                                (screams)
                   Look out!

     But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and
     sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to
     see Jones seal himself into his suit.

                                JONES/RADIO
                   I'm in.

                                BECK
                                (to the others)
                   Go!

                                WILLIE/RADIO
                   No!

     THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK

     Beck looks at the others one last time.

                                BECK
                   Go, now!  That's an order!

     Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the
     elevator sends them down without Beck.

     BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he
     swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the
     upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck
     freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head
     is the grotesque face of DeJesus!

     DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips
     tremble in agony.

                                DEJESUS
                   Kill me...Kill me!

     Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with
     the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.

     As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock
     elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it
     out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the
     Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  "One minute to
     implosion..."

     Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit.
     His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy
     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
     generator.

     BECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter
     of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature
     charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck
     out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his
     motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking
     it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the
     elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!

                                BECK
                   No!

     He hits again, still nothing!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE..."Nineteen, eighteen..."  Her
     voice begins to quiver.

     BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE
     DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND
     BECK'S LEG!

     CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time
     and NNNNNNNNNNNN!

     THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK
     OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH
     IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!

     UNDERWATER - LATER

     WHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward
     the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us.
     Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A
     moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the
     darkness after the first.

     BECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
     helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
     he moves closer to the surface.

     WILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her
     light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then
     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At
     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then
     we see it again--a glimmer of light.

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Light.  Beck, I see light!

     ON BECK

     He follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as
     they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click
     off..."125, 100, 75..."

                                BECK(RADIO)
                   Wait till you reach thirty-
                   five before you blow your suit...

                                WILLIE'S VOICE(RADIO)
                   Roger.

     WILLIE'S POV  Her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."

                                WILLIE(RADIO)
                   Ejecting.

     She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The
     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her
     hand gropes for it.

     SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES
     UPWARD.

     WHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.

     No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie
     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.

     SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE
     SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE
     SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.

     Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull
     the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE
     HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   We made it!

                                BECK
                   Where's Jones?

     Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At
     the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck
     breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach
     Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water
     and inflates his life jacket.

                                WILLIE
                   Is he okay?

     Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a
     moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint
     against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he
     and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up."

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                                (jubilant)
                   The sun!  The sun!

     Jones looks at Beck and grins.

                                JONES
                   What happened to that typhoon?

     CALM SEA - LATER

     BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search
     the horizon.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you sure you saw something?

                                JONES
                   How many times I got to tell
                   you.  I saw a ship.

                                WILLIE
                   Well, why haven't they answered
                   our flares?

                                BECK
                   We'll fire one more, that
                   leaves us one last one.

     BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
     water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.

                                WILLIE
                   Are you okay, Jonesy?

                                JONES
                                (weakly)
                   Tip top, Willie...tip top.

                                WILLIE
                                (testing him)
                   Who's the best power forward
                   in the NBA...Jameson?

                                JONES
                                (tired, but
                                with fight)
                   Jameson?  Who are you trying
                   to con...?

     They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.

                                BECK
                   I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!

     As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
     fading against the sky.

                                WILLIE
                   It saw us!

                                JONES
                   Answer them and quit kicking me!

                                WILLIE
                   I'm not touching you!

     WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the
     flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the
     first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.

                                WILLIE
                   No...no, no, no.

     The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.

     EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME

     A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
     speaks to someone O.S.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought you said you'd
                   combed this area?

     He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
     standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and
     smiles coolly as he lies.

                                MARTIN
                   We did....Many times.

                                CAPTAIN
                                (looks at Martin
                                then to a Lieutenant)
                   Initiate rescue.

     We hold on Martin's face as from

     THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP

     A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
     off toward the fading flare.

     OCEAN - SAME

     Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.
     Suddenly Willie feels another bump.

                                WILLIE
                                (panicky)
                   It hit me!  Where are they?!

                                BECK
                   I can't see them!

     Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.  Willie sees one only two
     feet away.  They are surrounded.  Suddenly Jones stare to
     taunt the sharks aggressively.

                                JONES
                   All right!  I've had enough
                   of this shit!  You want meat,
                   motherfucker?  Come on, eat
                   me, sucker, try some dark meat!

     He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop
     him.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (taunting sharks)
                   What's wrong you snout-nosed
                   bastards?  My meat too tough
                   for you?!

     Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck
     watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Willie and Beck)
                   Whoa!  Did you see those fools
                   run?  They know whose boss.

     He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
     SEE a gash across his forearm.

     UNDERWATER POV

     As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
     RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!

     SURFACE/OCEAN

     Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something
     is happening...

     WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,
     THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over
     the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave
     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!

     UNDERWATER

     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and
     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!

     THE HELICOPTER

     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its
     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR
     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.
     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!

     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water
     where

     BECK grabs the harness.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, Jones!

     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN
     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND
     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR
     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.

                                BECK
                   Jonesy, No!

                                JONES
                   Get out of here, Becky!

     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.
     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he
     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a
     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles
     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs
     to the surface several feet away from Beck.

     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!
     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life
     vest as the Creature starts for him.

     ON HELICOPTER

     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
     Creature bears down on Beck.

                                WINCH OPERATOR
                   Is he in the harness!

     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers
     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'
     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!

     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body
     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.

                                BECK
                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!

     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck
     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly
     pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!  The rescue
     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!

     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the
     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the
     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean
     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.
     The winch operator pulls him in.

     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER

     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of
     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and
     shakes his hand.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Mr. Beck, I understand
                   you passed your physical with
                   flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?

                                BECK
                                (worried)
                   I don't know yet, she's still
                   in there.

                                CAPTAIN
                   Well, you'll be glad to know
                   you have a friend onboard.

     Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.

                                MARTIN
                                (excitedly)
                   Beck!  I told them you'd
                   make it.  No one back at
                   TransOcean believed me, but
                   I never gave up on you once.
                                (smiling)
                   So, how are you feeling?

     Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
     one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
     the deck.

                                BECK
                   Better...A lot better.

     Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
     with a new outfit on.  Smiles at Beck.

                                WILLIE
                   I'm fine!

     Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
     approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING
     THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.
     The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.  The
     Captain notices.

                                CAPTAIN
                   I thought we might have some
                   wonderful seafood.  But, if there's
                   something else you'd rather have...

     Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
     the Captain and smiles.

                                WILLIE
                   How about a burger and fries?

     She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
     deck with the Captain.

     AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
     distance and WE ARE AT THE

     SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

     riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping
     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
     depths.





                                THE END
"LITTLE NICKY" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven Brill

 


	FADE IN:

	EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT

	A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
	sprinkling.

	We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
	where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
	has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
	the lights turn on.

				PEEPER
			(whispering)
		Showtime!

	We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
	window.  She is wearing business attire.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
			(takes bite of sandwich)
		Well you'll feel better once you slip
		off those work clothes and get into some
		sweats.

	The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
	her feet.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
		rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
		use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

	He sips some wine.

	The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
	revealing a nice bra.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Looks like Victoria just told me her
		secret.

	The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
	the words as he goes.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
		first brassiere sighting...
			(stops writing)
		I will pleasure myself to this image for
		months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

	The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
	in wearing a scouts uniform.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What
		unfortunate timing.  You mother was just
		getting comfy.

	The son talks to his mother excitedly.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
		knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

	The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Now what.  This simply won't do.

	The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
	answers.

				SCOTTIE
		Hello?

				PEEPER
		Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
		downstairs like a good boy and let your
		mother freshen up.

				SCOTTIE
		Who is this?

				PEEPER
		Just a little birdie.  A birdie who
		wants to see if your mother's panties
		match her bra.

				MOTHER
		Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
		our tree?

	The peeper gets nervous.

				PEEPER
		Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
		bird.

	The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
	We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
	shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
	to the ground with a thud.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
		wear your bikini.

	The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
	out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

					   HARD CUT:

	INT. HOLE - DAY

	The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
	all sides.

	The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
	screaming like a five-year old girl.

	PEEPER'S POV

	We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
	peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He
	SCREAMS.

	EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL

	We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
	We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
	a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

	Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
	fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
	clothes are now burned & shredded).

				GATEKEEPER (O.S.)
		Welcome!

	The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
	station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

				PEEPER
		Am I in hell?

				GATEKEEPER
		What do you think?

	A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
	leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

	MATTE PAINTING HELL

	MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN

	The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
	like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
	the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
	castle, to one particular window.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY

	Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
	heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
	bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
	song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
	"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."

	The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
	NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

				NICKY
			(embarrassed)
		Hey...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your father wants to see you and your
		brothers in the throne room.

				NICKY
		Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is
		rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

	INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

	ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
	people's faces that are coming through the wall.

				CASSIUS
		I knew it.  He's finally retiring.

				ADRIAN
		I've been waiting on this day for ten
		thousand years.

	He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaah!

				CASSIUS
		If the old man picks me to take over
		Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
		four seven.  No breaks.

				ADRIAN
		Well Dad says it's the breaks that make
		the torture.  You have to let people
		feel a sense of relief.

	Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
	in the eye.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

				ADRIAN
		Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring
		is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

	Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

				CASSIUS
		I'll take that.

	Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
	It splatters like a grape.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Was that really necessary?

	Nicky enters sheepishly.

				CASSIUS
		Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
		today?

				NICKY
		Good, thanks.

	Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

				CASSIUS
		Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

	Cassius' eyes start glowing red.

				NICKY
		Actually, I'll take a rain check on0

	Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
	force.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!

				NICKY
			(picking up his head)
		Yes, you got me...

	Nicky's head slams back down again.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya, again!

				NICKY
			(picking head up)
		Got me for sure, yes...

	He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
	head.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...

	Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
	own crotch.

				NICKY
		Oh no.  Please Cassius...

	Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
	until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Aaaaah.

	Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
	hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
	notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
	devil horns), enters behind them.

				DAD
		What are you boys doing?

	Cassius releases Nicky's hand.

				NICKY
		Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
		furniture.

				DAD
		Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
		of your brother's mind?

				CASSIUS
		I forgot.

				DAD
		Maybe this will help you remember.

	Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
	nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
	floor.

	Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
	confidence and power.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		Now everybody sit down.

				NICKY
		Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
		down my monsters of metal compilation
		tape.  I really think it's a
		masterpiece.

				DAD
		Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

	He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
	window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
	head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
	closes the curtains.

	Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
	his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
	of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
	his three sons.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
		thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
		here in hell for ten thousand years.
		And after this ten thousand years had
		passed, he decided to abdicate his
		throne...

	Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		...to step aside.
			(Nicky lowers his hand)
		...and let me become the ruler of hell.
		This, as some of you might know, is my
		ten thousandth year as Prince of
		Darkness.  So I think the time has come
		to discuss who will succeed me.

	Jimmy the Demon walks in.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Knock, knock.

				DAD
		Yes, Jimmy.

	He whispers in Dad's ear.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		No, no, that's not what I said.  He can
		keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
		go.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
			(turning to leave)
		Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
		pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
		o'clock.

	Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
	back to his sons.

				DAD
		This was a very difficult decision,
		because I have three wonderful sons.  I
		mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
		And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
		Nicky, so...so...

				NICKY
		Don't worry about coming up with
		anything.  It's cool.

				DAD
		Such a sweet boy.  But after much
		thought and careful consideration, I've
		decided that the ruler for the next ten
		thousand years is going to have to
		be...me.

				CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
			(dumbfounded)
		What!?

				NICKY
		Hallelujah.

	They all look at Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I mean...tough break.

				DAD
		The important thing for the stability of
		our rule is to maintain the balance
		between good and evil.  And I don't
		think any of you are ready for that
		responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
		that comes only with the passage of
		time.

				CASSIUS
		Dad!  This is Hoyashit.

	Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
	Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
	tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

				DAD
		Right.  Right.  Send him in.
			(to the boys)
		I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
		to work.

	Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

				ADRIAN
		You sure about this decision, Dad?

				DAD
		I'm telling you, pal, it's the right
		thing to do.

	HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
	Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

	Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
	a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
	over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
	Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
	Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

	CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES

	As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

				HITLER
		Holy schnit!!

	EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

	Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
	with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
	looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

				CASSIUS
		You work your ass off for ten thousand
		years, hurting people, helping others
		hurt people, then you get a decision
		like that.

				ADRIAN
		And he's dead serious.

				CASSIUS
		It's just such a slap in the face.

	Adrian turns to the Monster.

				ADRIAN
		Um, excuse me, we're having a private
		conversation here.

				CASSIUS
		Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

	Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
	The Monster shrugs and walks off.

				ADRIAN
		Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
		Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
		hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
		getting tired of serving in Hell.  We
		need a place where we can rule.

	Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
	around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
	Cassius sees this and gets enraged.

				CASSIUS
		Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
		on!! Let's see what you got!

	The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
	an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

				CASSIUS (CONT'D)
		That's what I thought!

				ADRIAN
			(to Cassius)
		Could you concentrate for five seconds?

				CASSIUS
		I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

				ADRIAN
		What do you think about...Earth?

	Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		We could create our own hell there.

				CASSIUS
		You saying we go up there and kill
		everyone?

				ADRIAN
		Eventually, Cassius.  But first we
		corrupt as many as we can so that when
		we do destroy them...

				CASSIUS
		...their damned souls will be ours.

				ADRIAN
		It's our time, brother.

	The two look at each other.  They start running toward the
	fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey, what are you doing?!?

	They get closer to the fire.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You can't go through there.  The fire
		flows in, not out.

	They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You know something?  You guys suck!  You
		really suck!

	Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
	hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
	firewall hard.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
	tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
	Pause.  Dad exhales.

				DAD
		Now that was an experience.  "You are
		only coming through in waves."  That
		line blows my mind every time.

				NICKY
		Definitely.

				DAD
		I don't care what kind of mood you're in
		at the start of that song.  When it's
		over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
		Great shit.  What's next?

				NICKY
		Well, I thought that after messing with
		your head, I'd give you a little kick in
		the keester.

	Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

				DAD
		Who is this, Metal-lick-a?

				NICKY
		Metallica, Dad.  Come on.

				DAD
		I was just playing with you.

	Dad and Nicky dance to the song.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	CLOSE ON DAD.

				DAD
		I'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
		I regretfully have to decline.

	ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.

				DAN
		C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
		Superbowl ring.

				DAD
		In exchange for eternal damnation of
		your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
		me to want to do that to you, Mr.
		Marino.

				DAN
		You did it for Namath.

				DAD
		Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
		Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
		records and the Hall of Fame and the
		beautiful family and all that.

				DAN
		This is bullshit, man.
			(gets up to leave)
		I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
		with or without you!

				DAD
		Now you're talking.

	Dan exits.

				NICKY
		You're a good devil, Dad.

				DAD
		And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

	Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
	sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
	knees.

				GATEKEEPER
		Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
		escaped from hell.  They went through
		the fire, and they broke it.  I think
		they took the New York tunnel.  I tried
		to stop them, but they overpowered me,
		sir.

				DAD
		Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
		your knees.

	The Gatekeeper stands up.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks for being so understanding, your
		worship.  You're the man.  You've always
		been the man.

	Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
	boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
	only see them from the front for a second.
	From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
	nipples as he talks to Nicky.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
			(to Nicky)
		I'm lucky to get away with just the head
		boobs, right?

				NICKY
		Coulda been much worse.

				GATEKEEPER
		That's what I'm thinkin'...

	Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

				DAD
		This is bad, Nicky.

				NICKY
		How bad?

				DAD
		I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
		broken, no new souls can get in, which
		means I'll start to deteriorate into
		nothing.

	GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

				LUCIFER
		What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

				DAD
		Everything's fine, pop.

				LUCIFER
		Last time you said that the renaissance
		happened.

				DAD
		Please, pop, just go back to your room.

				LUCIFER
			(regarding gateskeeper)
		Can I take him with me and have sex with
		his head?

				DAD
		Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.

	The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

				GATEKEEPER
		Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
		lifestyle for me, isn't it.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER

	We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
	SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

	The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

	Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

				DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
		What's going on?  Where are we?

	We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
	thuds.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Nothing's getting through that.  The
		fire is solid as a rock.

				NICKY
		We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
		Ideas?

				DAD
		To do that Cassius and Adrian have to
		come back through the other way.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Dad!

				DAD
		I'm too weak.  The process has already
		begun.

	Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
	see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Jimmy!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
		devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
		up there with your brothers.

				NICKY
		You're not saying it's up to me?

	The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
	if to say, "oh no."

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I've never been to Earth.  I've never
		even slept over at some other dude's
		house!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
		in you.

				DAD
		Nicky, the worst thing that could happen
		on Earth is you get killed, in which
		case, boom, you end up back here.

				NICKY
		Are you telling me I have to go to Earth
		and kill my brothers?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Not go.  They left together at the exact
		same time.  They gotta come back
		together at the exact same time.

	Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

				DAD
		Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One
		sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
		you've got both of them, you bring the
		flask back through the gate.

	Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
	The Monster gags.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your ol' man's got less than a week.

	Nicky looks petrified.

				NICKY
		No.  This can't be happening.

				DAD
		Son, just do your best.

	Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
	who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

	Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
	taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
	a move on."

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL

	PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
	two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
	surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
	distance.

				NICKY
		Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
		doesn't look too bad.

	Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
	WHAMMM!

			EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
	the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were gone ten seconds.  What
		happened?

				NICKY
		I got hit by a big light that was
		attached to a lot of metal.

				DAD
		That's a train, son.  Don't stand in
		front of them.

				NICKY
		Well, I guess I'm going to have to take
		a mulligan on this one.

				DAD
		Please, Nicky, get back up there.
			(his ear falls off)
		Try to hurry.

	Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
	hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is
	stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
	In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
	identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
	scrawled "NICKY."

	Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

				NICKY
		I'm Nicky.

	Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.

				BEEFY
			(voice of Sandy Wernick)
		Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track
		and come with me, shitstains.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY

	The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
	are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
	around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

				BEEFY
		My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
		your father's.  He's asked me to help
		you out.

				NICKY
		I just need to find my brothers and be
		on my way, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
		can possess people.  So they probably
		won't look like themselves.  You have to
		be suspicious of everyone.

	Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

				NICKY
		Okay, "bro," this jig is up...
			(pulling out the flask)
		Just get in the bottle.  Just slide
		right on in there.

				BEEFY
		It's not me, moron.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry.

	EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put
	money in his pot.

				PREACHER
		Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his
		children.
			(passerby puts in money)
		He thanks you for your kindness.
			(another woman puts in money)
		God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
		The Lord loves you...

	We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
	sniffs.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		The Lord does not love you.  I
		sense...pure evil.
			(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
		   face)
		You make the Lord very nervous.
			(feeling hot)
		I'm burning...ahhh.
			(running away)
		The Devil walks among us!

	He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

	He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
	disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Makin' friends already.

				NICKY
			(shivering a little)
		It's freezing up here, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
		the same physical needs and limitations
		a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get
		you some warm clothes.

				NICKY
		I also have this odd pain in my mid
		section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...

				BEEFY
		That pain is hunger.

	EXT. BENCH - DAY

	K-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
	an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
	is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
	CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

				NICKY
		So far, so good.  Now what?

				BEEFY
		Put it in your mouth.

	Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Move your teeth up and down.

	Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
		head back and let the meat slide down
		your throat-hole.

	Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

				NICKY
		Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

				BEEFY
		It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
		gonna need your energy.

				NICKY
		I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's
		get cracking!

	NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
	into the path of a moving bus.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
	gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
	enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
	the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

	The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
	embarrassed.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey.

				NICKY
		That's a pretty brassiere.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks.

				NICKY
		Could you maybe not tell anyone about
		this?

				GATEKEEPER
		You got it.  Could you maybe not tell
		anyone about this?

				NICKY
		You got it.

	Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
	back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
	love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
	(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

	Beefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
	cautious.

				NICKY
		From now on.  I'm just going to avoid
		all moving metal objects.

				BEEFY
		Great.  Now your father gave me some
		deposit money for a nice pad on the
		Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

	Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne
	is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS
	dancing for him.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET

	Nicky and Beefy.

				BEEFY
		So I found this other joint for you.
		But you're gonna have a roommate.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
	phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

				TODD
			(on phone)
		I know exactly how you feel... The night
		Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
		"Is this man going to blow up the world,
		Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
		hour.
			(knock at the door)
		Somebody's here.  Call you later.

	Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
	his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

				NICKY
		Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
		understand you're seeking a roommate, as
		per your advertisement in the Village
		Voice.  Would it be possible for me to
		fill the slot?

				TODD
		Uh, don't you want to know what the rent
		is?

	Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both
	nod imperceptibly.

				NICKY
		Yes.  What is rent?

				TODD
		Eight-hundred, split down the middle.
		Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
		my scene partner so the living room will
		be off limits.

				NICKY
		Off limits.

				TODD
		Right.  And as far as household items:
		we can share the soap, but we'll split
		the cost 60/40.
		Cause the person who physically goes out
		and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
		as much as the other guy.
			(looks at Nicky)
		Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

				NICKY
		No.

				TODD
		It's like eighty degrees in this
		hallway.  You from the South?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  The deep South.

	Nicky laughs a little too hard.

				TODD
		Why is that funny?

				NICKY
		I don't know.

				TODD
		And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

	Todd turns and goes into the apartment.

				BEEFY
		You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day
		tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep
		thing I told you about.

				NICKY
		Got ya.
			(to Todd)
		Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

				TODD
		Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

	The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It
	reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over
	it.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM

	Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
	clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
	familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we
	hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

	SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
	looking concerned.

	EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

	We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a
	large church.

	INT. CATHEDRAL

	CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the
	steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
	We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He
	gins his homily.

				CARDINAL
		In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
		we are to live if we wish to attain the
		splendor of Heaven... or something like
		that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
		the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.
		Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
	standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
	with the top open.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
		hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
		done anything for us?  Has he ever put a
		Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever
		given any of my enemies the herpes?  No.
		He hasn't done a damn thing for any of
		us.

	A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		The Lord gave my son the strength to get
		off drugs.

				CARDINAL
		Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,
		he was better off on drugs.  He's a
		bore.  At least when he was smoking
		hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

	A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

				YOUNG MAN
		After we tried for many years, the Lord
		finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

				CARDINAL
		No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
		wife conceive a baby.  He helped her
		conceive it all night long.

	Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
	to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
	points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
		do anything for you?

	The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

				MAYOR
			(standing)
		Well, I wish I could think of something,
		Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
		can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
		there even is a Lord.  If there is any
		ultimate punishment for our so-called
		"sins."  Maybe we should all just have
		fun and do whatever the hell we want.

	A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
	again, this time energetically.

				CARDINAL
		Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!

	The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
	over the money in the collection plate.

	The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
	Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Oh, this is delicious.

	ON MAYOR

	He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
			(laughing)
		"Let the sin begins" - that was a good
		one.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Well, we must get people sinning if we
		want to fill up our New Hell.  How are
		things going down at City Hall?

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		I lowered the drinking age to ten.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I
		never want it to end.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

	The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

	Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the
	same.

				NICKY
		This is intense!  And it happens every
		day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my
		hat to you people!

				BEEFY
		Look, it's okay for me to shit the
		street.  But you gotta use a toilet.

				NICKY
			(pulling up pants)
		Okay, just point me in the right
		direction next time.

				BEEFY
		Come on, there's like ten million people
		in this city and the clock is ticking.

				NICKY
		Well, let's rock and roll.

	Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE
	DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking
	him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.
		You froze the gate and you're killing
		him.  Drink!

	Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

				CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
		I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

				NICKY
		just get in the flask!

	The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
	to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to
		the head is gonna make me throw in the
		towel?  Well, in the immortal words of
		Judas Priest, "You got another thing
		comin'."

	Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
	bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot
	long lense, real people, real reactions.)

	INT. POPEYE'S - DAY

	Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
	Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
	Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
	ordering some chicken.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in
	his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
	it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries
	to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he
	grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at
	Nicky as he walks away.

	INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

	Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the
	polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the
	flask.

	INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
	The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

				GATEKEEPER
		Bus?

				NICKY
		Beast.

	The Monster laughs.

				GATEKEEPER
			(to Monster)
		You like that?  You think that's funny?

	The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		How about that?  You like that?

	The Monster howls with delight.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
	Popeye's drumstick.

				NICKY
		All that running and chasing is making
		the sleep thing want to come early.

				BEEFY
		I think we have to work on narrowing

	Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.
	Beefy sighs.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
		begging to come out...

	Beefy walks away.

	EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY

	Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky
	snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

	ON WORRIED PEOPLE

	Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL
	GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
	goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:
	it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

				PETER
		Sounds like our devil dance actually
		worked this time.

				JOHN
		'Bout time...

	Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The
	worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the
	Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

	Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		There's our man.

				PETER
		Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
		to the dark side.

	A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes
	the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

				JOHN
		What's with that guy?

				PETER
		Gotta be one of his disciples or
		something.

	Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
	drumstick) and runs off.

				JOHN
		Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
		ripped off.

				PETER
		Should we wake him up?

				JOHN
		Yeah.  You do it.

	Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud
	SNORT.

				PETER
		Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude
		just stole your shit.

	Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

				NICKY
		Oh nooooo....

	Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Which way did he go?

				JOHN
		That way.

	Nicky is about to run off.  Looks at John's shirt.

				NICKY
		Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
		phenomenal.

	He runs off.

				PETER
		Did you check out the dragon mouth?

				JOHN
		The Dark Prince is here.

	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

	Nicky is searching the street for his flask.  He walks past
	several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
	sidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
	sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
	blanket of the VENDOR.

				NICKY
		Hey...

				STREET VENDOR
		See something you like, my man?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I would like my flask back.

	The street vendor stands, very angry.

				STREET VENDOR
		You callin' me a thief, my man?

				NICKY
		No, I'm just calling you... a guy who
		has my flask.

				STREET VENDOR
		And if that is your so-called "flask,"
		how would I have it unless I was, in
		fact, a thief?

				NICKY
			(not sure what the answer is)
		I don't know?

	A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

				MAN
		Yeah, how much for the silver flask
		there?

				STREET VENDOR
		Well, that's a very special item.  The
		cap itself is one hundred percent
		plappium.  It's a value is over three
		thousand dollars.

				MAN
		Really.  Where's it from?

				NICKY
		It was handcrafted in hell by Satan
		himself and is only to be used for the
		capture and containment of my blood
		brothers so that the firefall of Hades
		will burn brightly once again.

				MAN
		Really.  I think we'll let you keep it
		then.

	He walks away.

				STREET VENDOR
		Okay, now you gone and done it.  You
		done messed with my business bitch!

				NICKY
		Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise
		your voice.  It's making my muscles
		tighten.

	We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

				STREET VENDOR
		Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
		I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's
		get busy.

	The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
	swinging his fists around.

	Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
	selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's
	going on.

	Nicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

				VALERIE
		Excuse me, does that flask belong to
		this man?

				STREET VENDOR
			(frustrated)
		Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

				VALERIE
		Look, I know you come out here and sell
		stolen stuff all the time.  But today,
		the guy you stole from just happened to
		walk by and bust you.  So why don't you
		admit today's not your day and give him
		his flask back?

				STREET VENDOR
		Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly
		me to death?

				VALERIE
		No, but maybe that cop over there might
		have something to say.

	Valerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor
	ponders this for a second, then...

				STREET VENDOR
		Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
			(looking at Valerie)
		And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
		and find a new corner.  Before I show
		you what real crazy is.

	The vendor does crazy eyes again.

				VALERIE
		Fine.  I will.

	Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

				NICKY
		Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a
		few years.

	Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky
	follows her.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You
		didn't have to do that.

				VALERIE
		That's okay.  I get messed with all the
		time and when I saw him doing that to
		you I just lost it.  I hate when people
		take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it
		for the rest of us.

				NICKY
		You think I'm a tourist?

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent
		maybe.  Where are you from?

				NICKY
		The South.

				VALERIE
		Really?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  Deep south.
			(laughs hard)

	She laughs along with him, not sure why.

				VALERIE
		Why are you laughing?

				NICKY
		I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your
		glasses are nice.  They make your eyes
		look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look
		at them.

				VALERIE
		My dad's an optometrist.

				NICKY
		My dad's in hell, and he's falling
		apart.

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your
		parents get older.

				NICKY
		If I don't save him, I don't know what
		I'm gonna do.

				VALERIE
		Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like
		you will figure something out.

	Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He
	hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

				NICKY
		Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick
		ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

				VALERIE
		That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I
		actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

				NICKY
		Could I come with you to getting a
		Gelati?

				VALERIE
		If you want to.

				NICKY
		Want to?  A million angry octopus people
		couldn't hold me back!

				VALERIE
		"Octopus people?"

				NICKY
		Uh, it's a deep south expression.

	Nicky laughs.

	EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

	They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.

				NICKY
		It's freezing my hands.

				VALERIE
		It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap
		it.

	Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just
	then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head,
	sensing Nicky.

				PREACHER
		Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
		Your evil is stinking up our streets!
		We're all gonna die!

	He takes off running right into a lamp post.

				VALERIE
		This town is really going to hell
		lately.
			(Nicky nods)
		So what part of the city do you live in?

				NICKY
		I have an apartment.  I don't remember
		exactly where.  My dog knows, though.

				VALERIE
			(laughs)
		You have a dog?  What kind?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's
		uptown talking to his contacts.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

	Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.

				BEEFY
		Remember, it's not the size of the boat,
		it's the motion of the ocean.

				GIRL DOG
		Just finish.

	EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY

				VALERIE
		I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to
		school full time.  It wouldn't be fair
		to the dog.

				NICKY
		School?

				VALERIE
		Parsons School of Design.  I knew
		growing up I wasn't much to look at, so
		I put my energy into making things that
		are pretty.

				NICKY
		What's that pleasant smell coming from,
		your skin?

				VALERIE
		My perfume?

	He takes her wrist to his nose.  He stares at it, licks it.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
			(laughs)
		It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
		Which I think is the French word for
		coconuts.

	Nicky stops and looks at her.

				NICKY
		Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch
		of butterflies flapping around in my
		stomach.  Is that normal?

				VALERIE
		Sometimes, sure.

				NICKY
		Good.  I was concerned.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  We hear loud
	wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

				GATEKEEPER
		Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I
		hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.

	The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
	biker's hat.  He nods along in agreement.

	PAN TO LUCIFER

	Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
	fire/pond.

				LUCIFER
		You know, I was the one who created
		Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		I know, your wickedness.

				LUCIFER
		I started slow, though.  For years, I
		was just giving people hot foots.
		Actually, you can give all the credit
		for Hell to my first wife; she was the
		inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too.
		One day, she asked me if I wanted super
		sex.  I said I'll take the soup.

	The Monster laughs really hard.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact,
		you look like her mother, except she had
		more hair.

	The Monster laughs even harder.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		You know what was in Hell when I came
		down here, Cassius?

				GATEKEEPER
		It's Stanley, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles.
		Looked like a giant parking lot.  It
		wasn't even called Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		What was it called, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Boogerland!

				GATEKEEPER
		That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you
		just enjoy the fishing?

				LUCIFER
		I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing.
		I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I
		catch everything...

	We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's
	fishing line to:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

	We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A
	giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head
	is sticking out.

				PEEPER
		I deserve this!

	EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

	Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.

				KID
		I just stole twenty-five bucks off the
		bar.

				KID #2
		How many beers did you have?

				KID # 3
		Eight sips.

				KID
		I had five!  I'm so wasted.

	They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN
	sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
	of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

				ADRIAN
		When an adult goes to Hell, that's
		terrific.  But when a child goes...
		that's why I'm in this business.

	Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with
	Valerie.  He's shocked.

	Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
	collection.

				NICKY
		So you're saying, make all pants with a
		drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
		have to feel humiliated by telling their
		waist size in front of the whole store?

				VALERIE
		Basically, yeah.

				NICKY
		Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring
		socks for gals with fat ankles.

	Valerie laughs.

				VALERIE
		You know what's nice about you?  You
		just seem happy being yourself.  You
		don't try to act cool.

				NICKY
		Thanks much.  You know what's nice about
		you, Valerie?

				VALERIE
		What?

	Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's
	been stunned by something.

				NICKY
		Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

				VALERIE
		What was that?

				NICKY
			(shocked and confused)
		I...I don't know why I just said that.
		I meant to say that...

					 QUICK CUT TO:

	Adrian's eyes flashing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		...I've always wanted to have sex with a
		gross pig.  What do you say we go behind
		that dumpster, pull our pants down and
		see what happens?

	Valerie's very hurt.

				VALERIE
		You're a jerk.

	She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.
	His inner voice speaks to him.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		ADRIAN!

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		You shouldn't have come here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Please, get out of my mind!

	Adrian's eyes flash.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Valerie!

	She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist
	Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up,
	giving her the "finger."

				VALERIE
		What the hell's your problem?

	She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still
	across the street.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
		Dad's sick.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He's sick?

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Yeah, he needs souls to live.  When you
		guys left, you broke the gates.  We
		gotta get the gates burning again before
		he dies.

	Adrian processes this.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He should have thought of that before he
		denied me my birthright.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Well maybe you should go back and talk
		it over with him.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		How about this?  I stay here enjoying my
		Schnapps and you go back.

	Nicky's body jerks around.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, please...

	Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
	crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
	truck bearing down on him.

	JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.  Peter looks
	down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

				PETER
		Check this out.  The number of the
		beast.

	They laugh and hi-five.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	INT. CBS EVENING NEWS PROGRAM

	Dan Rather speaks to the camera.  Over his shoulder we see a
	graphic of the Arch-Decon's face.  NOTE (Arch-Decon is a made
	up religious figure that appeared earlier in the script.)

				DAN RATHER
		Reverberations from Arch-Decon
		Donnelly's shocking speech are still

	A few CATS are down in the aisle physically pushing around
	shocked audience members.

	BACK ON DAN RATHER

	VIDEO FOOTAGE

				REGIS
		So I was driving to work today, and some
		bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...

				KATHY LEE
		Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

				REGIS
		So I followed him...

				KATHY LEE
		You followed him?

				REGIS
		I followed him all the way downtown, and
		when he gets out of the car, I reach
		under my seat and pull out an aluminum
		bat.

				KATHY LEE
		You keep a bat under your seat?

				REGIS
		Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this
		guy, and start bashing his brains in
		with this bat, and it made me feel
		happy!  Did you ever see THE
		UNTOUCHABLES?

				KATHY LEE
		Yes, great movie...

				REGIS
		I was DeNiro!

	The blue haired lady AUDIENCE is crying.  The TV turns off.
	We PULL BACK to see that we are in.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Your brothers are upsetting the balance
		of good and evil.

				NICKY
		What can I do about it?

				BEEFY
		You can't do jack shit... unless you
		learn your evil powers.

				NICKY
		Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those
		dudes put the wick in wicked.

				BEEFY
		Go get a soda out of the fridge.

				NICKY
		But those are my roommate's sodas...

				BEEFY
			(high-pitched mocking)
		"But those are my roommate's sodas..."
		Does that sound like a statement the son
		of the devil would make?

	Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it
	on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare
	at the Coke.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		You have the power to change the cola in
		that can into any other liquid - engine
		oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just
		have to release the evil within you.

				NICKY
		Release the evil?

				BEEFY
		I'm just saying, there's wickedness in
		you... I can tell from your snores.

	Nicky stares at the can.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Release your evil...

	Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little.

				TODD
		What are you doing?

	Todd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire
	escape.

	*******************

				TODD (CONT'D)
		I know it's your living room night.  But

	The TV clicks on.  We see TODD sit down and look at the TV.
	Nicky's behind him.

	ON TV

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

				BILL WALTON
		What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse
		85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal
		run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,
		seem to be struggling to find their
		groove in front of their hometown fans.

	A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
	makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE
	GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and
	makes the travelling signal.

				REF
		He's walking, get him a bus!

				BILL WALTON
		Oh, another awful call.  There is no way
		that was travelling.

	Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.

				CORNROWS
		What's with all these crazy calls?  You
		gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
		game in 53 years.

				REF
		Technical foul!

	Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY
		That guy in the striped shirt snaps his
		fingers like someone I know...

	ON TV

	The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously
	slam their heads on the scorers table again and again.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		It looks like the work of a brother...

				TODD
		A black guy?

				NICKY
		If it's Cassius, yes.

	Nicky races for the door.

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

	As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's
	shirt yells out.

				GLOBETROTTER FAN
		Get your head out your ass, ref!  The
		kids came to see the Globetrotters win.

				REF
		Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
		Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
		in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten
		points off for the Globetrotters.

	The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36.

	ON STANDS

	The KIDS are crying.

	ON COURT

	The halftime buzzer sounds.  The Globetrotters walk off the

				BILL WALTON
		In all my years of basketball, I was
		never so happy to hear a halftime
		buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second
		half doesn't get any better, I expect a
		full scale riot.

	A spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.

				COURT ANNOUNCER
		It's time for the Globetrotter's
		halftime half-court heave throw, where
		one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
		thousand dollars!

	A brick lands at the announcer's feet.

		And if he makes it, everyone in

		No.

	Bill Walton's hair is on fire.

				BILL WALTON
		I think that ball just blew up.  And

	Nicky throws an underhand shot.  The ball arcs through the

	Cornrow's cornrows POP open into a GIANT AFRO.

	BACK ON NICKY

	Nicky's head starts turning and does a 360 (like the
	Exorcist).  He ends his flight by slamming down a thunderous
	dunk, cracking the backboard's glass into pieces.  He hits
	the ref on the way down.  The crowd CHEERS, finally happy
	again.

				NICKY
		Never doubt my skills.

	INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

				CORNROWS
		Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.

	MID-COURT

	Nicky sees the ref is lying on the basketball arena floor,
	covered in glass.  He gets up slowly

				REF
		That's nuts.  When'd you learn that
		shit?

				NICKY
		Sorry, Cassius.  Maybe it was the super
		devil juice Dad gave me.  HE thought I
		might need it for just such an occasion.

				REGIS
		Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's
		go best two out of three.

				NICKY
			(pulls out the flask)
		No.  No way.  Dad said it was only for
		me.

	The ref rips the flask from Nicky and drinks.

	Cassius screams like bloody hell as he is sucked out of the
	ref's mouth and into the bottle.  WHOOSH!  The ref slumps to
	the floor.

	STANDS

	Still quiet until John and Peter rush to Nicky and bow.

	COURTSIDE

	Nicky peers into the flask.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Damn you, Nicky!  There ain't no super
		devil juice in here!

	Nicky caps the flask.  Nicky waves to the stunned, but
	appreciative crowd.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A homemade cake is laid out.  It reads: CONGRATULATIONS,
	NICKY.  JOHN, TODD, PETER AND BEEFY are there.

				TODD
		So your father's the devil, you're a
		talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys
		are who?

				PEEPER
		Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and
		the work his Dad does.

				JOHN
		By the way, Nicky.  Check this out.

	He spins his Black Sabbath backwards.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		What's Ozzy trying to say there?

				NICKY
		Absolutely nothing.  The Blizzard always
		came straight with his messages.  But
		wrap your minds around this one.

	Nicky gets up and we see his is sitting on a hibachi.  He pus
	on a James Taylor album and plays it backwards.

				VOICE
		I command you in the name of the Lucifer
		to spread the blood of the innocent.

	John and Peter look at each other, shocked.

				JOHN
		No wonder your uncle's so weird...

				TODD
		I gotta say this cake tastes a little
		funny.

				PETER
		Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the
		mix.  Tried to spice up the bash.

	Nicky takes a big bite of cake.

				NICKY
		What's reefer?

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. APARTMENT - LATER

	PAN UP from Popeye's laying everywhere.  Everyone's laughing
	hard.

				JOHN
		Come on.  One more time.

				NICKY
		Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts.

				PETER
		Please.  You got to.

				NICKY
			(resigned)
		All right...

	Nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360
	degrees.  Everyone cracks up, high fives.  Even Todd LAUGHS.
	PAN OVER to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes.

				BEEFY
		I used to get baked like this with my
		first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so
		stoned she would forget I was a dog.

				JOHN
		She was human?

				BEEFY
		Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man,
		that pissed my parents off.

				JOHN
		I dated a Japanese girl once.  My
		parents disapproved.  Not cause she's
		Japanese, but cause she was only
		fifteen.

				NICKY
		I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.

	Everyone cracks up.

				TODD
		I was in love one time but she said I
		wasn't financially reliable enough.  And
		she needed that.

				JOHN
		By she, do you mean he?

				TODD
		No.

				BEEFY
		Busted.
			(laughs)

				PETER
		How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul
		Jabar?

				NICKY
		A little strange.  I can't stop thinking
		about this girl, Valerie.

				TODD
		Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss
		her?  Need a shoulder to cry on?

				JOHN
		Easy, Liberace.

				TODD
		Oh, would you grow up.

				NICKY
		We had the greatest afternoon of my life
		until Adrian made me tell her she had a
		heart-shaped ass.

				BEEFY
		Maybe you love her.  But what do I know?
		I'm baked out of my mind.

				PETER
		Me, too.  We're gonna get going.

				TODD
		You guys want to stay?  I have a futon
		in my bedroom.

				JOHN
		That's a big pass, Elton John.

				PETER
		We're going to see Ozzy play at the
		Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come,
		Nicky?

				NICKY
		No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be
		able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.

				JOHN
		Whoa, that chick must be the real deal,
		then.  Later on.

				NICKY
		See ya, fellas.

	They leave.

				BEEFY (O.S.)
		You better snap out of it soon, kid.
		Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow.
		Seven AM.  Nighty, night.

	He falls asleep and starts snoring.  We hear the SOUND of
	THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he
	exhales.

				TODD
		That is the most frightening thing I
		have ever seen.

	Nicky stands and moves to the window.  He looks out longingly
	over the sleeping city... achingly.  RACK FOCUS behind him,
	we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection.

				NICKY
		Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School
		of Design?

	EXT. PARSON'S SCHOOL OF DESIGN - NIGHT

	Nicky walks around the corner.

	SIGN READS: "Parson's School -  Student Housing"

	Nicky is standing in front of the dorm rooms.  He looks up.
	Scanning the windows, he picks up a scent.

				NICKY
			(he sniffs)
		Coconuts...

	Nicky goes to the fire escape and starts to climb.  His nose
	leads him.  He reaches the window, sniffing heavily.

	INT. DORM ROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

	A STUDENT is standing in the window draped in silks, feeling
	his nipples with his legs crossed like the guy in "Silence of
	the Lambs."  The student is startled.

				STUDENT
		Hello.

				NICKY
		You smell like coconuts.

				STUDENT
		It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."  Makes me
		feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda
		what I'm going for.  Wanna come in?

				NICKY
		No thanks.  I'm looking for a girl named
		Valerie who also smells like coconuts.

				STUDENT
		Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one
		window over.

				NICKY
		Thanks, much.  Good luck with the
		genital tucking.

				STUDENT
		I don't need luck.  I'm good.

	Nicky floats away.  A few seconds later, he floats back,
	holding up the flask.

				NICKY
		Adrian?

				STUDENT
		Andrew.

	Nicky nods and floats off.

	EXT. VALERIE'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky crouches outside her window and peers in.

	INT. VALERIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Cool music.  She is up late.  Working by candlelight on a
	fantastic design.  Something's not working.  She drapes a
	beautiful fabric over another.  She smiles at the
	combination.  She is happy being creative.  Nicky feels his
	heart swell as he watches her.

	ON NICKY

	He's so enraptured he leans forward trying to kiss her.  His
	head bumps the window.  She turns, startled.  She sees the
	beaming Nicky.

				NICKY
		Hey.

				VALERIE
		Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.

	Pause.  Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
	right in Nicky's face.

				NICKY
		Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!

	Nicky stands up and stumbles around.

				VALERIE
		What were you thinking coming here?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure, but it didn't involve
		getting blinded with poison.

	He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
	flying over the back rail.

	EXT. VALERIE'S STREET - NIGHT

	We see Nicky hurtling toward the street.  Holding his eyes.

				VALERIE
		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!

	Suddenly he stops.  Suspended above ground.  Valerie doesn't
	hear the expected thud.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky?

	He floats up, but he can't see.

				NICKY
		Valerie?

				VALERIE
		Are you dead?

				NICKY
		No.

				VALERIE
		What are you doing?

				NICKY
		I think I'm floating.

				VALERIE
		Why would you be floating?

				NICKY
		I don't know.  Maybe it's because of
		your sweet voice.

				VALERIE
		Am I supposed to not be freaked out
		right now?  Because I am.

	He's floating up.  He slows down.

				NICKY
		I can't see you but I can smell you.
		And you make me feel alive in a way I've
		never felt before.

	CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.
	The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

				STUDENT
		You got the wrong window again, man.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?

	Nicky resumes floating up.

				VALERIE
		I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.

	Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes
	still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies
	back ten feet.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Look, just because you're floating
		doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you
		giving me the finger.

				NICKY
		That wasn't me.  I was being possessed
		by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who
		call you a gross pig.

				VALERIE
		What do you mean, "possessed?"

				NICKY
		Remember when I told you my Dad was in
		Hell?

				VALERIE
		Yes...

				NICKY
		Well, that's because he's the Devil.
		And he wants to keep his throne for
		another ten-thousand years.  Which is
		fine with me, but not with my brothers,
		so they broke out of Hell, causing my
		dad...

				VALERIE
		... "The Devil?"...

				NICKY
		...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad
		very much.  So I came to Earth to save
		him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
		and I met you and...well, my dog tells
		me I just might be in love with you.

	His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is
	totally in shock but still here.

				VALERIE
		Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.

	Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		I don't know if I should believe you.

	Nicky starts to drop.

				NICKY
		You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe
		in the butterflies.

				VALERIE
		Okay, I do.  Get back up here.

	He floats up to her holding out his hand.  Nervously, she
	takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
	flying.

	EXT. MANHATTAN - SKY - NIGHT

	They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

				VALERIE
		This is amazing.

	They soar past some more buildings.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	The preacher sense something.  He looks to the sky, then
	holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can.

				PREACHER
		The hellbeast is above us.  He's
		invading our skies!  We're all gonna
		die!  We're all gonna die!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		He's kind of ruining the mood.

				NICKY
		Let me take care of that.

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky.

				PREACHER
		We're all gonna die!

	A fire hydrant cap turns and comes off.  A powerful blast of
	water shoots out and hits the preacher, KNOCKING him across
	the street into a plate glass window.

	EXT. NYC SKY - CONTINUOUS

				VALERIE
		Can we go fly over Central Park?

				NICKY
		Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the
		most beautiful thing I could possibly
		imagine.

	EXT. OVER THE HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

	They fly over it, away from NYC.

				VALERIE
		We're going to Jersey?

				NICKY
		East Rutherford.

	EXT. MEADOWLANDS - NIGHT

	They float high above the Meadowlands.  There is an outdoor
	concert going on.  OZZFEST.
	We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.  He is singing "Mr.
	Crowley."  Nicky turns to Valerie.

				NICKY
		I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live
		until he was dead.
			(he looks at her)
		Please tell me you like metal.

				VALERIE
			(sings along to song)
		"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your
		head..."

	Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

				NICKY
		My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.

	They slow dance tighter.  The music swells.  John and Peter
	look up from their seats far below.  Nicky sees them while
	he's holding her tight.  They give thumbs up.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

	Feeling great.  Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down
	the street.

	He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.  The
	KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.  Nicky gives them a
	friendly wave.

				NICKY
			(in Korean)
		Moo ya san jie bay!

	The Koreans just glare.  Nicky's confused.

	MUSIC CUE:

	A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the
	sequence.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.  Nicky
	looks back a little, unnerved.  A TAXI screeches in front of
	him.  The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their
	teacher and start chasing Nicky.

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STOOP - DAY

	A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.  He thinks about
	going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a
	candy bar instead.

	EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

	Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.  They point
	and start wheeling after him.

	EXT. HILLY STREET - DAY

	Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.

				NICKY
		What's going on here?

	But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to
	catch up.  They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a
	last second right turn into an alley.  The wheelchairs can't
	slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the
	bottom of the street.  The TOURIST on the top level look over
	the edge to see the crash.

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY

	Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up
	out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and
	thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break.

				NICKY
		Ow...what was that for?

				BUM
		Fifty million dollars.

	The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"
	And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked.

	Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
	blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running
	right at him.  He closes his eyes.

				NICKY
		Release the evil.

	Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
	insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.

	The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
	immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
	out.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the
	insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one
	exhausted Nicky.

				NICKY
		I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a
		look.

				TODD
		Been breaking all morning.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.

				DAN RATHER
		At a news conference earlier today,
		Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this
		beleaguered city its latest dose of bad
		news.  He revealed that the man who
		caused a sensation at basketball arena
		last night is no hero... he is, in fact,
		a mass murderer.

	We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's
	holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky's outraged.

				NICKY
		I didn't murder anybody

				BEEFY
		Look.  You were really high.  Things
		happen.

				NICKY
		I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is
		Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.

				BEEFY
		I think you're looking at him.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese
	press to keep him warm.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(on TV)
		This video shows what he did after he
		left the basketball arena yesterday...

	ON THE VIDEOTAPE - DAY

	Scarface shooting his AK-47.  Nicky's face has been crudely
	superimposed over his.

				GUY
			(Adrian's voice)
		My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all
		you suckers for no reason!

	CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE"

	ON TV - DAY

	The Chief shakes his head.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Difficult to watch, I know.  In response
		to this vicious crime, I am authorizing
		the largest reward in law enforcement
		history: fifty million dollars to the
		person or persons who bring this man to
		me.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky stands outraged.

				NICKY
		This is baloney!

				BEEFY
		He superimposed your head onto
		"Scarface."

				TODD
		...which is by far DePalma's best
		work...

	A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

	The pounding increases.

				NICKY
		I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't
		live here!

				PETER
		Dude, it's us.  Let us in.

	Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in.

				JOHN
		There's like a total mob scene coming
		this way.

	We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.

				NICKY
		I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.

	Todd i s looking out the window.

				TODD
		Looks like they're following a giant
		trail of bug shit.

				PETER
		What'll we do now, Beefy?

				BEEFY
		I don't know, this is a little out of my
		league.

	VOICES GROW LOUDER.

				VOICES (O.S.)
		Come on.  Let's get 'em.

				JOHN
		What would your dad do, Nicky?

				NICKY
		Good idea...kill me.

				PETER
		Dude.  Seriously?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at
		noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.

				JOHN AND PETER
			(psyched)
		Alright!

	John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
	counter.  Nicky is dazed.

				NICKY
		That just hurt a lot.

				TODD
		I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can
		I do it?

				JOHN
		Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John
	and Peter watch happily.

				TODD
		Die, Grandma, die!

	Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand
	drops back in.  He's dead.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking
	at his hand.

				LUCIFER
		Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the
		bra.

	The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
	poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we
	see his breasts flop out.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
		two hillbillies were blowing on them.

	The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The
	Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to
	what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one
	ear).

				NICKY
		Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after
		me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am
		I gonna do?

				DAD
		What are you gonna do?  Look at me,
		Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I
		got one ear...

	Dad's remaining ear falls out.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		I got no ears!  I can't hear!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky?
		Your father's got no ears!

				NICKY
		Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have
		any advice at all for me?

				DAD
		I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear
		anything!

	Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Check one-two.  Check one-two.

				DAD
		Put it back on my head.  I'm falling
		apart here.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.
			(putting ear back on Dad)
		You get your ass back up there.  You
		save your father!

	Nicky looks very upset.

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous.

				PETER
		You sure you're down with this?

				JOHN
		Little nervous.  Wanna puke.

	They approach the cops guarding the door.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		Looking for the chief.

				PETER
		We know where to find Nicky.

	COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.

	INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

	Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
	the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT
	SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		You have what I want?

				JOHN
		Sure do.  You got what we want?

				PETER
		Fifty million bones, bro.

	He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		That's half of it.  You get the rest
		when I get Nicky.

				PETER
		Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man.
		He's not human.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Really?

				JOHN
		We think he's the son of Satan.

	PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks
	over and picks them up by their throats.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra
		careful.  Now where is he?

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We
	see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND
	CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief
	bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

				BAG LADY
		Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you
		are?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(never stopping)
		Emperor of the New Hell.

	They march through onto the platform for Track 33.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky
	usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke
	comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous.

				TODD
		Where is he?  He's late.

				BEEFY
		He'll be here.  Just keep your cool,
		kid.

	They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police
	backed up by the huge police force.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		We've been ratted out.

	Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.

				TODD
		You guys.  That was so uncool.

				PETER
		We thought the son of Satan would
		understand a move like this.

	Peter and John high-five.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Okay, take these two outside.  I can
		handle this.

	The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.  The cops lead
	their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter
	alone with the chief.

				CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
		Wanna see something cool?

	The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  Then he fits
	his hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
	he searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.
	The chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of
	his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
	chief's body slumps to the ground.

				ADRIAN
		Ta-da.  So what time is my brother
		expected back?

				JOHN
		Noon...

	They look at the clock.  It's noon.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		...ish.

	Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

				PETER
		So even though you're not really the
		chief, we still get the rest of the
		cash, right bro?

				ADRIAN
		You know what you'll get?  An
		indescribably horrific torture
		administered by demons for the rest of
		eternity.

				JOHN
		But what about the cash?  Can we keep it
		or what?

				ADRIAN
		Sure, why not?

	They high five.  Adrian smiles and waits.  It is real hot
	down there.  We hear a train coming in the distance.  A fan
	circles slowly.  They all wait for him.

				LADY
			(mumbling to herself)
		Food stamps?
		They should call 'em "dude stamps."
		Cause ever time I get one, some dude
		takes it away...

	We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way
	towards them, drunk.  Adrian scowls at her.

				LADY (CONT'D)
		Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with
		me for a dollar!

				JOHN
		No thanks...but we'll take that bottle
		of booze.
			(grabs the bottle, laughs)

				LADY
		Hey...that's mine.

	Peter pushes her away.

				PETER
		Beat it, ya freak.

	John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.

				JOHN
		Schnapps...

				PETER
			(takes the bag, swigs)
		Peppermint...alright.

	Adrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is
	actually VALERIE in disguise.  She looks back, tense.  John
	offers Adrian the flask.

				JOHN
		Wanna hit?

	Hands it to him.  He takes it.

				PETER
		Drink up.  Here's to fifty million
		clams.

				ADRIAN
		To the defilement of Earth and the
		corruption of its people.

				PETER
		Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and
		let's get outta this hell-hole.

	Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just
	before it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

				ADRIAN
		It is awfully hot down here.  How do you
		manage to stay so cool?

				JOHN
		Weed lowers the body temperature.
			(stuttering)
		I read that...in, uh...er, science
		magazine.

	Adrian stares at John.  He raises the bag again.

				ADRIAN
		This liquid will probably quench my
		thirst.  Cool me off.

				PETER
		Definitely.

				JOHN
		And give you a good buzz.

				ADRIAN
		Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
		eternity.

				JOHN
		Uh.  No it won't?

	John starts to tremble a bit.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out
		and say hello...

				JOHN
		Urr...uggg...errr...

				ADRIAN
			(eyes getting red)
		I'm calling you out, brother...

	Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John
	wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.

				JOHN/NICKY
		Urrr...uggh...
			(as Nicky)
		Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

	Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next
	to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
	the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

				ADRIAN
		Hello, Cassius.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		All right.  Let me out.

				ADRIAN
		You know, New Hell really only needs one
		new Satan.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		You mother...

	Adrian hands Nicky the flask.

				ADRIAN
		But Cassius could use some company for
		the rest of eternity.  So get in the
		flask.

	He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER

	The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.
	Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy
	raises his leg.

				COP
		Oh, he's gotta pee.

	A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the
	group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.

				TODD
		Run, Beefy!  Run!

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian stares down Nicky.

				NICKY
		I won't drink.  You can't make me.

	Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over
	to him.  He grabs her by the throat.

	We hear a train coming in the distance.

				ADRIAN
		Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.
			(Nicky is scared)
		Unlike you, she won't come back from
		where she's going.

				NICKY
		Let her go.

				ADRIAN
		I hear a train coming.  Drink.

	The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky.
	Nicky raises the flash to drink.

				VALERIE
		Don't do it.

				NICKY
		I have to, Valerie.

	We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size
	archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into
	ADRIAN'S LEG.

				ADRIAN
		Ahhh!

				BEEFY
		Now that hurt the both of us.

	Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for
	her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the
	tracks.  Right into the oncoming train.

				NICKY
		Valerie!!!

	Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from
	Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky.

				ADRIAN
		See you in Hell!

	WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.

	INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.  He
	looks around.  Confused, there's no Nicky.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

	Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  He
	sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

	Nicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain
	vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

	Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
	cake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
	down to him.

	EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.  After
	a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA
	and CHRISTA.  They are doing arts and crafts sort of things
	on a glass table in front of them.  They stare at him.  Angel
	rises.

				ANGEL
		Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're
		here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I
		am so excited right now.

				CHRISTA
		So excited.

				JENNA
		She really is.

				NICKY
		That's terrific.  Now could you ladies
		point me to the Black Palace?  I should
		check in with my dad...

	Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.

				ANGEL
		I'm sorry, you're just so cute.

				JENNA
		Do you have any idea where you are right
		now?

				NICKY
		The home of eternal damnation, house of
		Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

				ANGEL
		Maybe try the opposite of that.

	The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's
	confused.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Okay, can I just ask you something?
		What do you know about your mom?

				NICKY
		My brothers told me my mother was a
		mountain goat.  Which would explain my
		chronic halitosis.

				ANGEL
			(annoyed)
		A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.

				NICKY
		My mom wasn't a goat?

				ANGEL
		Try an angel.

				NICKY
		An angel?

				ANGEL
		Unh-huh.  Which would make you half
		angel.

	Nicky is floored.

				NICKY
		Wow.  What...what did she look like?

				ANGEL
		Well, she was about six-three, only
		spoke Portuguese and had really long
		grey hair.

	The GIRLS start laughing.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.
		I'm your mom.

	Nicky is even more floored.  FLASH.  Jenna has taken a
	picture of Nicky.

				JENNA
		I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
		look on your face.

				CHRISTA
		You're gonna be so happy she did that.

				NICKY
			(stunned)
		How come you're not older?

				ANGEL
		Angels don't get any older, son.

				JENNA
		I can't believe you just called him
		"son."

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.

	They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

	Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
	by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
	Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand
	around.

				DAD
		I can't see shit.  You're all still
		here, right?

	Adrian enters.  They all cheer.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal
		in a jiffy, sir.

				DAD LIPS
		Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came
		through.

				ADRIAN
		Where's Nicky?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He came with you and Cassius, right?

				ADRIAN
		I came through that gate alone.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry, sir, false alarm.

				DAD
		Boooo.

				ADRIAN
		Somebody explain what's going on.

	Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.

				GATEKEEPER
		You'll get nothing out of me.

				ADRIAN
		Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
		lips.

	He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the
	information immediately.

				GATEKEEPER
		The only way to save your dad is for you
		and your brothers to pass through the
		gates at the same time before he
		deteriorates completely.

				ADRIAN
		How much time does Dad have before that
		happens?

	Adrian twists hard.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims
		his throne will have unimaginable power.

	Adrian throws him down.

				LUCIFER
		All boobs and no balls.

				ADRIAN
		Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't
		mind if I take a seat while I wait for
		you.

	He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

				DAD LIPS
		Ahhh!

	He pushes Lucifer out of the way.

				LUCIFER
		I don't get no respect.

				ADRIAN
		Ten thousand years.  And I never once
		got to sit here.

	He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He
	grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Wow.  And this is just a little taste of
		my power.

				DAD
		Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons,
		get him out of the chair!

	The demons approach.

				ADRIAN
		Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are
		a couple of million evil souls on Earth
		ready to be harvested.  Anyone
		interested?

	The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.

				NICKY
		Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

				CHRISTA
		No, their mother's weren't angels.

				ANGEL
		I think they were hookers or strippers
		or something really porno like...

	There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl
	Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.

				CHUBBS
		Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your
		Mambo lesson.

				ANGEL
		Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so
		sorry.  I have company.  It's my son,
		Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?

				CHUBBS
		Wow, that's terrific.

				ANGEL
		Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a
		golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
		dance instructor.

				CHUBBS
		You mambo?

				NICKY
		I don't think so.

				CHUBBS
		Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's
		all in the hips.

	Chubbs dances as he leaves.

				NICKY
		Where did you meet my father?

				ANGEL
		It was a long time ago, at some Heaven
		and Hell mixer.

				CHRISTA
		I remember that night, you had like four
		daiquiris.

				ANGEL
		Try four and a half.  At first I totally
		didn't like him.

				JENNA
		He was really conceited.

				ANGEL
		But I don't know, he was funny, he made
		me laugh, and I hate to say it but he
		had a really nice body.

				NICKY
		And that made you want to make a baby
		with him?

	The Angels laugh.

				ANGEL
		Well, I really wasn't thinking about
		making a baby at the time!

	Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I
		don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
		perv!  I'll call you back...
			(laughs)
		Oh my G-d, I will call you back,
		goodbye.
			(hangs up)
		That was my friend, Michelle, she says
		"hi."

				NICKY
		Well tell her I said "hi" back.

	Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

				ANGEL
		I'll call her later.

				CHRISTA
		You know, we saw you save your
		girlfriend's life.

				JENNA
		That was so cool.

				ANGEL
		That's why you came up to Heaven instead
		of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically
		gets you here.

				NICKY
		How did you see me?

				ANGEL
		We can see what's going on anywhere on
		Earth.  Look.

	Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
	front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a
	reflection of Earth below.

	EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT

	People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance
	stores...

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		All these good people have totally been
		led astray.

				CHRISTA (O.S.)
		Show him Central Park.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT

	People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large
	circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist
	fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then
	jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators
	exchange money.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		There's like a three day rave goin' on
		down there.  No on is going to work
		anymore.

	Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian
	on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm
	around him.

				ADRIAN
		Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to
		see all of you here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did
		Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay?

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		Let's see...

				     RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.

				DAD LIPS
		I was a good Devil, wasn't I?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were the best Devil, boss, the best
		Devil!

				GATEKEEPER
		Absolutely.

				DAD LIPS
		I tried to do some interesting stuff...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You did amazing stuff!

				GATEKEEPER
		I don't know how you came up with some
		of it.

				DAD LIPS
		Really?  That means a lot to me.

				JENNA (O.S.)
		Oh my G-d.  He looks gross.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		I can't believe I did it with him.

	She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:

	EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT

	Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX
	HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd.

				ADRIAN
		I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to
		sin with minimal prompting.

	The crowd cheers.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		You're acting as if there is no Heaven
		or Hell.

	The crowd cheers.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT

	We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on
	flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted
	harness that looks like underwear.

				ADRIAN
		Well, I have some news.

	Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.

				CARDINAL
		There is most definitely a Hell!  And
		you're all going there when you die!
		Which will happen in about fifteen
		minutes.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad
	and they get scared.
	The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
	the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.

				PREACHER
		We really are gonna die!

	This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to
	run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

				PETER
		This don't look good.

				JOHN
		Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get
		us out of this?

				TODD
		They castrated him.  He can't shoot
		arrows, he can't piss smoke.

				BEEFY
		I can't screw.
			(whimpers)
		I can't screw.

	Valerie's crying.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is shocked.

				NICKY
		Valerie's crying!

				ANGEL
		She's so nice.

				CHRISTA
		She goes to Parson's, right?

				ANGEL
		I would totally love to go there.  But I
		hear it's really hard to get in.

				NICKY
		I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I
		gotta help everybody.

				ANGEL
		Yeah, you do...

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.

				ADRIAN (V.O.)
		At the stroke of midnight, my father
		will be completely deteriorated.  And
		all of your souls will be mine.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Soon you will see things more horrible
		than you can even imagine.

	Adrian scans the crowd.  He sees...

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.  Adrian is
	thrown.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.

	Adrian motions to some of his guards.  They nod.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
		bring you a dear sweet man and an
		international icon...Henry Winkler!

	A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by
	two DEMONS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The scared bad people finally smile.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Covered in bees!

	We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm
	of bees.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The crowd gasps.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is starting to panic.

				NICKY
		But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger
		and smarter than me.

				ANGEL
		Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely.
		But you have something he doesn't have.

				NICKY
		A speech impediment?

	The girls laugh.

				ANGEL
		No, you have the inner light.  You can
		totally use it.  It's the best power of
		all.
			(he smiles)
		And in case you get in real bad trouble,
		G-d told me to give you this.

	She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.

				NICKY
		What is it?

				ANGEL
		I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d
		said when the time comes, you'll know
		what to do.

				CHRISTA
		G-d's so smart.

				JENNA
		The smartest.

				ANGEL
		Well, goodbye...for now.
			(looks at his face)
		Can I just do this?

	She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?

				FRIEND
		Totally.

				NICKY
		Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
			(to Angel)
		Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?

				ANGEL
		It would be so okay.

	Nicky hugs his Mom.

				NICKY
		Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple
		cause I'm gonna rock that town like a
		hurricane.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		You're already there...

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT

	Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see
	the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards
	him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and
	concentrates.

				NICKY
		Release...the good.

	When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around
	the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching.
	THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial
	expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the
	butterflies.

	ANGLE ON

	MORE DEMONS keep closing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the good...

	Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see
	fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting
	them.

	The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the awesome.

	...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
	POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of
	chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Put it in your mouth and let it slide
		down your throat-hole.

	The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little.

				DEMON
		Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

	The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

	Only ten minutes left.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.

				TODD
		One thing I really regret is never
		having experimented sexually.

				PETER
		You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
		Burner?  What are you talking about?

				JOHN
		He means getting it on with someone like
		that freak.

	ANGLE ON:

	The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.

	BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN

				TODD
		His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.

				JOHN
		Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT

	Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by
	butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down
	the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden
	light/haze of good around them.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is underneath Valerie.

				ADRIAN
		You know, from this angle, you're kind
		of cute.

				VALERIE
		You think so?  Why don't you come a
		little closer and I'll show you a better
		angle.

	He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  He smiles.
	Opens his mouth and catches her spit.  He swallows.

				ADRIAN
		Yummy.

	Everyone is grossed out.

				TODD
		Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
		swallowed that spit.

				BEEFY
		That turn you on there, RuPaul?

				ADRIAN
		Keep it up and I just might make you my
		Queen for a night or two.

				JOHN
		You want a queen?  Got one right here.

	John points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to
	Valerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
	He looks down to see:

	Nicky standing there with his army.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Little Nicky.

				NICKY
		Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
		name of all that is good: release my
		friends and get in the flask.

				ADRIAN
		Is this a joke?

				NICKY
		No.  It's the inner light.  And with it
		we can defeat anything you've got.

				REFORMED DEMON
			(eating Popeye's chicken)
		It's true!

	Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out
	an evil ray.

	The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His
	golden insides splatter on the crowd.

	The Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his
	chicken.

				ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
		It's not true?

	The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky
	steps forward bravely.

				NICKY
		Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no
		choice.

	Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

	 EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

				NICKY
		Love lifts me up where I belong.

	ANGLE ON

	Crowd reacts.

	ON HELL STAGE

	Demons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

				ADRIAN
		Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what
		you've got.

	Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto
	the stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little
	chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

	ON CROWD

	The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
	this.

	BACK ON HELL STAGE

	Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
	He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
	baffled chipmunk in one bite.

	Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
	flowers.

	Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
	lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

	Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
	pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

	Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
	leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

	Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf
	stops beating her up and holds her hand.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my
		bare hands.

	Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the
	platform.

	Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,
	when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

	INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS

	We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
	watching the action on the table.

				ANGEL
		I totally had to do that.

				ALL THE GIRLS
		Yah you did.

	CHUBBS is there, too.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky
	rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and
	bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
	down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds
	out the flask.

				NICKY
		Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the
		flas...

	Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
	sending him flying off the bed.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

	Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of
	awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

	Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
	to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
	lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes
	down hard.  Nicky towers over him.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Now will you get in the flask?

				ADRIAN
		Absolutely not.

	Adrian turns to his demons.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		A little help over here.

	A bunch of Demons advance.

	ON FLAGPOLE

	We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
	over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

	ON ADRIAN

	He looks up and glares at Henry.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Henry!

	ON FLAGPOLE

	Henry's eyes widen.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Oh no.

	He is covered in bees again.

	BACK ON ADRIAN

	He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
	demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
	open his mouth.

	Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
	mouth.

				ADRIAN
		Goodbye, Nicky.

	We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Come on in, bro.

	Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams
	the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
	Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
	grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

	As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

				CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna
		bust Adrian's head wide open.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		I was going to let you out, eventually,
		Cassius.  I swear.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
		heard him keep saying.

	We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

	All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
	circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down
	off the stage.

	We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd
	REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
	horrible thud.

				VALERIE
		Nicky!

				NICKY (O.S.)
		That was Cassius!

	The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People
	get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
	street.  They root for their side.

				DEMON
		Kill him, Adrian.

	John and Peter start beating up the Demon.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	The Angel and the Friend are praying.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
	the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds
	their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

	HOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
	people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
	The people and demons near him are grossed out.

	Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

				VALERIE
		Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
		fight like that?

				NICKY
		From my dad's side of the family.

	She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.
	But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for
	air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

	The crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for
	help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets
	her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

				ADRIAN
		What?  No tongue?

	Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
	into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
	around, laughing, scaring people.

	Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

				VALERIE
			(whispering)
		Nicky. Nicky.

	No response.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		You gotta fly out...I know you can do
		it.
			(still no response)
		Do it for the butterflies.

	A long beat, then:

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Butterflies...

	And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
	on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
	is one minute from midnight.

	Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
	BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
	it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

				OZZY
		Hello, New York.

				JOHN AND PETER
		Ozzy.

	They faint.

	The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
	mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
	hands Ozzy the flask.

				VALERIE
		Put him in, Ozzy.

	Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER

	The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The
	FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.
	The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are
	on their backs crying like babies.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.

				JOHN
		He'll never make it.

				PETER
		You gotta kill yourself.

				NICKY
		I'll just go to Heaven.

				BEEFY
		No if you do something bad right before
		you die.

	PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Aw, man, not again.

				NICKY
		Sorry, Henry.
			(focuses)
		Release the Evil.

	Henry is covered in bees once again.

	ON NICKY AND VALERIE

	Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Do me.

				VALERIE
		I love you.

				NICKY
		I love you.

	Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.

	ON CLOCK TOWER

	Six seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The lips and finger are slowing down.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it
	starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP
	SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.

	The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell
	now descends quickly into the ground.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

	Dad's lips form a body around it.  Dad FILLS IN.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The good people of New York cheer.  We see John, Peter, Todd,
	Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing
	seductively.

	EXT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is so proud.

				ANGEL
		Okay, you just saw my son save the
		universe.  Right?!

	Everyone cheers.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are hugging.

				DAD
		You came through, Nicky.

				NICKY
		I came through for you, Mom and the
		butterflies, Dad.

				DAD
		You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's
		no butterflies here.  If you want
		butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

				NICKY
		What about you and Grandpa and everyone
		in Hell?

				DAD
		Nicky, I let my butterflies die once
		upon a time and it's never stopped
		hurting.
			(Dad looks up)
		That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm
		still in love with you.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is shocked.

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about
		me.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

				DAD
		And don't think I forgot about how crazy
		you get after a few daiquiris.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

				FRIEND
		That guy is still a horn dog.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad turns to Nicky.

				DAD
		Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got
		up high.  You take care of the middle.

				NICKY
		I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley
		Crue, this will always be my...home
		sweet home...

	He pats him on the back.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time
		for Hitler's punishment.

				LUCIFER
		Let me handle that.

	Lucifer walks over to the closet.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		And I'm not using a pineapple this time.

	He pulls out the flask.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		No!

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Don't do it!

	He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.  Hitler's face tightens.

				HITLER
		Holy Schnit!

	FREEZE FRAME, then:

					DISSOLVE TO:

	ONE YEAR LATER

	Over the skyline of Manhattan.

	EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST

	PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and
	Valerie both pushing it.  We see Beefy walking with them.
	Unbelievably happy.

	A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.

				LADY
		Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

				VALERIE
		Thank yo.

				LADY
		Such a little angel.

				BEEFY
		Only a quarter, ma'am.

	She tickles the baby.  It giggles and a small stream of fire
	shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.

				NICKY
		Zachariah, say you're sorry.

				BABY ZACHARIAH
			(sounds like Nicky)
		Sorry.

	The Lady scurries away.  Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue
	walking in absolute bliss.  They pass the Preacher who runs
	towards us.

				PREACHER
		He has spilled his seed!  He is
		multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the
		unholy union!  We're all gonna die!

	The Preacher runs straight into the camera.  BLACK.

					    THE END.
FADE IN:

	EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT

	A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers
	sprinkling.

	We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,
	where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He
	has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly
	the lights turn on.

				PEEPER
			(whispering)
		Showtime!

	We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's
	window.  She is wearing business attire.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?
			(takes bite of sandwich)
		Well you'll feel better once you slip
		off those work clothes and get into some
		sweats.

	The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing
	her feet.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me
		rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't
		use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...

	He sips some wine.

	The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,
	revealing a nice bra.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Looks like Victoria just told me her
		secret.

	The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing
	the words as he goes.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,
		first brassiere sighting...
			(stops writing)
		I will pleasure myself to this image for
		months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!

	The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks
	in wearing a scouts uniform.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What
		unfortunate timing.  You mother was just
		getting comfy.

	The son talks to his mother excitedly.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great
		knots today or whatever.  Now get out.

	The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Now what.  This simply won't do.

	The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son
	answers.

				SCOTTIE
		Hello?

				PEEPER
		Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go
		downstairs like a good boy and let your
		mother freshen up.

				SCOTTIE
		Who is this?

				PEEPER
		Just a little birdie.  A birdie who
		wants to see if your mother's panties
		match her bra.

				MOTHER
		Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up
		our tree?

	The peeper gets nervous.

				PEEPER
		Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big
		bird.

	The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.
	We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He
	shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls
	to the ground with a thud.

				PEEPER (CONT'D)
		Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And
		wear your bikini.

	The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television
	out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.

					   HARD CUT:

	INT. HOLE - DAY

	The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on
	all sides.

	The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way
	screaming like a five-year old girl.

	PEEPER'S POV

	We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the
	peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He
	SCREAMS.

	EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL

	We see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!
	We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in
	a heap in a shallow pit of coals.

	Dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the
	fire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals
	clothes are now burned & shredded).

				GATEKEEPER (O.S.)
		Welcome!

	The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his
	station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.

				PEEPER
		Am I in hell?

				GATEKEEPER
		What do you think?

	A GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We
	leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

	MATTE PAINTING HELL

	MUSIC UP: "RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL" BY VAN HALEN

	The VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it
	like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see
	the black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the
	castle, to one particular window.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY

	Looks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,
	heavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no
	bed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the
	song.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled
	"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX."

	The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring
	NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.

				NICKY
			(embarrassed)
		Hey...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your father wants to see you and your
		brothers in the throne room.

				NICKY
		Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is
		rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

	INT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

	ADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for
	people's faces that are coming through the wall.

				CASSIUS
		I knew it.  He's finally retiring.

				ADRIAN
		I've been waiting on this day for ten
		thousand years.

	He throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaah!

				CASSIUS
		If the old man picks me to take over
		Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty
		four seven.  No breaks.

				ADRIAN
		Well Dad says it's the breaks that make
		the torture.  You have to let people
		feel a sense of relief.

	Cassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS
	in the eye.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

				ADRIAN
		Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring
		is what he says doesn't matter anymore.

	Cassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.

				CASSIUS
		I'll take that.

	Cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!
	It splatters like a grape.

				HUMAN DARTBOARD
		Was that really necessary?

	Nicky enters sheepishly.

				CASSIUS
		Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing
		today?

				NICKY
		Good, thanks.

	Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.

				CASSIUS
		Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?

	Cassius' eyes start glowing red.

				NICKY
		Actually, I'll take a rain check on0

	Nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible
	force.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!

				NICKY
			(picking up his head)
		Yes, you got me...

	Nicky's head slams back down again.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya, again!

				NICKY
			(picking head up)
		Got me for sure, yes...

	He grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the
	head.

				CASSIUS
		Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...

	Nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his
	own crotch.

				NICKY
		Oh no.  Please Cassius...

	Nicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer
	until it latches on to Nicky's crotch.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Aaaaah.

	Cassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own
	hand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't
	notice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small
	devil horns), enters behind them.

				DAD
		What are you boys doing?

	Cassius releases Nicky's hand.

				NICKY
		Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the
		furniture.

				DAD
		Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out
		of your brother's mind?

				CASSIUS
		I forgot.

				DAD
		Maybe this will help you remember.

	Dad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the
	nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the
	floor.

	Dad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of
	confidence and power.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		Now everybody sit down.

				NICKY
		Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying
		down my monsters of metal compilation
		tape.  I really think it's a
		masterpiece.

				DAD
		Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

	He leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the
	window the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his
	head.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad
	closes the curtains.

	Nicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of
	his throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip
	of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at
	his three sons.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was
		thrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules
		here in hell for ten thousand years.
		And after this ten thousand years had
		passed, he decided to abdicate his
		throne...

	Confused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		...to step aside.
			(Nicky lowers his hand)
		...and let me become the ruler of hell.
		This, as some of you might know, is my
		ten thousandth year as Prince of
		Darkness.  So I think the time has come
		to discuss who will succeed me.

	Jimmy the Demon walks in.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Knock, knock.

				DAD
		Yes, Jimmy.

	He whispers in Dad's ear.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		No, no, that's not what I said.  He can
		keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta
		go.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
			(turning to leave)
		Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a
		pineapple up Hitler's ass at four
		o'clock.

	Dad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention
	back to his sons.

				DAD
		This was a very difficult decision,
		because I have three wonderful sons.  I
		mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.
		And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And
		Nicky, so...so...

				NICKY
		Don't worry about coming up with
		anything.  It's cool.

				DAD
		Such a sweet boy.  But after much
		thought and careful consideration, I've
		decided that the ruler for the next ten
		thousand years is going to have to
		be...me.

				CASSIUS AND ADRIAN
			(dumbfounded)
		What!?

				NICKY
		Hallelujah.

	They all look at Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I mean...tough break.

				DAD
		The important thing for the stability of
		our rule is to maintain the balance
		between good and evil.  And I don't
		think any of you are ready for that
		responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom
		that comes only with the passage of
		time.

				CASSIUS
		Dad!  This is Hoyashit.

	Dad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human
	Dartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the
	tongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.

				DAD
		Right.  Right.  Send him in.
			(to the boys)
		I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back
		to work.

	Nicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.

				ADRIAN
		You sure about this decision, Dad?

				DAD
		I'm telling you, pal, it's the right
		thing to do.

	HITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by
	Jimmy.  They head towards the closet.

	Inside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out
	a relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head "no."  Dad walks
	over to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.
	Dad nods "yes."  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends
	Hitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...

	CLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES

	As the pineapple's jammed up his ass.

				HITLER
		Holy schnit!!

	EXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY

	Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing
	with souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot
	looking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.

				CASSIUS
		You work your ass off for ten thousand
		years, hurting people, helping others
		hurt people, then you get a decision
		like that.

				ADRIAN
		And he's dead serious.

				CASSIUS
		It's just such a slap in the face.

	Adrian turns to the Monster.

				ADRIAN
		Um, excuse me, we're having a private
		conversation here.

				CASSIUS
		Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!

	Cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.
	The Monster shrugs and walks off.

				ADRIAN
		Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa
		Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in
		hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm
		getting tired of serving in Hell.  We
		need a place where we can rule.

	Cassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns
	around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.
	Cassius sees this and gets enraged.

				CASSIUS
		Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it
		on!! Let's see what you got!

	The Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in
	an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.

				CASSIUS (CONT'D)
		That's what I thought!

				ADRIAN
			(to Cassius)
		Could you concentrate for five seconds?

				CASSIUS
		I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?

				ADRIAN
		What do you think about...Earth?

	Cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		We could create our own hell there.

				CASSIUS
		You saying we go up there and kill
		everyone?

				ADRIAN
		Eventually, Cassius.  But first we
		corrupt as many as we can so that when
		we do destroy them...

				CASSIUS
		...their damned souls will be ours.

				ADRIAN
		It's our time, brother.

	The two look at each other.  They start running toward the
	fire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey, what are you doing?!?

	They get closer to the fire.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You can't go through there.  The fire
		flows in, not out.

	They dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		You know something?  You guys suck!  You
		really suck!

	Sirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we
	hear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the
	firewall hard.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix
	tapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb."
	Pause.  Dad exhales.

				DAD
		Now that was an experience.  "You are
		only coming through in waves."  That
		line blows my mind every time.

				NICKY
		Definitely.

				DAD
		I don't care what kind of mood you're in
		at the start of that song.  When it's
		over, that mood has been altered.  Wow.
		Great shit.  What's next?

				NICKY
		Well, I thought that after messing with
		your head, I'd give you a little kick in
		the keester.

	Hits the tape player.  "Enter Sandman" blasts.

				DAD
		Who is this, Metal-lick-a?

				NICKY
		Metallica, Dad.  Come on.

				DAD
		I was just playing with you.

	Dad and Nicky dance to the song.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	CLOSE ON DAD.

				DAD
		I'm sorry.  After careful consideration,
		I regretfully have to decline.

	ON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.

				DAN
		C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one
		Superbowl ring.

				DAD
		In exchange for eternal damnation of
		your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for
		me to want to do that to you, Mr.
		Marino.

				DAN
		You did it for Namath.

				DAD
		Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.
		Just go back to Earth and enjoy your
		records and the Hall of Fame and the
		beautiful family and all that.

				DAN
		This is bullshit, man.
			(gets up to leave)
		I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,
		with or without you!

				DAD
		Now you're talking.

	Dan exits.

				NICKY
		You're a good devil, Dad.

				DAD
		And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

	Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint
	sirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his
	knees.

				GATEKEEPER
		Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
		escaped from hell.  They went through
		the fire, and they broke it.  I think
		they took the New York tunnel.  I tried
		to stop them, but they overpowered me,
		sir.

				DAD
		Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off
		your knees.

	The Gatekeeper stands up.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks for being so understanding, your
		worship.  You're the man.  You've always
		been the man.

	Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge
	boobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We
	only see them from the front for a second.
	From behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the
	nipples as he talks to Nicky.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
			(to Nicky)
		I'm lucky to get away with just the head
		boobs, right?

				NICKY
		Coulda been much worse.

				GATEKEEPER
		That's what I'm thinkin'...

	Dad is staring off.  He looks shaken.

				DAD
		This is bad, Nicky.

				NICKY
		How bad?

				DAD
		I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are
		broken, no new souls can get in, which
		means I'll start to deteriorate into
		nothing.

	GRANDPA LUCIFER enters.

				LUCIFER
		What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?

				DAD
		Everything's fine, pop.

				LUCIFER
		Last time you said that the renaissance
		happened.

				DAD
		Please, pop, just go back to your room.

				LUCIFER
			(regarding gateskeeper)
		Can I take him with me and have sex with
		his head?

				DAD
		Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.

	The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer.

				GATEKEEPER
		Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
		lifestyle for me, isn't it.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER

	We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED
	SOULS in hell are sneaking off.

	The DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.

	Dad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.

				DAMNED SOULS (O.S.)
		What's going on?  Where are we?

	We keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud
	thuds.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Nothing's getting through that.  The
		fire is solid as a rock.

				NICKY
		We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
		Ideas?

				DAD
		To do that Cassius and Adrian have to
		come back through the other way.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Dad!

				DAD
		I'm too weak.  The process has already
		begun.

	Dad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We
	see the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.

				NICKY
		So go get 'em, Jimmy!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		I'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got
		devil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes
		up there with your brothers.

				NICKY
		You're not saying it's up to me?

	The MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as
	if to say, "oh no."

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I've never been to Earth.  I've never
		even slept over at some other dude's
		house!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You're the spawn of Satan.  You got it
		in you.

				DAD
		Nicky, the worst thing that could happen
		on Earth is you get killed, in which
		case, boom, you end up back here.

				NICKY
		Are you telling me I have to go to Earth
		and kill my brothers?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Not go.  They left together at the exact
		same time.  They gotta come back
		together at the exact same time.

	Dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.

				DAD
		Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One
		sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once
		you've got both of them, you bring the
		flask back through the gate.

	Dad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.
	The Monster gags.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Your ol' man's got less than a week.

	Nicky looks petrified.

				NICKY
		No.  This can't be happening.

				DAD
		Son, just do your best.

	Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,
	who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.

	Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster
	taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get
	a move on."

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL

	PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between
	two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the
	surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near
	distance.

				NICKY
		Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This
		doesn't look too bad.

	Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and
	WHAMMM!

			EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in
	the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were gone ten seconds.  What
		happened?

				NICKY
		I got hit by a big light that was
		attached to a lot of metal.

				DAD
		That's a train, son.  Don't stand in
		front of them.

				NICKY
		Well, I guess I'm going to have to take
		a mulligan on this one.

				DAD
		Please, Nicky, get back up there.
			(his ear falls off)
		Try to hurry.

	Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and
	hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is
	stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.
	In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to
	identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is
	scrawled "NICKY."

	Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat.

				NICKY
		I'm Nicky.

	Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.

				BEEFY
			(voice of Sandy Wernick)
		Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track
		and come with me, shitstains.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY

	The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal
	are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking
	around suspiciously, talking to the dog.

				BEEFY
		My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of
		your father's.  He's asked me to help
		you out.

				NICKY
		I just need to find my brothers and be
		on my way, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers
		can possess people.  So they probably
		won't look like themselves.  You have to
		be suspicious of everyone.

	Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat.

				NICKY
		Okay, "bro," this jig is up...
			(pulling out the flask)
		Just get in the bottle.  Just slide
		right on in there.

				BEEFY
		It's not me, moron.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry.

	EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put
	money in his pot.

				PREACHER
		Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his
		children.
			(passerby puts in money)
		He thanks you for your kindness.
			(another woman puts in money)
		God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you...
		The Lord loves you...

	We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER
	sniffs.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		The Lord does not love you.  I
		sense...pure evil.
			(thrusts his cross in Nicky's
		   face)
		You make the Lord very nervous.
			(feeling hot)
		I'm burning...ahhh.
			(running away)
		The Devil walks among us!

	He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people.

				PREACHER (CONT'D)
		Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast!

	He gets off course and runs right into a subway entrance.  He
	disappears.  Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Makin' friends already.

				NICKY
			(shivering a little)
		It's freezing up here, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have
		the same physical needs and limitations
		a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get
		you some warm clothes.

				NICKY
		I also have this odd pain in my mid
		section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...

				BEEFY
		That pain is hunger.

	EXT. BENCH - DAY

	K-mart bag is next to a bench.  PAN UP to see Nicky wearing
	an extra warm SKI OUTFIT.  Sitting next to him on the bench
	is Beefy.  Between them is a big bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED
	CHICKEN.  Nicky takes out a drumstick.

				NICKY
		So far, so good.  Now what?

				BEEFY
		Put it in your mouth.

	Nicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Move your teeth up and down.

	Nicky does.  He chews for a long time.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Now you gotta swallow it.  Tilt your
		head back and let the meat slide down
		your throat-hole.

	Nicky does.  He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.

				NICKY
		Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

				BEEFY
		It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're
		gonna need your energy.

				NICKY
		I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's
		get cracking!

	NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right
	into the path of a moving bus.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	The Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The
	gatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be
	enjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on
	the ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)

	The Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.  Kind of
	embarrassed.

				GATEKEEPER
		Hey.

				NICKY
		That's a pretty brassiere.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thanks.

				NICKY
		Could you maybe not tell anyone about
		this?

				GATEKEEPER
		You got it.  Could you maybe not tell
		anyone about this?

				NICKY
		You got it.

	Nicky turns and walks toward the firewall.  As soon as his
	back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I
	love your boobs."  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh
	(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

	Beefy is walking with him down the street.  Nicky is crazy
	cautious.

				NICKY
		From now on.  I'm just going to avoid
		all moving metal objects.

				BEEFY
		Great.  Now your father gave me some
		deposit money for a nice pad on the
		Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

	Beefy is sitting on a bench/booth at a strip club.  Champagne
	is on the table.  Bills in his mouth.  We see THREE DANCERS
	dancing for him.

				  FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. VILLAGE STREET

	Nicky and Beefy.

				BEEFY
		So I found this other joint for you.
		But you're gonna have a roommate.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the
	phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village.

				TODD
			(on phone)
		I know exactly how you feel... The night
		Reagan was elected, I said to my mother,
		"Is this man going to blow up the world,
		Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an
		hour.
			(knock at the door)
		Somebody's here.  Call you later.

	Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by
	his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.

				NICKY
		Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I
		understand you're seeking a roommate, as
		per your advertisement in the Village
		Voice.  Would it be possible for me to
		fill the slot?

				TODD
		Uh, don't you want to know what the rent
		is?

	Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both
	nod imperceptibly.

				NICKY
		Yes.  What is rent?

				TODD
		Eight-hundred, split down the middle.
		Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with
		my scene partner so the living room will
		be off limits.

				NICKY
		Off limits.

				TODD
		Right.  And as far as household items:
		we can share the soap, but we'll split
		the cost 60/40.
		Cause the person who physically goes out
		and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay
		as much as the other guy.
			(looks at Nicky)
		Aren't you boiling in that outfit?

				NICKY
		No.

				TODD
		It's like eighty degrees in this
		hallway.  You from the South?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  The deep South.

	Nicky laughs a little too hard.

				TODD
		Why is that funny?

				NICKY
		I don't know.

				TODD
		And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

	Todd turns and goes into the apartment.

				BEEFY
		You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day
		tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep
		thing I told you about.

				NICKY
		Got ya.
			(to Todd)
		Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

				TODD
		Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.

	The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It
	reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over
	it.

	INT. NICKY'S ROOM

	Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully
	clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that
	familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we
	hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices.

	SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,
	looking concerned.

	EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING

	We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a
	large church.

	INT. CATHEDRAL

	CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the
	steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.
	We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He
	gins his homily.

				CARDINAL
		In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who
		we are to live if we wish to attain the
		splendor of Heaven... or something like
		that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in
		the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.
		Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.

	The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is
	standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box
	with the top open.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
		hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really
		done anything for us?  Has he ever put a
		Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever
		given any of my enemies the herpes?  No.
		He hasn't done a damn thing for any of
		us.

	A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.

				MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
		The Lord gave my son the strength to get
		off drugs.

				CARDINAL
		Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me,
		he was better off on drugs.  He's a
		bore.  At least when he was smoking
		hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.

	A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up.

				YOUNG MAN
		After we tried for many years, the Lord
		finally helped my wife conceive a baby.

				CARDINAL
		No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
		wife conceive a baby.  He helped her
		conceive it all night long.

	Fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts
	to "raise the roof."  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal
	points to a well-dressed man in the front pew.

				CARDINAL (CONT'D)
		How about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever
		do anything for you?

	The Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.

				MAYOR
			(standing)
		Well, I wish I could think of something,
		Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I
		can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if
		there even is a Lord.  If there is any
		ultimate punishment for our so-called
		"sins."  Maybe we should all just have
		fun and do whatever the hell we want.

	A hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof
	again, this time energetically.

				CARDINAL
		Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!

	The hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting
	over the money in the collection plate.

	The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the
	Cardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Oh, this is delicious.

	ON MAYOR

	He's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
			(laughing)
		"Let the sin begins" - that was a good
		one.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Well, we must get people sinning if we
		want to fill up our New Hell.  How are
		things going down at City Hall?

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		I lowered the drinking age to ten.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Brilliant.  This is so much fun.  I
		never want it to end.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Why should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?

	The Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.  PAN OVER TO:

	Nicky, his pants around his ankles.  He's trying to do the
	same.

				NICKY
		This is intense!  And it happens every
		day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my
		hat to you people!

				BEEFY
		Look, it's okay for me to shit the
		street.  But you gotta use a toilet.

				NICKY
			(pulling up pants)
		Okay, just point me in the right
		direction next time.

				BEEFY
		Come on, there's like ten million people
		in this city and the clock is ticking.

				NICKY
		Well, let's rock and roll.

	Nicky looks at the next person walking by.  It's a CHINESE
	DELIVERY GUY on a bicycle.  Nicky clotheslines him, taking
	him off the bike in a sleeperhold/headlock.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Get in the bottle.  Dad's falling apart.
		You froze the gate and you're killing
		him.  Drink!

	Nicky puts the flask to the Chinese Guy's lips.

				CHINESE DELIVERY GUY
		I'm not thirsty!  I'm not thirsty!

				NICKY
		just get in the flask!

	The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick
	to the head and runs away.  Nicky gets up.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Adrian and Cassius!  You think a kick to
		the head is gonna make me throw in the
		towel?  Well, in the immortal words of
		Judas Priest, "You got another thing
		comin'."

	Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the
	bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	Nicky approaches various people as they pass.  (To be shot
	long lense, real people, real reactions.)

	INT. POPEYE'S - DAY

	Nicky gets to the front of the line and tries to get the
	Cashier to drink.  The Cashier yanks his head away and gives
	Nicky a dirty look.  Nicky shrugs and points to the menu,
	ordering some chicken.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in
	his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes
	it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries
	to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he
	grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at
	Nicky as he walks away.

	INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

	Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the
	polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the
	flask.

	INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER

	Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again.
	The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs.

				GATEKEEPER
		Bus?

				NICKY
		Beast.

	The Monster laughs.

				GATEKEEPER
			(to Monster)
		You like that?  You think that's funny?

	The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels.

				GATEKEEPER (CONT'D)
		How about that?  You like that?

	The Monster howls with delight.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a
	Popeye's drumstick.

				NICKY
		All that running and chasing is making
		the sleep thing want to come early.

				BEEFY
		I think we have to work on narrowing
		down our list of suspects.  Now I'm
		going to go check in with some of my
		contacts uptown.

	Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep.
	Beefy sighs.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just
		begging to come out...

	Beefy walks away.

	EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY

	Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky
	snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores.

	ON WORRIED PEOPLE

	Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL
	GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a
	goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down:
	it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore.

				PETER
		Sounds like our devil dance actually
		worked this time.

				JOHN
		'Bout time...

	Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The
	worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the
	Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores.

	Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		There's our man.

				PETER
		Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties
		to the dark side.

	A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes
	the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket.

				JOHN
		What's with that guy?

				PETER
		Gotta be one of his disciples or
		something.

	Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten
	drumstick) and runs off.

				JOHN
		Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
		ripped off.

				PETER
		Should we wake him up?

				JOHN
		Yeah.  You do it.

	Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud
	SNORT.

				PETER
		Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude
		just stole your shit.

	Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone.

				NICKY
		Oh nooooo....

	Fire shoots out of Nicky's mouth.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Which way did he go?

				JOHN
		That way.

	Nicky is about to run off.  Looks at John's shirt.

				NICKY
		Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
		phenomenal.

	He runs off.

				PETER
		Did you check out the dragon mouth?

				JOHN
		The Dark Prince is here.

	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

	Nicky is searching the street for his flask.  He walks past
	several STREET VENDORS who have set up their wares on the
	sidewalk.  PAUSE.  Nicky comes walking back into frame as he
	sees his flask (and half-eaten drumstick) laying on the
	blanket of the VENDOR.

				NICKY
		Hey...

				STREET VENDOR
		See something you like, my man?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I would like my flask back.

	The street vendor stands, very angry.

				STREET VENDOR
		You callin' me a thief, my man?

				NICKY
		No, I'm just calling you... a guy who
		has my flask.

				STREET VENDOR
		And if that is your so-called "flask,"
		how would I have it unless I was, in
		fact, a thief?

				NICKY
			(not sure what the answer is)
		I don't know?

	A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask.

				MAN
		Yeah, how much for the silver flask
		there?

				STREET VENDOR
		Well, that's a very special item.  The
		cap itself is one hundred percent
		plappium.  It's a value is over three
		thousand dollars.

				MAN
		Really.  Where's it from?

				NICKY
		It was handcrafted in hell by Satan
		himself and is only to be used for the
		capture and containment of my blood
		brothers so that the firefall of Hades
		will burn brightly once again.

				MAN
		Really.  I think we'll let you keep it
		then.

	He walks away.

				STREET VENDOR
		Okay, now you gone and done it.  You
		done messed with my business bitch!

				NICKY
		Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise
		your voice.  It's making my muscles
		tighten.

	We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.

				STREET VENDOR
		Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me?
		I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's
		get busy.

	The vendor makes an even crazier face at Nicky and starts
	swinging his fists around.

	Nearby, VALERIE, an unsure, sweetly unstylish young woman, is
	selling clothes off a spread out blanket.  She notices what's
	going on.

	Nicky's eyes widen in panic.  Just then, Valerie steps in.

				VALERIE
		Excuse me, does that flask belong to
		this man?

				STREET VENDOR
			(frustrated)
		Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.

				VALERIE
		Look, I know you come out here and sell
		stolen stuff all the time.  But today,
		the guy you stole from just happened to
		walk by and bust you.  So why don't you
		admit today's not your day and give him
		his flask back?

				STREET VENDOR
		Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly
		me to death?

				VALERIE
		No, but maybe that cop over there might
		have something to say.

	Valerie points to a cop across the street.  The Street Vendor
	ponders this for a second, then...

				STREET VENDOR
		Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
			(looking at Valerie)
		And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes
		and find a new corner.  Before I show
		you what real crazy is.

	The vendor does crazy eyes again.

				VALERIE
		Fine.  I will.

	Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick.

				NICKY
		Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a
		few years.

	Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky
	follows her.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You
		didn't have to do that.

				VALERIE
		That's okay.  I get messed with all the
		time and when I saw him doing that to
		you I just lost it.  I hate when people
		take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it
		for the rest of us.

				NICKY
		You think I'm a tourist?

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent
		maybe.  Where are you from?

				NICKY
		The South.

				VALERIE
		Really?

				NICKY
		Yeah.  Deep south.
			(laughs hard)

	She laughs along with him, not sure why.

				VALERIE
		Why are you laughing?

				NICKY
		I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your
		glasses are nice.  They make your eyes
		look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look
		at them.

				VALERIE
		My dad's an optometrist.

				NICKY
		My dad's in hell, and he's falling
		apart.

				VALERIE
		I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your
		parents get older.

				NICKY
		If I don't save him, I don't know what
		I'm gonna do.

				VALERIE
		Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like
		you will figure something out.

	Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He
	hands her the half-eaten drumstick.

				NICKY
		Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick
		ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.

				VALERIE
		That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I
		actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.

				NICKY
		Could I come with you to getting a
		Gelati?

				VALERIE
		If you want to.

				NICKY
		Want to?  A million angry octopus people
		couldn't hold me back!

				VALERIE
		"Octopus people?"

				NICKY
		Uh, it's a deep south expression.

	Nicky laughs.

	EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

	They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati.

				NICKY
		It's freezing my hands.

				VALERIE
		It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap
		it.

	Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just
	then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head,
	sensing Nicky.

				PREACHER
		Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
		Your evil is stinking up our streets!
		We're all gonna die!

	He takes off running right into a lamp post.

				VALERIE
		This town is really going to hell
		lately.
			(Nicky nods)
		So what part of the city do you live in?

				NICKY
		I have an apartment.  I don't remember
		exactly where.  My dog knows, though.

				VALERIE
			(laughs)
		You have a dog?  What kind?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's
		uptown talking to his contacts.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

	Beefy is screwing a female dog from behind.

				BEEFY
		Remember, it's not the size of the boat,
		it's the motion of the ocean.

				GIRL DOG
		Just finish.

	EXT. STREET - VALERIE & NICKY CONTINUOUS - DAY

				VALERIE
		I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to
		school full time.  It wouldn't be fair
		to the dog.

				NICKY
		School?

				VALERIE
		Parsons School of Design.  I knew
		growing up I wasn't much to look at, so
		I put my energy into making things that
		are pretty.

				NICKY
		What's that pleasant smell coming from,
		your skin?

				VALERIE
		My perfume?

	He takes her wrist to his nose.  He stares at it, licks it.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
			(laughs)
		It's called "Comptoir Sud Pacific."
		Which I think is the French word for
		coconuts.

	Nicky stops and looks at her.

				NICKY
		Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch
		of butterflies flapping around in my
		stomach.  Is that normal?

				VALERIE
		Sometimes, sure.

				NICKY
		Good.  I was concerned.

	EXT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	The Gatekeeper is near the frozen fall.  We hear loud
	wailing, moaning, etc., coming from the other side.

				GATEKEEPER
		Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I
		hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.

	The Monster is smoking a cigarette and wearing a leather
	biker's hat.  He nods along in agreement.

	PAN TO LUCIFER

	Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of
	fire/pond.

				LUCIFER
		You know, I was the one who created
		Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		I know, your wickedness.

				LUCIFER
		I started slow, though.  For years, I
		was just giving people hot foots.
		Actually, you can give all the credit
		for Hell to my first wife; she was the
		inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too.
		One day, she asked me if I wanted super
		sex.  I said I'll take the soup.

	The Monster laughs really hard.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Take it easy there, Chewbacca.  In fact,
		you look like her mother, except she had
		more hair.

	The Monster laughs even harder.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		You know what was in Hell when I came
		down here, Cassius?

				GATEKEEPER
		It's Stanley, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles.
		Looked like a giant parking lot.  It
		wasn't even called Hell.

				GATEKEEPER
		What was it called, sir.

				LUCIFER
		Boogerland!

				GATEKEEPER
		That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you
		just enjoy the fishing?

				LUCIFER
		I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing.
		I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I
		catch everything...

	We hear the Monster laughing again as we PAN DOWN Grandpa's
	fishing line to:

	EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

	We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A
	giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head
	is sticking out.

				PEEPER
		I deserve this!

	EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY

	Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk.

				KID
		I just stole twenty-five bucks off the
		bar.

				KID #2
		How many beers did you have?

				KID # 3
		Eight sips.

				KID
		I had five!  I'm so wasted.

	They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN
	sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle
	of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.

				ADRIAN
		When an adult goes to Hell, that's
		terrific.  But when a child goes...
		that's why I'm in this business.

	Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with
	Valerie.  He's shocked.

	Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her
	collection.

				NICKY
		So you're saying, make all pants with a
		drawstring, then heavier set gals don't
		have to feel humiliated by telling their
		waist size in front of the whole store?

				VALERIE
		Basically, yeah.

				NICKY
		Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring
		socks for gals with fat ankles.

	Valerie laughs.

				VALERIE
		You know what's nice about you?  You
		just seem happy being yourself.  You
		don't try to act cool.

				NICKY
		Thanks much.  You know what's nice about
		you, Valerie?

				VALERIE
		What?

	Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's
	been stunned by something.

				NICKY
		Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.

				VALERIE
		What was that?

				NICKY
			(shocked and confused)
		I...I don't know why I just said that.
		I meant to say that...

					 QUICK CUT TO:

	Adrian's eyes flashing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		...I've always wanted to have sex with a
		gross pig.  What do you say we go behind
		that dumpster, pull our pants down and
		see what happens?

	Valerie's very hurt.

				VALERIE
		You're a jerk.

	She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian.
	His inner voice speaks to him.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		ADRIAN!

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		You shouldn't have come here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Please, get out of my mind!

	Adrian's eyes flash.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Valerie!

	She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist
	Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up,
	giving her the "finger."

				VALERIE
		What the hell's your problem?

	She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still
	across the street.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
		Dad's sick.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He's sick?

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Yeah, he needs souls to live.  When you
		guys left, you broke the gates.  We
		gotta get the gates burning again before
		he dies.

	Adrian processes this.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		He should have thought of that before he
		denied me my birthright.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Well maybe you should go back and talk
		it over with him.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		How about this?  I stay here enjoying my
		Schnapps and you go back.

	Nicky's body jerks around.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Adrian, please...

	Nicky, fighting control over his body, walks slowly and
	crazily into the middle of the street where he sees a large
	truck bearing down on him.

	JOHN and PETER get blood splattered on them.  Peter looks
	down to see the "666" forms in blood on their clothes.

				PETER
		Check this out.  The number of the
		beast.

	They laugh and hi-five.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	up religious figure that appeared earlier in the script.)

				DAN RATHER

		Oh, that's terrible, Reege...

				REGIS
		So I followed him...

				KATHY LEE
		You followed him?

				REGIS
		I followed him all the way downtown, and
		when he gets out of the car, I reach
		under my seat and pull out an aluminum
		bat.

				KATHY LEE
		You keep a bat under your seat?

				REGIS
		Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this
		guy, and start bashing his brains in
		with this bat, and it made me feel
		happy!  Did you ever see THE
		UNTOUCHABLES?

				KATHY LEE
		Yes, great movie...

				REGIS
		I was DeNiro!

	The blue haired lady AUDIENCE is crying.  The TV turns off.
	We PULL BACK to see that we are in.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy turns to Nicky.

				BEEFY
		Your brothers are upsetting the balance
		of good and evil.

				NICKY
		What can I do about it?

				BEEFY
		You can't do jack shit... unless you
		learn your evil powers.

				NICKY
		Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those
		dudes put the wick in wicked.

				BEEFY
		Go get a soda out of the fridge.

				NICKY
		But those are my roommate's sodas...

				BEEFY
			(high-pitched mocking)
		"But those are my roommate's sodas..."
		Does that sound like a statement the son
		of the devil would make?

	Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it
	on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare
	at the Coke.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		You have the power to change the cola in
		that can into any other liquid - engine
		oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just
		have to release the evil within you.

				NICKY
		Release the evil?

				BEEFY
		I'm just saying, there's wickedness in
		you... I can tell from your snores.

	Nicky stares at the can.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		Release your evil...

	Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little.

				TODD
		What are you doing?

	Todd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire
	escape.

				TODD (CONT'D)

	The TV clicks on.  We see TODD sit down and look at the TV.
	Nicky's behind him.

	ON TV

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

				BILL WALTON
		What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse
		85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal
		run circles around the 0-85 Nationals,
		seem to be struggling to find their
		groove in front of their hometown fans.

	A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who
	makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE
	GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and
	makes the travelling signal.

				REF
		He's walking, get him a bus!

				BILL WALTON
		Oh, another awful call.  There is no way
		that was travelling.

	Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face.

				CORNROWS
		What's with all these crazy calls?  You
		gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a
		game in 53 years.

				REF
		Technical foul!

	Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY
		That guy in the striped shirt snaps his
		fingers like someone I know...

	ON TV

	The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously
	slam their heads on the scorers table again and again.

	ON TODD AND NICKY

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		It looks like the work of a brother...

				TODD
		A black guy?

				NICKY
		If it's Cassius, yes.

	Nicky races for the door.

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY

	As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's
	shirt yells out.

				GLOBETROTTER FAN
		Get your head out your ass, ref!  The
		kids came to see the Globetrotters win.

				REF
		Oh, so you wanna lip off to me?
		Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth
		in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten
		points off for the Globetrotters.

	The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36.

	ON STANDS

	The KIDS are crying.

	ON COURT

	The halftime buzzer sounds.  The Globetrotters walk off the
	court.  The crowd BOOS.

				BILL WALTON
		In all my years of basketball, I was
		never so happy to hear a halftime
		buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second
		half doesn't get any better, I expect a
		full scale riot.

	A spotlight points to an announcer at mid-court.

				COURT ANNOUNCER
		It's time for the Globetrotter's
		halftime half-court heave throw, where
		one lucky fan will have a shot at ten
		thousand dollars!

	A brick lands at the announcer's feet.

		And if he makes it, everyone in

		What's Nicky doing down there?

		Trying to capture his brother in a flask
		and preserve the balance of good and

	Todd looks over, suspicious.

		Did you just talk?

				BEEFY
		No.

	INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - CONTINUOUS

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Okay, too much evil..

	Bill Walton's hair is on fire.

				BILL WALTON
		I think that ball just blew up.  And
		yes, my hair is aflame.

				NICKY
			(turning to sideline)
		Could I get another ball?

	The court announcer throws out another ball.  Nicky stares at
	it again with red eyes.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		I command you not to blow up and go into
		that metal circle.

	Nicky throws an underhand shot.  The ball arcs through the
	air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere
	and swats it away.

				REF
		Get that crap outta here!

	The crowd BOOS!  Nicky and the ref stare at each other.

				NICKY (O.S.)

		Alright, how about this?  I get one more

	dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then

				JOHN
		She was human?

				BEEFY
		Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man,

		I dated a Japanese girl once.  My

		Easy, Liberace.

	head bumps the window.  She turns, startled.  She sees the
	beaming Nicky.

				NICKY
		Hey.

				VALERIE
		Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.

	Pause.  Valerie opens the window and sprays a can of mace
	right in Nicky's face.

				NICKY
		Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!

	Nicky stands up and stumbles around.

				VALERIE
		What were you thinking coming here?

				NICKY
		I'm not sure, but it didn't involve
		getting blinded with poison.

	He bounces off the front rail, stumbles backward and goes
	flying over the back rail.

	EXT. VALERIE'S STREET - NIGHT

	We see Nicky hurtling toward the street.  Holding his eyes.

				VALERIE
		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!

	Suddenly he stops.  Suspended above ground.  Valerie doesn't
	hear the expected thud.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Nicky?

	He floats up, but he can't see.

				NICKY
		Valerie?

				VALERIE
		Are you dead?

				NICKY
		No.

				VALERIE
		What are you doing?

				NICKY
		I think I'm floating.

				VALERIE
		Why would you be floating?

				NICKY
		I don't know.  Maybe it's because of
		your sweet voice.

				VALERIE
		Am I supposed to not be freaked out
		right now?  Because I am.

	He's floating up.  He slows down.

				NICKY
		I can't see you but I can smell you.
		And you make me feel alive in a way I've
		never felt before.

	CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window.
	The student's dripping candle wax on his belly.

				STUDENT
		You got the wrong window again, man.

				NICKY
		Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?

	Nicky resumes floating up.

				VALERIE
		I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.

	Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes
	still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies
	back ten feet.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		Look, just because you're floating
		doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you
		giving me the finger.

				NICKY
		That wasn't me.  I was being possessed
		by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who
		call you a gross pig.

				VALERIE
		What do you mean, "possessed?"

				NICKY
		Remember when I told you my Dad was in
		Hell?

				VALERIE
		Yes...

				NICKY
		Well, that's because he's the Devil.
		And he wants to keep his throne for
		another ten-thousand years.  Which is
		fine with me, but not with my brothers,
		so they broke out of Hell, causing my
		dad...

				VALERIE
		... "The Devil?"...

				NICKY
		...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad
		very much.  So I came to Earth to save
		him but then crazy eyes stole my flask
		and I met you and...well, my dog tells
		me I just might be in love with you.

	His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is
	totally in shock but still here.

				VALERIE
		Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.

	Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		I don't know if I should believe you.

	Nicky starts to drop.

				NICKY
		You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe
		in the butterflies.

				VALERIE
		Okay, I do.  Get back up here.

	He floats up to her holding out his hand.  Nervously, she
	takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are
	flying.

	EXT. MANHATTAN - SKY - NIGHT

	They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

				VALERIE
		This is amazing.

	They soar past some more buildings.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	The preacher sense something.  He looks to the sky, then
	holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can.

				PREACHER
		The hellbeast is above us.  He's
		invading our skies!  We're all gonna
		die!  We're all gonna die!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		He's kind of ruining the mood.

				NICKY
		Let me take care of that.

	EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

	The preacher is still angrily shouting towards the sky.

				PREACHER
		We're all gonna die!

	A fire hydrant cap turns and comes off.  A powerful blast of
	water shoots out and hits the preacher, KNOCKING him across
	the street into a plate glass window.

	EXT. NYC SKY - CONTINUOUS

				VALERIE
		Can we go fly over Central Park?

				NICKY
		Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the
		most beautiful thing I could possibly
		imagine.

	EXT. OVER THE HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

	They fly over it, away from NYC.

				VALERIE
		We're going to Jersey?

				NICKY
		East Rutherford.

	EXT. MEADOWLANDS - NIGHT

	They float high above the Meadowlands.  There is an outdoor
	concert going on.  OZZFEST.
	We hear the Ozz on stage in his encore.  He is singing "Mr.
	Crowley."  Nicky turns to Valerie.

				NICKY
		I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live
		until he was dead.
			(he looks at her)
		Please tell me you like metal.

				VALERIE
			(sings along to song)
		"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your
		head..."

	Nicky's jaw drops as he stares at her.

				NICKY
		My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.

	They slow dance tighter.  The music swells.  John and Peter
	look up from their seats far below.  Nicky sees them while
	he's holding her tight.  They give thumbs up.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

	Feeling great.  Spring in his step, we see Nicky walking down
	the street.

	He stops and smells some flowers at a Korean Tommet.  The
	KOREANS point and seem agitated by him.  Nicky gives them a
	friendly wave.

				NICKY
			(in Korean)
		Moo ya san jie bay!

	The Koreans just glare.  Nicky's confused.

	MUSIC CUE:

	A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the
	sequence.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.  Nicky
	looks back a little, unnerved.  A TAXI screeches in front of
	him.  The DRIVER gets out and goes after him.

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A group of school girls in uniform break loose from their
	teacher and start chasing Nicky.

	EXT. BROWNSTONE STOOP - DAY

	A gigantically fat guy sees Nicky run by.  He thinks about
	going after him but decides not to and takes a big bite of a
	candy bar instead.

	EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

	Ten guys playing wheelchair basketball see Nicky.  They point
	and start wheeling after him.

	EXT. HILLY STREET - DAY

	Nicky is putting some distance between him and the mob.

				NICKY
		What's going on here?

	But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to
	catch up.  They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a
	last second right turn into an alley.  The wheelchairs can't
	slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the
	bottom of the street.  The TOURIST on the top level look over
	the edge to see the crash.

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY

	Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up
	out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and
	thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break.

				NICKY
		Ow...what was that for?

				BUM
		Fifty million dollars.

	The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!"
	And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked.

	Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there
	blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running
	right at him.  He closes his eyes.

				NICKY
		Release the evil.

	Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying
	insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD.

	The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows
	immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked
	out.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the
	insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one
	exhausted Nicky.

				NICKY
		I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.

				BEEFY
		The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a
		look.

				TODD
		Been breaking all morning.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We see Dan Rather addressing the camera.

				DAN RATHER
		At a news conference earlier today,
		Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this
		beleaguered city its latest dose of bad
		news.  He revealed that the man who
		caused a sensation at basketball arena
		last night is no hero... he is, in fact,
		a mass murderer.

	We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's
	holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky's outraged.

				NICKY
		I didn't murder anybody

				BEEFY
		Look.  You were really high.  Things
		happen.

				NICKY
		I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is
		Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.

				BEEFY
		I think you're looking at him.

	ON THE TV - DAY

	We reveal that the chief is standing on a grilled-cheese
	press to keep him warm.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(on TV)
		This video shows what he did after he
		left the basketball arena yesterday...

	ON THE VIDEOTAPE - DAY

	Scarface shooting his AK-47.  Nicky's face has been crudely
	superimposed over his.

				GUY
			(Adrian's voice)
		My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all
		you suckers for no reason!

	CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE"

	ON TV - DAY

	The Chief shakes his head.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Difficult to watch, I know.  In response
		to this vicious crime, I am authorizing
		the largest reward in law enforcement
		history: fifty million dollars to the
		person or persons who bring this man to
		me.

	INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky stands outraged.

				NICKY
		This is baloney!

				BEEFY
		He superimposed your head onto
		"Scarface."

				TODD
		...which is by far DePalma's best
		work...

	A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR

	The pounding increases.

				NICKY
		I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't
		live here!

				PETER
		Dude, it's us.  Let us in.

	Nicky opens the door.  Peter and John stumble in.

				JOHN
		There's like a total mob scene coming
		this way.

	We hear VOICES of an approaching crowd coming outside.

				NICKY
		I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.

	Todd i s looking out the window.

				TODD
		Looks like they're following a giant
		trail of bug shit.

				PETER
		What'll we do now, Beefy?

				BEEFY
		I don't know, this is a little out of my
		league.

	VOICES GROW LOUDER.

				VOICES (O.S.)
		Come on.  Let's get 'em.

				JOHN
		What would your dad do, Nicky?

				NICKY
		Good idea...kill me.

				PETER
		Dude.  Seriously?

				NICKY
		Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at
		noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.

				JOHN AND PETER
			(psyched)
		Alright!

	John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen
	counter.  Nicky is dazed.

				NICKY
		That just hurt a lot.

				TODD
		I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can
		I do it?

				JOHN
		Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Nicky is in the bathtub being angrily drowned by Todd.  John
	and Peter watch happily.

				TODD
		Die, Grandma, die!

	Nicky's arm comes out with a thumbs up.  Pause.  The hand
	drops back in.  He's dead.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - LATER

	Start on a CLOSE UP of Lucifer.  He's holding cards, looking
	at his hand.

				LUCIFER
		Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the
		bra.

	The Demons and Gatekeeper are sitting around playing strip
	poker.  The Gatekeeper takes off his bra.  From behind, we
	see his breasts flop out.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
		two hillbillies were blowing on them.

	The Gatekeeper throws his hand down and storms out.  The
	Monster laughs uproariously.  Nicky enters and moves to
	what's left of his dad.  Arms, torso, and a head (with one
	ear).

				NICKY
		Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after
		me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am
		I gonna do?

				DAD
		What are you gonna do?  Look at me,
		Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I
		got one ear...

	Dad's remaining ear falls out.

				DAD (CONT'D)
		I got no ears!  I can't hear!

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Now he's got no ears!  You happy, Nicky?
		Your father's got no ears!

				NICKY
		Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have
		any advice at all for me?

				DAD
		I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear
		anything!

	Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Check one-two.  Check one-two.

				DAD
		Put it back on my head.  I'm falling
		apart here.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.
			(putting ear back on Dad)
		You get your ass back up there.  You
		save your father!

	Nicky looks very upset.

	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

	We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous.

				PETER
		You sure you're down with this?

				JOHN
		Little nervous.  Wanna puke.

	They approach the cops guarding the door.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		Looking for the chief.

				PETER
		We know where to find Nicky.

	COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside.

	INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

	Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room,
	the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT
	SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		You have what I want?

				JOHN
		Sure do.  You got what we want?

				PETER
		Fifty million bones, bro.

	He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		That's half of it.  You get the rest
		when I get Nicky.

				PETER
		Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man.
		He's not human.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Really?

				JOHN
		We think he's the son of Satan.

	PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks
	over and picks them up by their throats.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra
		careful.  Now where is he?

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

	We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We
	see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND
	CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief
	bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack.

				BAG LADY
		Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you
		are?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(never stopping)
		Emperor of the New Hell.

	They march through onto the platform for Track 33.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY

	We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky
	usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke
	comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous.

				TODD
		Where is he?  He's late.

				BEEFY
		He'll be here.  Just keep your cool,
		kid.

	They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police
	backed up by the huge police force.

				BEEFY (CONT'D)
		We've been ratted out.

	Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish.

				TODD
		You guys.  That was so uncool.

				PETER
		We thought the son of Satan would
		understand a move like this.

	Peter and John high-five.

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Okay, take these two outside.  I can
		handle this.

	The police grab Todd and put a leash on Beefy.  The cops lead
	their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter
	alone with the chief.

				CHIEF OF POLICE (CONT'D)
		Wanna see something cool?

	The chief inserts a finger into his nostril.  Then he fits
	his hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as
	he searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.
	The chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of
	his nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the
	chief's body slumps to the ground.

				ADRIAN
		Ta-da.  So what time is my brother
		expected back?

				JOHN
		Noon...

	They look at the clock.  It's noon.

				JOHN (CONT'D)
		...ish.

	Peter is sweating, kinda nervous.

				PETER
		So even though you're not really the
		chief, we still get the rest of the
		cash, right bro?

				ADRIAN
		You know what you'll get?  An
		indescribably horrific torture
		administered by demons for the rest of
		eternity.

				JOHN
		But what about the cash?  Can we keep it
		or what?

				ADRIAN
		Sure, why not?

	They high five.  Adrian smiles and waits.  It is real hot
	down there.  We hear a train coming in the distance.  A fan
	circles slowly.  They all wait for him.

				LADY
			(mumbling to herself)
		Food stamps?
		They should call 'em "dude stamps."
		Cause ever time I get one, some dude
		takes it away...

	We see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way
	towards them, drunk.  Adrian scowls at her.

				LADY (CONT'D)
		Hey, studs.  I'll let you make out with
		me for a dollar!

				JOHN
		No thanks...but we'll take that bottle
		of booze.
			(grabs the bottle, laughs)

				LADY
		Hey...that's mine.

	Peter pushes her away.

				PETER
		Beat it, ya freak.

	John and Peter high five and John swigs from the bag.

				JOHN
		Schnapps...

				PETER
			(takes the bag, swigs)
		Peppermint...alright.

	Adrian raises his eyebrows.  We see that the homeless lady is
	actually VALERIE in disguise.  She looks back, tense.  John
	offers Adrian the flask.

				JOHN
		Wanna hit?

	Hands it to him.  He takes it.

				PETER
		Drink up.  Here's to fifty million
		clams.

				ADRIAN
		To the defilement of Earth and the
		corruption of its people.

				PETER
		Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and
		let's get outta this hell-hole.

	Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.  He stops just
	before it hits his lips.  He looks at John curiously.

				ADRIAN
		It is awfully hot down here.  How do you
		manage to stay so cool?

				JOHN
		Weed lowers the body temperature.
			(stuttering)
		I read that...in, uh...er, science
		magazine.

	Adrian stares at John.  He raises the bag again.

				ADRIAN
		This liquid will probably quench my
		thirst.  Cool me off.

				PETER
		Definitely.

				JOHN
		And give you a good buzz.

				ADRIAN
		Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
		eternity.

				JOHN
		Uh.  No it won't?

	John starts to tremble a bit.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out
		and say hello...

				JOHN
		Urr...uggg...errr...

				ADRIAN
			(eyes getting red)
		I'm calling you out, brother...

	Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John
	wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.

				JOHN/NICKY
		Urrr...uggh...
			(as Nicky)
		Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful.

	Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next
	to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see
	the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside.

				ADRIAN
		Hello, Cassius.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		All right.  Let me out.

				ADRIAN
		You know, New Hell really only needs one
		new Satan.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		You mother...

	Adrian hands Nicky the flask.

				ADRIAN
		But Cassius could use some company for
		the rest of eternity.  So get in the
		flask.

	He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands.

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER

	The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal.
	Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy
	raises his leg.

				COP
		Oh, he's gotta pee.

	A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the
	group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs.

				TODD
		Run, Beefy!  Run!

	INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian stares down Nicky.

				NICKY
		I won't drink.  You can't make me.

	Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over
	to him.  He grabs her by the throat.

	We hear a train coming in the distance.

				ADRIAN
		Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.
			(Nicky is scared)
		Unlike you, she won't come back from
		where she's going.

				NICKY
		Let her go.

				ADRIAN
		I hear a train coming.  Drink.

	The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky.
	Nicky raises the flash to drink.

				VALERIE
		Don't do it.

				NICKY
		I have to, Valerie.

	We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size
	archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into
	ADRIAN'S LEG.

				ADRIAN
		Ahhh!

				BEEFY
		Now that hurt the both of us.

	Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for
	her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the
	tracks.  Right into the oncoming train.

				NICKY
		Valerie!!!

	Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from
	Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky.

				ADRIAN
		See you in Hell!

	WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky.

	INT. HELL GATES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian comes flying through the solid firefall into Hell.  He
	looks around.  Confused, there's no Nicky.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEAUTIFUL FIELD - DAY

	Nicky is lying in a huge field of tall, very green grass.  He
	sits up, and feels his face to make sure it's all there.

	Nicky looks around, alarmed.  He seems to be in a mountain
	vale, maybe in the foothills of the Alps.  It's gorgeous.

	Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday
	cake.  Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating
	down to him.

	EXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	The cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.  After
	a moment's hesitation, Nicky goes in.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA
	and CHRISTA.  They are doing arts and crafts sort of things
	on a glass table in front of them.  They stare at him.  Angel
	rises.

				ANGEL
		Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're
		here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I
		am so excited right now.

				CHRISTA
		So excited.

				JENNA
		She really is.

				NICKY
		That's terrific.  Now could you ladies
		point me to the Black Palace?  I should
		check in with my dad...

	Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.

				ANGEL
		I'm sorry, you're just so cute.

				JENNA
		Do you have any idea where you are right
		now?

				NICKY
		The home of eternal damnation, house of
		Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...

				ANGEL
		Maybe try the opposite of that.

	The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.  Nicky's
	confused.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Okay, can I just ask you something?
		What do you know about your mom?

				NICKY
		My brothers told me my mother was a
		mountain goat.  Which would explain my
		chronic halitosis.

				ANGEL
			(annoyed)
		A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.

				NICKY
		My mom wasn't a goat?

				ANGEL
		Try an angel.

				NICKY
		An angel?

				ANGEL
		Unh-huh.  Which would make you half
		angel.

	Nicky is floored.

				NICKY
		Wow.  What...what did she look like?

				ANGEL
		Well, she was about six-three, only
		spoke Portuguese and had really long
		grey hair.

	The GIRLS start laughing.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		I'm sorry, I'm totally busting on you.
		I'm your mom.

	Nicky is even more floored.  FLASH.  Jenna has taken a
	picture of Nicky.

				JENNA
		I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest
		look on your face.

				CHRISTA
		You're gonna be so happy she did that.

				NICKY
			(stunned)
		How come you're not older?

				ANGEL
		Angels don't get any older, son.

				JENNA
		I can't believe you just called him
		"son."

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.

	They laugh.  Nicky is quite baffled.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

	Dad is just a pair of lips, with ears on either side held up
	by two forearms with hands attached, lying on the throne.
	Gatekeeper, Lucifer, Jimmy and a few other demons stand
	around.

				DAD
		I can't see shit.  You're all still
		here, right?

	Adrian enters.  They all cheer.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Adrian's here.  You'll be back to normal
		in a jiffy, sir.

				DAD LIPS
		Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came
		through.

				ADRIAN
		Where's Nicky?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		He came with you and Cassius, right?

				ADRIAN
		I came through that gate alone.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry, sir, false alarm.

				DAD
		Boooo.

				ADRIAN
		Somebody explain what's going on.

	Puts the Gatekeeper in a headlock.

				GATEKEEPER
		You'll get nothing out of me.

				ADRIAN
		Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
		lips.

	He twists a breast.  The Gatekeeper babbles out the
	information immediately.

				GATEKEEPER
		The only way to save your dad is for you
		and your brothers to pass through the
		gates at the same time before he
		deteriorates completely.

				ADRIAN
		How much time does Dad have before that
		happens?

	Adrian twists hard.

				GATEKEEPER
		Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims
		his throne will have unimaginable power.

	Adrian throws him down.

				LUCIFER
		All boobs and no balls.

				ADRIAN
		Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't
		mind if I take a seat while I wait for
		you.

	He moves to the throne and throws the lips off.

				DAD LIPS
		Ahhh!

	He pushes Lucifer out of the way.

				LUCIFER
		I don't get no respect.

				ADRIAN
		Ten thousand years.  And I never once
		got to sit here.

	He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.  He
	grins as two horns grow out of his forehead.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Wow.  And this is just a little taste of
		my power.

				DAD
		Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons,
		get him out of the chair!

	The demons approach.

				ADRIAN
		Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are
		a couple of million evil souls on Earth
		ready to be harvested.  Anyone
		interested?

	The demons stop.  Now loyal to Adrian.  All except Jimmy.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY

	Everyone is sitting around drinking Diet Cokes.

				NICKY
		Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?

				CHRISTA
		No, their mother's weren't angels.

				ANGEL
		I think they were hookers or strippers
		or something really porno like...

	There's a knock on the door. It opens and in comes Carl
	Weathers dressed as Chubbs from Happy Gilmore.

				CHUBBS
		Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your
		Mambo lesson.

				ANGEL
		Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so
		sorry.  I have company.  It's my son,
		Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?

				CHUBBS
		Wow, that's terrific.

				ANGEL
		Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a
		golf pro, but up here he's the dopest
		dance instructor.

				CHUBBS
		You mambo?

				NICKY
		I don't think so.

				CHUBBS
		Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's
		all in the hips.

	Chubbs dances as he leaves.

				NICKY
		Where did you meet my father?

				ANGEL
		It was a long time ago, at some Heaven
		and Hell mixer.

				CHRISTA
		I remember that night, you had like four
		daiquiris.

				ANGEL
		Try four and a half.  At first I totally
		didn't like him.

				JENNA
		He was really conceited.

				ANGEL
		But I don't know, he was funny, he made
		me laugh, and I hate to say it but he
		had a really nice body.

				NICKY
		And that made you want to make a baby
		with him?

	The Angels laugh.

				ANGEL
		Well, I really wasn't thinking about
		making a baby at the time!

	Her cell-phone rings.  She answers it.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		Hello....yes, he's here with me now... I
		don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you
		perv!  I'll call you back...
			(laughs)
		Oh my G-d, I will call you back,
		goodbye.
			(hangs up)
		That was my friend, Michelle, she says
		"hi."

				NICKY
		Well tell her I said "hi" back.

	Angel makes a motion towards the phone, then stops.

				ANGEL
		I'll call her later.

				CHRISTA
		You know, we saw you save your
		girlfriend's life.

				JENNA
		That was so cool.

				ANGEL
		That's why you came up to Heaven instead
		of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically
		gets you here.

				NICKY
		How did you see me?

				ANGEL
		We can see what's going on anywhere on
		Earth.  Look.

	Angel and the girls clear the junk from the glass table in
	front of them.  Angel touches the glass and it turns into a
	reflection of Earth below.

	EXT. TIME'S SQUARE - NIGHT

	People are rioting in the streets.  Looting appliance
	stores...

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		All these good people have totally been
		led astray.

				CHRISTA (O.S.)
		Show him Central Park.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK LAWN - NIGHT

	People are drinking and smoking and burning things.  A large
	circle has formed around two old ladies who are fist
	fighting.  One old lady knocks the other to the ground, then
	jumps on her and starts wailing away.  The spectators
	exchange money.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		There's like a three day rave goin' on
		down there.  No on is going to work
		anymore.

	Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian
	on his throne start to be thrust upwards.  Demons swarm
	around him.

				ADRIAN
		Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to
		see all of you here.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did
		Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay?

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		Let's see...

				     RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.

				DAD LIPS
		I was a good Devil, wasn't I?

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You were the best Devil, boss, the best
		Devil!

				GATEKEEPER
		Absolutely.

				DAD LIPS
		I tried to do some interesting stuff...

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		You did amazing stuff!

				GATEKEEPER
		I don't know how you came up with some
		of it.

				DAD LIPS
		Really?  That means a lot to me.

				JENNA (O.S.)
		Oh my G-d.  He looks gross.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		I can't believe I did it with him.

	She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to:

	EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT

	Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX
	HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd.

				ADRIAN
		I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to
		sin with minimal prompting.

	The crowd cheers.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		You're acting as if there is no Heaven
		or Hell.

	The crowd cheers.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT

	We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on
	flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted
	harness that looks like underwear.

				ADRIAN
		Well, I have some news.

	Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier.

				CARDINAL
		There is most definitely a Hell!  And
		you're all going there when you die!
		Which will happen in about fifteen
		minutes.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad
	and they get scared.
	The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through
	the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out.

				PREACHER
		We really are gonna die!

	This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to
	run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

				PETER
		This don't look good.

				JOHN
		Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get
		us out of this?

				TODD
		They castrated him.  He can't shoot
		arrows, he can't piss smoke.

				BEEFY
		I can't screw.
			(whimpers)
		I can't screw.

	Valerie's crying.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is shocked.

				NICKY
		Valerie's crying!

				ANGEL
		She's so nice.

				CHRISTA
		She goes to Parson's, right?

				ANGEL
		I would totally love to go there.  But I
		hear it's really hard to get in.

				NICKY
		I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I
		gotta help everybody.

				ANGEL
		Yeah, you do...

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is looking at a clock tower that reads 11:45.

				ADRIAN (V.O.)
		At the stroke of midnight, my father
		will be completely deteriorated.  And
		all of your souls will be mine.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Soon you will see things more horrible
		than you can even imagine.

	Adrian scans the crowd.  He sees...

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The Parsons STUDENT in the kimono dancing sexily.  Adrian is
	thrown.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.

	Adrian motions to some of his guards.  They nod.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
		bring you a dear sweet man and an
		international icon...Henry Winkler!

	A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by
	two DEMONS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The scared bad people finally smile.

	EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

				ADRIAN
		Covered in bees!

	We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm
	of bees.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	The crowd gasps.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky is starting to panic.

				NICKY
		But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger
		and smarter than me.

				ANGEL
		Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely.
		But you have something he doesn't have.

				NICKY
		A speech impediment?

	The girls laugh.

				ANGEL
		No, you have the inner light.  You can
		totally use it.  It's the best power of
		all.
			(he smiles)
		And in case you get in real bad trouble,
		G-d told me to give you this.

	She gives him an ornate, jewelled ball.

				NICKY
		What is it?

				ANGEL
		I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d
		said when the time comes, you'll know
		what to do.

				CHRISTA
		G-d's so smart.

				JENNA
		The smartest.

				ANGEL
		Well, goodbye...for now.
			(looks at his face)
		Can I just do this?

	She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead.

				ANGEL (CONT'D)
		That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it?

				FRIEND
		Totally.

				NICKY
		Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
			(to Angel)
		Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?

				ANGEL
		It would be so okay.

	Nicky hugs his Mom.

				NICKY
		Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple
		cause I'm gonna rock that town like a
		hurricane.

				ANGEL (O.S.)
		You're already there...

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT

	Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see
	the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards
	him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and
	concentrates.

				NICKY
		Release...the good.

	When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around
	the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching.
	THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial
	expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the
	butterflies.

	ANGLE ON

	MORE DEMONS keep closing.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the good...

	Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see
	fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting
	them.

	The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Release the awesome.

	...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of
	POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of
	chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Put it in your mouth and let it slide
		down your throat-hole.

	The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little.

				DEMON
		Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!

	The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS

	Only ten minutes left.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously.

				TODD
		One thing I really regret is never
		having experimented sexually.

				PETER
		You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
		Burner?  What are you talking about?

				JOHN
		He means getting it on with someone like
		that freak.

	ANGLE ON:

	The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon.

	BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN

				TODD
		His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.

				JOHN
		Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT

	Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by
	butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down
	the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden
	light/haze of good around them.

	EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS

	Adrian is underneath Valerie.

				ADRIAN
		You know, from this angle, you're kind
		of cute.

				VALERIE
		You think so?  Why don't you come a
		little closer and I'll show you a better
		angle.

	He moves a little closer, and she spits on him.  He smiles.
	Opens his mouth and catches her spit.  He swallows.

				ADRIAN
		Yummy.

	Everyone is grossed out.

				TODD
		Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
		swallowed that spit.

				BEEFY
		That turn you on there, RuPaul?

				ADRIAN
		Keep it up and I just might make you my
		Queen for a night or two.

				JOHN
		You want a queen?  Got one right here.

	John points at Todd.  They laugh.  Adrian gets closer to
	Valerie.  Just then a big butterfly appears on his shoulder.
	He looks down to see:

	Nicky standing there with his army.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		Little Nicky.

				NICKY
		Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the
		name of all that is good: release my
		friends and get in the flask.

				ADRIAN
		Is this a joke?

				NICKY
		No.  It's the inner light.  And with it
		we can defeat anything you've got.

				REFORMED DEMON
			(eating Popeye's chicken)
		It's true!

	Adrian glares down at the REFORMED DEMON.  His eyes shoot out
	an evil ray.

	The Reformed Demon explodes into a million pieces.  His
	golden insides splatter on the crowd.

	The Army of Good is shaken.  Another Demon lowers his
	chicken.

				ANOTHER REFORMED DEMON
		It's not true?

	The BUCKET OF CHICKEN sprouts legs and runs away.  Nicky
	steps forward bravely.

				NICKY
		Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no
		choice.

	Nicky leaves frame and he flies up towards Adrian.

	 EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Nicky lands on both feet standing before Adrian.

				NICKY
		Love lifts me up where I belong.

	ANGLE ON

	Crowd reacts.

	ON HELL STAGE

	Demons are ready to attack.  Adrian waves them off.

				ADRIAN
		Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what
		you've got.

	Nicky thinks, holds out his hands.  A rainbow shoots out onto
	the stage between them.  PAUSE.  We see that a cute little
	chipmunk is standing on it's hindlegs eating a nut.

	ON CROWD

	The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see
	this.

	BACK ON HELL STAGE

	Adrian nods, holds out his arms and a red stream shoots out.
	He has made a terrible PYTHON that comes over and eats the
	baffled chipmunk in one bite.

	Nicky raises his hand and: turns the snake into a row of
	flowers.

	Adrian raises his hand and a crazed MEXICAN GARDNER with a
	lawn mower comes by and mows them down.

	Nicky turns the Gardner and his lawn mower into a MOTHER
	pushing a NEW BORN BABY in a carriage.

	Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who
	leaps out and starts beating up on the mother.

	Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf
	stops beating her up and holds her hand.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my
		bare hands.

	Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the
	platform.

	Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit,
	when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.

	INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS

	We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS
	watching the action on the table.

				ANGEL
		I totally had to do that.

				ALL THE GIRLS
		Yah you did.

	CHUBBS is there, too.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky
	rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and
	bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back
	down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds
	out the flask.

				NICKY
		Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the
		flas...

	Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face,
	sending him flying off the bed.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!

	Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of
	awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed.

	Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air
	to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it
	lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes
	down hard.  Nicky towers over him.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Now will you get in the flask?

				ADRIAN
		Absolutely not.

	Adrian turns to his demons.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		A little help over here.

	A bunch of Demons advance.

	ON FLAGPOLE

	We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run
	over and lowers the five from the flagpoles.

	ON ADRIAN

	He looks up and glares at Henry.

				ADRIAN (CONT'D)
		Henry!

	ON FLAGPOLE

	Henry's eyes widen.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Oh no.

	He is covered in bees again.

	BACK ON ADRIAN

	He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by
	demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't
	open his mouth.

	Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his
	mouth.

				ADRIAN
		Goodbye, Nicky.

	We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls.

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Come on in, bro.

	Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams
	the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in.
	Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to
	grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him.

	As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR:

				CASSIUS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
		Thank you, Nicky.  Cause now I'm gonna
		bust Adrian's head wide open.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		I was going to let you out, eventually,
		Cassius.  I swear.

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I
		heard him keep saying.

	We HEAR the sounds of a struggle.

	All the Demons and all the people of NEW YORK form a large
	circle around the flask.  Valerie and the gang make it down
	off the stage.

	We HEAR crazy sounds as the FLASK starts to jump.  The crowd
	REACTS.  A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a
	horrible thud.

				VALERIE
		Nicky!

				NICKY (O.S.)
		That was Cassius!

	The FLASK starts rolling over and over on the road.  People
	get out of the way as if it were real people fighting in the
	street.  They root for their side.

				DEMON
		Kill him, Adrian.

	John and Peter start beating up the Demon.

	INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	The Angel and the Friend are praying.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - CONTINUOUS

	We HEAR banging and beating and yelling from inside and then
	the flask stops bouncing.  SILENCE.  Everybody outside holds
	their breath.  Slowly out of the spout crawls NICKY.

	HOORAY.  Valerie, John, Todd and Beefy and all the living
	people CHEER.  The student, very happy, opens his kimono.
	The people and demons near him are grossed out.

	Valerie goes tot he very beaten up Nicky and hugs him.

				VALERIE
		Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to
		fight like that?

				NICKY
		From my dad's side of the family.

	She laughs and kisses him on the mouth.  The crowd CHEERS.
	But Nicky won't stop kissing her.  She starts to struggle for
	air.  Nicky presses harder and starts to laugh.

	The crowd stops CHEERING.  Valerie is waving her arms for
	help.  Nicky turns into Adrian during the kiss.  Adrian lets
	her go.  And we hear ADRIAN'S familiar laugh.

				ADRIAN
		What?  No tongue?

	Adrian pulls his head back, his tongue is huge and he turns
	into a GIANT BAT.  He lets out a huge roar, then flies
	around, laughing, scaring people.

	Valerie runs over and picks up the flask.  She looks inside.

				VALERIE
			(whispering)
		Nicky. Nicky.

	No response.

				VALERIE (CONT'D)
		You gotta fly out...I know you can do
		it.
			(still no response)
		Do it for the butterflies.

	A long beat, then:

				NICKY (O.S.)
		Butterflies...

	And Nicky shoots right out of the top of the flask and lands
	on his feet.  Adrian lands and stares down Nicky.  The clock
	is one minute from midnight.

	Adrian swoops down.  Nicky thinks quick and pulls out the
	BALL his Mom gave him and smashes it on the ground.  Out of
	it forms metal G-d: OZZY OSBORNE.

				OZZY
		Hello, New York.

				JOHN AND PETER
		Ozzy.

	They faint.

	The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.  Ozzy grabs the bat, his
	mouth grows big, and he bites the bat's head off.  Valerie
	hands Ozzy the flask.

				VALERIE
		Put him in, Ozzy.

	Ozzy spits the bat head into the flask.

	EXT. CLOCK TOWER

	The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The
	FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds.
	The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are
	on their backs crying like babies.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

				VALERIE
		Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.

				JOHN
		He'll never make it.

				PETER
		You gotta kill yourself.

				NICKY
		I'll just go to Heaven.

				BEEFY
		No if you do something bad right before
		you die.

	PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler.

				HENRY WINKLER
		Aw, man, not again.

				NICKY
		Sorry, Henry.
			(focuses)
		Release the Evil.

	Henry is covered in bees once again.

	ON NICKY AND VALERIE

	Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie.

				NICKY (CONT'D)
		Do me.

				VALERIE
		I love you.

				NICKY
		I love you.

	Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him.

	ON CLOCK TOWER

	Six seconds left.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The lips and finger are slowing down.

	INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY

	Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it
	starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP
	SOULS fall out on top of Nicky.

	The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The STAGE, the DEMONS and everything that raised from Hell
	now descends quickly into the ground.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

	Dad's lips form a body around it.  Dad FILLS IN.

	EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT

	The good people of New York cheer.  We see John, Peter, Todd,
	Valerie, Beefy and the Student, who of course is dancing
	seductively.

	EXT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is so proud.

				ANGEL
		Okay, you just saw my son save the

	Everyone cheers.

	INT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER

	Dad and Nicky are hugging.

				DAD
		You came through, Nicky.

				NICKY
		I came through for you, Mom and the
		butterflies, Dad.

				DAD
		You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's
		no butterflies here.  If you want
		butterflies, you need to be on Earth.

				NICKY
		What about you and Grandpa and everyone
		in Hell?

				DAD
		Nicky, I let my butterflies die once
		upon a time and it's never stopped
		hurting.
			(Dad looks up)
		That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm
		still in love with you.

	INT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - CONTINUOUS

	Angel is shocked.

				ANGEL
		Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about

	INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Dad turns to Nicky.

				DAD
		Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got
		up high.  You take care of the middle.

				NICKY
		I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley
		Crue, this will always be my...home
		sweet home...

	He pats him on the back.

				JIMMY THE DEMON
		Sorry to interrupt guys, but it's time
		for Hitler's punishment.

				LUCIFER
		Let me handle that.

	Lucifer walks over to the closet.

				LUCIFER (CONT'D)
		And I'm not using a pineapple this time.

	He pulls out the flask.

				ADRIAN (O.S.)
		No!

				CASSIUS (O.S.)
		Don't do it!

	He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.  Hitler's face tightens.

				HITLER
		Holy Schnit!

	FREEZE FRAME, then:

					DISSOLVE TO:

	ONE YEAR LATER

	Over the skyline of Manhattan.

	EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK WEST

	PAN UP from a moving baby stroller to reveal Nicky and
	Valerie both pushing it.  We see Beefy walking with them.
	Unbelievably happy.

	A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.

				LADY
		Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.

				VALERIE
		Thank yo.

				LADY
		Such a little angel.

				BEEFY
		Only a quarter, ma'am.

	She tickles the baby.  It giggles and a small stream of fire
	shoots out of his mouth and singes the Old Lady's eyebrows.

				NICKY
		Zachariah, say you're sorry.

				BABY ZACHARIAH
			(sounds like Nicky)
		Sorry.

	The Lady scurries away.  Nicky and Valerie laugh and continue
	walking in absolute bliss.  They pass the Preacher who runs
	towards us.

				PREACHER
		He has spilled his seed!  He is
		multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the
		unholy union!  We're all gonna die!

	The Preacher runs straight into the camera.  BLACK.

					    THE END.
"Lord of Illusions" -- by Clive Barker

 

	TITLE SEQUENCE


	As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY


	A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
	surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
	Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
	their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
	broken glass teeth.

	EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

	Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
	flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat.

	END CREDITS.

				CUT WIDE TO;

	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

	A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
	make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
	Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
	The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
	SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY

	We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
	sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
	scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
	narrows his eyes.

	BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.

	The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
	house.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(softly)
		Swann...?

	He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
	whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

	The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
	become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
	scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
	helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

	A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
	They watch Nix in adoration. 

	As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...

				NIX
		And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
		you're my instrument. From now on,
		you'll be called the Puritan...

				CULTISTS
			(murmuring)
		Puritan...

	NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

	Butterfield enters. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	Nix looks up.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Swann's here. 

	Nix rises, smiling.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		We'll come back to this. Get about
		your business. 

	As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
	SOBBING.

				NIX
		Hush...

	Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
	mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

				NIX
		I said hush.

				GIRL
		Please.  Let me go.

	From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
	Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

				NIX
			(to Baboon)
		What is it?

	The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.

				NIX
			(to Girl)
		I think he's in love.

	He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
	trailing its chain.

				GIRL
		Keep it away from me.

	Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
	catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

				GIRL
		Please... please...

	Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		Want me to shoot Swann?

				NIX
		You don't like him, do you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		He wants your magic.

				NIX
		Maybe.  Go fetch him.

	Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

				GIRL
		What are you going to do?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY

	The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

	From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
	studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
	skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
	steely gaze.

				SWANN
			(to all three)
		Are we ready?

				JENNIFER
			(cool)
		Say the word.

				PIMM
			(very nervous)
		Look, maybe we should think this over.

	On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.

				SWANN
		No.  He's gone too far.

				PIMM
		So he took a child.

				JENNIFER
		He'll kill her.

				PIMM
		No he won't.

				SWANN
			(determined)
		He's not going to get the chance.

	Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

				QUAID
		If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

				SWANN
		So stay out here.

	Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

	Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's expecting you.

	Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

				SWANN
			(to others)
		Look around.  If you find 'the
		child, yell.  She's got blonde
		hair, that's all I know.

	Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
	him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY

	Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
	(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.

				1ST MAN
		Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
		weren't coming back.

				QUAID
		I changed my mind.

				1ST WOMAN
		Come and join us.

	She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
	appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

	And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
	Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
	away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.

				SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
			(angry)
		Don't do that!

	The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
	Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

	INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY

	Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
	a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

				JENNIFER
		Don't be afraid.

	The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
	pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
	of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

				BARBARA
		I'm not... want to see?

	She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
	her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
	retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
	is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
	his white-knuckled fingers.

				PIMM
		He's going to kill us all...

				JENNIFER
		Where did Swann go?

	Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
	his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
	He turns the door handle.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
	folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
	muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

	On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
	he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

	He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
	dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

	Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
	passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

				QUAID
		Stay the fuck away!
			(yells)
		Pimm!  Get over here!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
	struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.

				SWANN
		You're going to be okay.

	Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
	face.  Swann turns.

				NIX
		I knew you'd come. 

	He reaches down to Swann.

				NIX
		I've got so much power to give
		you, Swann.  All you have to do
		is...beg.

				SWANN
		Fuck you.

				NIX
		You don't think I've got it to
		give?

				SWANN
		No!

	Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
	gravity.

				NIX
		You're wrong.

	He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
	against the wall.

				NIX
		I could eat your fucking soul,
		Swann.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
	from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
	hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

				JENNIFER
		Fuck!

	She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

				NIX
		You want to know what the world
		really looks like?

	Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

	And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

				NIX
		Want to see flesh with a god's
		eyes?

	Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
	Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Aah!

				QUAID
		Get away from the door!

	Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
	strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
	growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
	open, and enters.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

				QUAID
		Swann?

				NIX
			(to Quaid)
		Here he is.

	Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
	eyes blood-red.

				NIX
		Take a look, Swann!  These are your
		friends.

	On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
	Jennifer.

				JENNIFER (V.O.)
		What have you done to him? 

SWANN'S P.O.V.

	of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Swann.  It's okay.

	Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.

				SWANN
		Don't touch me.  He's got... got
		into my head.

				NIX
		You want to be like that, Swann? 
		Mud and shit?

	Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

	SWANN'S P.O.V. 

	of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
	aura of pulsing light.

				NIX
		Come here.  Share the power.

	ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
	pulled. 

	The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

	SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
	something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
	FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	Swann covers his eyes.

				NIX
			(raging, terrifying)
		Swann!  Swann!

	Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
	ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

				NIX
			(a roar)
		Help me!

	Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
	control.

				SWANN
		Jesus-

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY

	Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

				1ST CULTIST
			(with distressing
		confidence)
		You can't kill him.

				2ND CULTIST
		He'll just rise up again!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
	his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

				NIX
		Help me!

	Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
	Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

				JENNIFER
		Quickly!

	They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
	SCREWS in then all.

				NIX
			(seeing)
		Swann?  What are you doing?

				SWANN
		Binding you.

	He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
	eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
	from the screw-holes.

				NIX
		Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

	Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

				NIX
		Sw

	He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

	And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

				GIRL
			(quietly)
		Is it finished?

				SWANN
		It's finished.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
	had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
	their confidence and courage gone. 

	Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
	body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

				PIMM
		Dead?

				QUAID
		Dead.

				PIMM
		What now?

				SWANN
		We bury him so deep no one will
		ever find him.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK

	The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield
	dashes towards camera, then halts. 

	HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
	into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

	ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY

	The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
	gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
	some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
	congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

	ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY

	The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
	a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
	it has a certain charm.

	INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

	A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
	host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
	At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
	HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty
	but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
	name.

				BLONDE GIRL
		How'd you spell that again?

				HARRY
		D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry
		D'Amour.

				BLONDE GIRL
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
		Isn't that French for something?

	ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Yeah.  It's French.

				BLONDE GIRL
		For love, right?

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
			(grinning)
		That's so cool.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

	Harry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-
	shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  He's
	handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

				HARRY
		Yeah?

				BELLBOY
		You haven't paid the cab.  He won't
		give us your bags 'til you pay him.

				HARRY
		How much?

				BELLBOY
		Thirty-five bucks.

				HARRY
		Tell him he can keep them. The
		Bellboy looks puzzled.

				HARRY
		Just kidding.

	Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
	bills.

				HARRY
		I've got my life in there.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	On the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it
	open.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
	of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A
	CRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
	destruction. 

	ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the
	shower.  Starts to undress.

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK

	Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
	sun.  Squints.  Puts on sunglasses.

				HARRY
		Hello, L.A.

				BELLBOY
		Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

				HARRY
		You bet.

	EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
	classy restaurant.  It's RAINING.
	ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
	WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
	Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

	ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
	recorder.

				HARRY
		Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either
		got a great sense of humour or he's
		paying her to laugh.
			(looks at hamburger in
		disgust)
		Jesus.

	On Tapert, as he rises from the table.

				HARRY
			(into tape recorder)
		He's finished.

	Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
	tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.

	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

	Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
	up and gets in.

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

				HARRY
			(into tape)
		Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off
		again.

	He turns the key in the ignition.

				CUT  TO:

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT

	In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  It
	reads:  TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL

	ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
	door beside the store window. 

	WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
	side of the street. 

	Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,
	puzzled.

				HARRY
		Superstitious?

	He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

				TAPERT (V.O.)
		Oh my God!

	Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
	his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
	need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
	latter, and steps inside.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
	past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

	At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
	halts, and takes out his GUN. 

	There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
	corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
	CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
	the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
	door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
	FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
	which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

	From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Ahh. . .

	Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
	shadows. 

	His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
	and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

	Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
	Fortune Telling Room.

				MILLER
		Fuckhead.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
	table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
	tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
	from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
	table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

	Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

				HARRY
		What the fuck!?

	Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
	door.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

	As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
	FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
	His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

				HARRY
			(to Butterfield)
		Don't touch him."

	Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
	in pain. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		What are you going to do about it? 

	Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Harry)
		Ever watched a man die?  If you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		And if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.

				QUAID
		Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
		there.  Ask Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
		was coming home. 

	As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
	side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
	defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So do you.  You've seen the future. 
		Haven't you?

				QUAID
		Yes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		And are you afraid?

				QUAID
		Yes.

	Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
	CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
	against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
	around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

	Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
	belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
	which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

	Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

				QUAID
			(to Harry)
		Don't leave me.

	He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
	goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
	stairs.


				HARRY
		You need an ambulance.

				QUAID
			(in pain)
		Too late.  Why are you here? Did
		you cone... up here for a reading? 

	Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		NO ... I...

	Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
	forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

				QUAID
			(quietly)
		My God.

				HARRY
		What?

				QUAID
		You've taken some strange
		journeys in your life.

				HARRY
		Yeah.  You could say that.

				QUAID
		You're drawn to the dark side, over
		and over.  And it's drawn to you.
			(looks at Harry)
		You don't like that.

				HARRY
		Not much.

				QUAID
		You can't change it.  You have to
		walk...
			(coughs)
		...walk the line between Heaven and
		Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept
		it.

	Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
	pain.

				HARRY
		Hold on.

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

				HARRY
		The Puritan?

				QUAID
		Yes...

				HARRY
		Who is he? 

	Quaid shudders, and dies.

				HARRY
			(softly; sadly)
		Shit.

	He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over
	but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which
	pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
	all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

	The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
	DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
	blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway
	through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
	OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

				EDDISON
			(to Harry)
		What were you doing up there?

				HARRY
		I'm a private detective.  I was
		hired to follow somebody for a few
		days.  A guy called Tapert.
		Insurance fraud.

				EDDISON
			(writing)
		Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,
		Butterfield.

				HARRY
		Tapert's got nothing to do with
		this.  He came here to get his palm
		read.

				EDDISON
		What makes you so sure?

				HARRY
			(shrugs)
		I got a file on him two inches
		thick.  He's a petty fraudster.
		This is something else.  Ever heard
		of someone called the Puritan?

				EDDISON
		New one on me.
			(to Officer)
		Okay.  Let's see him.

	OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
	GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

				EDDISON
		Where the fuck is he?

				HARRY
		He got up and walked.

				EDDISON
			(looking up at window)
		After that fall?. He must have
		broken half his bones.

	WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.

				HARRY
		I don't think he'd have given a
		shit.

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The rooms are spartan.  Nothing on the walls.  Nothing on the
	floors.  Very little furniture. 

	Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
	long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his
	voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it
	already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

	Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
	out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

				BUTTERFIELD
		D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know
		that name?

				MILLER
		I know him.  I saw him.

	He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
	sighing with pleasure.

				MILLER
		I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got
		possessed and he saved the little
		bastard's life.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's a priest?

				MILLER
		No.  He's just a guy who's got a
		nose for this shit.
			(a beat.  A smirk)
		Like you.

	A long beat of silence.  Butterfield combs.  Miller digs for
	glass.

				BUTTERFIELD 
		I don't want him getting in the
		way.

				MILLER
		He won't. 

	Another silence.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(dreamily)
		We've all of us waited too long to
		have the homecoming spoiled.

				MILLER
		What do you mean, "all of us?"

				BUTTERFIELD
		You didn't think it was just going
		to be you and me?  A lot of people
		believed in Nix. They haven't
		forgotten his promise.

		Death.

		What about death?

	hypnotic eyes.

	He studies the L.A. TIMES in front of him.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

	VALENTIN is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in Swann's

	hair combed back close to his scalp. Immaculately dressed in
	a distinctively European fashion.  Precise.  Cautious. 
	Elegant. 

	He orders the TWO PICTURE-HANGERS in a clipped fashion.

	Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

		Probably.

		It's not a bad place.  Warm.

		do with the man you saw murdered.

				HARRY
		Did your husband know Quaid?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.  They weren't close, but they
		saw each other once in a while.  I
		think Philip believes all that
		stuff with the tarot cards.

				HARRY
		You don't?

				DOROTHEA
		I think we make our own futures.

	Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

				HARRY
		What's the connection?

				DOROTHEA
			(covering now, but well)
		I don't exactly know. 
		Philip doesn't like to talk about
		the past.

				HARRY
		Why not?

	Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze
	is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the
	two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

				DOROTHEA
		He's a secretive man.

				HARRY
		And you don't ask questions?

				DOROTHEA
		We don't share our lives the way a
		lot of people do.

				HARRY
		Does that mean...?

				DOROTHEA
		We haven't slept in the same bed
		for years.

				HARRY
		But obviously you still care what
		happens to him.

				DOROTHEA
		We wouldn't be having this
		conversation if I didn't. Swann's
		one of the most remarkable men
		alive.

	Harry, frowns.

				DOROTHEA
		You don't believe me.

				HARRY
		He's an illusionist.  It's not
		exactly brain surgery. 

	Dorothea stares at him. 

				HARRY
		Sorry.  You asked.

				DOROTHEA
		No.  You're right.  He could have
		been something more. Maybe a lot
		more.  But people get lost.  Even
		good people. Too much fame.  Too
		much money,

				HARRY
		Where do I sign? 

	Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

				DOROTHEA
		Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

				HARRY
		Harry.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.

				HARRY
		I'm no bodyguard.

				DOROTHEA
		That's not what I'm asking for. I
		want somebody who can find out what
		Philip saw in those damn cards. 
		And stop it from happening.

				HARRY
		When do you want me to start?

				DOROTHEA
		Come to the show with me. Tonight I
		want you to see him with an
		audience.  They love him.

				HARRY
		Do you?

	The question catches Dorothea off guard.

				DOROTHEA
		I didn't marry him for love, Mr.

		Sure.

	Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches

	The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
	He makes his way inside.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a

	The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,

	The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
	apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
	blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
	into mystery.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Ladies and gentlemen.  You are
		standing on the threshold of a

	A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
	stage. 

	The vortex BLAZES -- 

	And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
	of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
	toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

	Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
	miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
	dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
	Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
	The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
	open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
	dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
	spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

	A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
	tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
	feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
	The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
	crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
	sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

				SWANN
		My friends ... come with me...into
		the Great Beyond.

	A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 

	The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly.

	ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
	DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
	somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
	It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
	glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
	struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
	the wheel spins faster and faster. 

	Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
	outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
	to his head. 

	ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

	BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
	shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
	wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

	The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
	the swords DROPS. 

	The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

	As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
	carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
	him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
	stop. 

	More GASPS from the audience. 

	ON HARRY, having a -- 

	FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
	The scene on the stage is that image coming to life. 

				HARRY 
		There's something wrong... 

	ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
	third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
	until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

	ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

	The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
	nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
	dies away in a matter of moments.

	ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

				DOROTHEA
		No. . .

	ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
	wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
	reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

	There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
	sobs of horror.

				1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
		What happened?

				2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
		It's a trick.

				3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
		Somebody help him.

	The curtains start to close.

	ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

				DOROTHEA
			(to Harry)
		I've got to get to him!

	The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
	seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
	One or two are even praying. 

	Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
	against the flood of the exiting crowd.

				HARRY
		Out of the way!  Out of the way!

	He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
	she can duck beneath it.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
	watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
	MANAGER at his side.

				VALENTIN
			(to Stage Manager)
		Get then out of here, for God's
		sake --

				STAGE MANAGER
		You heard him!  It's not a fucking
		show!

	He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
	arm.

				STAGE MANAGER
		Who are you?

	Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
	MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
	which has been removed from the wheel.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
	towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
	enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

				MILLER
		Psst!

	Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

	Butterfield enters.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
	examines the mechanism of the wheel.

				DOROTHEA
			(softly)
		Swann... 

	A DOCTOR appears.

				DOCTOR 
		I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

	The Doctor checks Swann's body.

				DOCTOR
			(to Dorothea)
		I'm sorry...

	Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
	He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
	mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
	cable as he goes.

	WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

	It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
	used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
	beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
	and echoing. 

	The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
	taken. 

	A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
	FIGURE ducking away.

				HARRY
		Hey!

	He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
	listens for movement. 

	Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
	wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

	Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
	nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

				MILLER
		Got you, fucker!

	Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
	the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed
		Swann? 

	Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

				HARRY
		You did.
			(a beat)
		Didn't you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Why would I do that?

				HARRY
		Beats me.

	Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You don't have a clue what you're
		into, do you?

				HARRY
		Deep shit? 

	Butterfield hits him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
		I told you --

	Butterfield hits him again.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
			(raises his hand)
		All right.  It was...

	Butterfield comes a little closer.

				HARRY
			(feigning a near collapse)
		... it was...

	Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
	literally -- rising as he does so.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
	in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
	Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

	He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
	of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
	TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
	OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
	MECHANISM. 

	Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
	dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

	-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
	closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
	The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

	Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
	shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
	BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

				HARRY
		Deep shit...

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. 
	Eddison has just finished taking his statement.

				EDDISON
		And this Butterfield guy--

				HARRY
		--vanished.

				EDDISON
			(frustrated sigh)
		Another fucking magician. Jesus.

	Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea
	being taken into another office.

				HARRY
		Are you finished with me?

				EDDISON
		For now.  Are you planning to go
		back to New York?

				HARRY
			(watching Dorothea)
		No.  Not yet...

	INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT

	Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

				HARRY
		Are they treating you okay?

				DOROTHEA
			(nods)
		I heard what happened.  It looks
		like somebody murdered him.

				HARRY
		I'm sorry I got into this too late. 
		But if you want me to stick around,
		maybe dig where the cops don't
		look...

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where you'd start.

				HARRY
		Well... how about some of the other
		illusionists?

				DOROTHEA
		They won't tell you anything.

				HARRY
		I can be very persuasive.

				DOROTHEA
			(a beat)
		Yes.  I think you probably can.
			(another beat)
		We'd need to talk about your fee.

				HARRY
		Forget the fee.  If I find
		Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
		money.  If I don't...
			(he shrugs)
		...my gamble.  Either way... I
		get to spend some time... here.

	The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
	means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,
	it's also plain she knows it.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

	Noon.  Bright sun.  Busy street.  Harry, now wearing a
	bandage on his cut face, enters.

	INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY

	A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,
	etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them
	all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
	through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
	manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
	ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER
	WILDER. 

	Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

				HARRY
		Where'd you learn that?

				WILDER
		What?

				HARRY
			(points)
		That.

				WILDER
		At birth.  I don't know you --

				HARRY
		Harry D'Amour.

				WILDER
		I know all the kids coming up. Got
		to stay ahead of the game. But I
		don't know you.

				HARRY
		I'm in from New York.  I came to
		see Swann.

				WILDER
		What a tragedy.  It was just a
		matter of time, of course, but it's
		not good for the business.

				HARRY
		Was he taking a lot of risks?

				WILDER
		You don't know the half of it. I'm
		Walter Wilder, by the way.

				HARRY
		Not the Walter Wilder? 

	Walter beams.

				WILDER
		The one and only. 

	He hands Harry a card.

				WILDER
		Want to try?

	Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
	rest of this conversation.

				WILDER
		You know Vinovich?

				HARRY
			(not a clue)
		Sure.  Vivovich.

				WILDER
		He knew Swann way back.  He says
		there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
		crazy shit.

				HARRY
		I'd love to... you know... hang
		with some of you guys.

				WILDER
		People are pretty cagey.  Who do
		you know?

				HARRY
		For what?

				WILDER
		For an introduction.

				HARRY
		Well... nobody.

	Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
	manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

				WILDER
			(magnanimously)
		You do now.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

	The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 

	Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is
	knotting a newly-bought tie.

				HARRY
		I only wear ties for funerals.

				WILDER
		You don't get in without one. It's
		like a gentlemen's club for
		illusionists.  Except most of us
		aren't gentlemen.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

	The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with
	illusionists' posters. 

	Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
	where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
	audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to
	half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
	stairs and towards the bar.

HARRY
		Are they all in the business?

				WILDER
		It's not a business. Harry. It's a
		vocation. 

	Wilder points to a locked door.

				WILDER
		That's what they call the
		Repository.  Every magic secret
		known to man's locked up in that
		room.

				HARRY
		Have you been in?

				WILDER
		No.  There's only three keys.
		Vinovich has got one, of
		course.
			(beat)
		He's a little crazy, by the way. 
		And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
		he's a real charmer.

				CUT TO

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT

	Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his
	40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
	fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry
	and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
	LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
	two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
	overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
	waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 

	In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
	repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

				VINOVICH
		It's more than entertainment. We're
		opening people's heads up.  Putting
		miracles back into their boring
		little lives.

				BILLY
		But they're fake miracles.

				VINOVICH
		Houdini believed he had spirit
		guides.

				HARRY
		You believe that?

				VINOVICH
		I think we walk a narrow path,
		between... between...

				HARRY
		Heaven and Hell?

	Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
	he's being sarcastic or not.

				VINOVICH
		Trickery and divinity.

				HARRY
		Are you saying that sometimes
		the miracles are real?

				VINOVICH
		No.  I'm saying they were always
		fake.  The saints, the messiahs,
		they were just illusionists.

				HARRY
		So could you walk on water?

				VINOVICH
			(deadly serious)
		I could reproduce any miracle
		that's ever been performed, with a
		little preparation.

				HARRY
		What about Swann's miracles?

	The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are
	exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny
	smile.

				VINOVICH
		They weren't worth a damn.

				HARRY
			(goading)
		I heard he was the best.

				VINOVICH
		If he was so good why's he so dead?

	Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

				HARRY
		You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd
		maybe have a theory.

				VINOVICH
		Oh, I've got plenty.

				HARRY
		I'd like to hear them. 

	Vinovich rises.

				VINOVICH
		I'm not saying another word.
			(to Wilder)
		You damn fool.  He's a
		journalist.

				HARRY
		Just tell me about Swann.  Or are
		you too scared?

				VINOVICH
		He was a freak.  Everything he did
		was tainted.

	Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

				HARRY
		With what?

				VINOVICH
		Evil.  He was evil.
			(to Laura)
		Come on.

	She rises.

				VINOVICH
			(to the rest)
		Say nothing to this man if you wish
		to keep my company.

	He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-
	silenced bar.

				HARRY
		Great accent, by the way.  Is it
		Brooklyn?

				VINOVICH
			(pure Brooklyn)
		Fuck you.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Harry heads to the car.

				BILLY (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
	that he's not being watched.

				BILLY
		I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich
		sees me talking to you.  He's an
		asshole, but he's a powerful
		asshole.

				HARRY
		They go together.

				BILLY
			(lowered voice)
		I've heard a name.  Someone they
		talk about in whispers.

				HARRY
		Who?

				BILLY
		Nix.

				HARRY
		Nix?

				BILLY
		Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

				HARRY
		Who is he?

				BILLY
		I think maybe he taught Swann.
			(hands Harry a card)
		This is me.  See ya around. 

	Billy hurries away.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		... I want somebody who can find
		out what Philip saw in those damn
		cards... 

	Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

				DISSOLVE TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				BUTTERFIELD
		Ever watched a man die?

	The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

				QUAID
		Please... I wasn't there... Ask
		Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared...

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is still asleep.

				CUT TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

	A long silence. 

	SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He picks up the receiver.

				HARRY
		This is D'Amour.
 
           
			CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
	else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
	source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
	opposite the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry... I know it's late.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

	There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
	Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
	the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
	touch them.

				HARRY
		That's okay.

	As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
	page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		How did it go today?

				HARRY
		I went up to the Magic Castle. You
		were right.  He didn't have a lot
		of fans up there.

				CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		They were jealous of him.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Why?  Because he had you?

				BACK TO:

	INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN

				DOROTHEA
		He... didn't have me..  I told you-

				HARRY
		You didn't marry him for love.

	DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM

	She's a little uncomfortable now.

				HARRY
		So why did you marry him?

				DOROTHEA
		That's my business. Harry.

				HARRY
		Just curious.
			(a beat)
		Back to business.  Ever heard of a
		man called Nix?
			(silence)
		Dorothea?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't
		know the name.

				HARRY
		What about Jennifer Desiderio?

				DOROTHEA
		It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to
		go.

				HARRY
		Okay.  I'll keep digging.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		Yes.  You do that.

	She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. 
	She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks
	up the phone again.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
	Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 

	CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

	EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
	heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
	Quaid's Waiting Room. 
	It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
	prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
	locks.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  

	Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
	enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the
	TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
	Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
	blood-spattered table:

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		If you watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping.

	Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
	cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
	are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
	statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

	He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
	in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
	out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

	Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
	false bottom.

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Yes...

	In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
	He flicks to "D."

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		Desiderio...

	There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
	the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
	his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

	-- Valentin!

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		What the fuck are you doing here?

				VALENTIN
		Looking for you.  I tried the
		hotel.

				HARRY
		Why'd you come here?

				VALENTIN
		You're a detective, with no clues. 
		Where else are you going to look? 
		I'm going to keep this brief.
			(he takes out an envelope)
		Here's thirty thousand dollars.

				HARRY
		What for?

				VALENTIN
		A ticket home,

				HARRY
		You didn't hire me.  She did.
		If she wants me off the job, I
		want to hear it from her.

				VALENTIN
		She doesn't want to see you. She's
		had enough pain.  Enough churning
		over the past.  She wants it all
		left alone.

				HARRY
		Left alone?  Somebody's been
		murdered.

				VALENTIN
		Yes.  It's regrettable

				HARRY
		Fuck regrettable!  I want to know
		why.

				VALENTIN
		What for?  You need to stay busy?

				HARRY
			(a confession)
		I like to know why things happen.

				VALENTIN
		Why people die?
			(shakes his head)
		Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

				VALENTIN
		Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
		Just leave her alone.  Let her
		heal.

	He glances back at Valentin.

				HARRY
		Lock up, will you?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY

	ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

	Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
	building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

	The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
	decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
	Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
	black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's only ever had one
		visitor.

				HARRY
		A Mister Quaid?

				TOFFLER
		Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I
		saw it on the news. Jennifer
		doesn't know.  And frankly, this
		isn't the best tine for her to be
		told.

				HARRY
		I won't say anything.

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

	Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
	distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
	screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
	Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's been with us four years. 
		She was coming on nicely. 
		But just the last month or so,
		she's worse than ever.

				HARRY
		What's her problem?

				TOFFLER
		She has no real grip on reality.

				HARRY
			(a joke)
		Does anybody?

				TOFFLER
			(deadly serious)
		Oh yes.  We have to agree what's
		real and what's not. That's what
		holds us together.

				HARRY
		And what does Jennifer think's
		real?

	They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
	outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

				TOFFLER
			(quietly)
		Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
		for her.
			(louder)
		Jennifer?

	Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

	Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
	Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
	the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
	steadily gets louder as they walk.

				JENNIFER
		Have we met before?

				HARRY
		No.

				JENNIFER
		Only I forget.  They give me pills,
		you know, to keep me... even...
		and... I forget things,

				HARRY
		Well, you didn't forget me.  I just
		came because I wanted to know if
		you knew a man called Butterfield.

				JENNIFER
		Maybe... I... don't...

				HARRY
		What about Philip Swann?

				JENNIFER
		I knew Swann.
			(sudden vehemence)
		He's a fucking liar.

	A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

				HARRY
		Why's that?

				JENNIFER
		He said he knew how to protect us. 
		But he didn't know anything.  He
		made us think it was over and done
		with.

				HARRY
		What is?

				JENNIFER
			(tears nearing)
		I don't want to think about it. If
		I think about it he'll hear me. 
		He'll find me.

				HARRY
		Swann?

	Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
	laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
	we're aware of it.

				JENNIFER
		I told you.  I don't --

	She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
	and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

	The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
	shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
			(screaming)
		God no!  Oh God no!

	She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

				NURSE
		Calm down!

	She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
	back.

				JENNIFER
		He's not going to get me!

	She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
		He's not!  He's not!

				HARRY
		Who's not? 

	He catches up with her.

				JENNIFER
		Nix! Nix!

				HARRY
		Is he the Puritan?

				JENNIFER
		Yes! Yes!

				HARRY
		And he's dead?

				JENNIFER
		No.  He's coming back.  He's
		digging his way out!

	The Nurse appears behind Harry.

				NURSE
		I'll take care of her now.

	Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

				NURSE
		Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

	The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
	instantly, racing towards the street.

				HARRY
		Jennifer!

	She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
	top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
	metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
	Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

	HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

	Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
	wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
	incoherently. 

				HARRY
		Jesus.

	He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

	He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
	His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
	head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
	a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

				HARRY
			(very quietly)
		Jesus.

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

	The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

	Harry's on the phone.



				HARRY
		I want to speak to Dorothea.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		I'm afraid she's not in.

				HARRY
		When will she be in?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin on the phone in the study.

				DOROTHEA
		Who is it?

	Valentin puts the phone down.

				VALENTIN
		Crank call.  I'll get the number
		changed.

				DOROTHEA
		No word from D'Amour?			    

	Valentin shakes his head.

				VALENTIN
		It's better he's gone.  He would
		have done more harm than good.

				DOROTHEA
		Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,
		so.  Try him again at the hotel.

				VALENTIN
		I left three messages already.

	Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns
	and leaves the room.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

				HARRY
			(on phone)
		Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I
		wanted to get into the repository
		at the Magic Castle?

				CUT TO:

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT        

	THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT:  ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS. 

	PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT.  HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF
	GLASS.  BILLY'S BEHIND HIM.  THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH
	LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.

				HARRY
		You've done this before.

				BILLY
		I've had my moments.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Harry's manipulating the lock.

				BILLY
		I'm sure they'll have this place
		rigged.

				HARRY
		How?

				BILLY
		It'll be something hokey. 

	CLICK! The door opens.

				BILLY
		Houdini'd been proud of you.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
	posters in every direction.

				BILLY
			(impressed)
		Whoa...

	On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
	of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
	IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
	while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
	investigate.

				BILLY
		I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

				HARRY
		You heard right.

				BILLY
		You ever been married?

				HARRY
		Yeah.  She was killed in a car
		crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She
		was filing for divorce.

				BILLY
		Why?

				HARRY
		My life was too weird for her.

				BILLY
			(grinning)
		I love weird.

	Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

				HARRY
		Billy?  This was on Miller's
		forehead.  Any idea what it is?

				BILLY
		Nope.

	Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

				BILLY
		What did I tell you?  So fucking
		hokey.

	Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

				HARRY
		What have we got here?

	Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

	two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

	Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
	skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
	sinews straining.

				HARRY
		Grab the files!

	Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
	steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
	CLANG!

				BILLY
		Jesus!

	He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

				BILLY
		I could have lost my fucking hands.

				HARRY
		That would have kept you out of the
		Magic Circle.
			(he studies the files)
		Which was presumably the idea.
			(a beat)
		These are about Nix.

	Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

				HARRY
		You go through these.  Go on!

	Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
	PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
	painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
	There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
	-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
	that) - is NIX.

				HARRY
		Wait a minute...

	He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
	colours.

				HARRY
		That's Butterfield...

				BILLY
			(points to nan in)
		doorway)
		And who's that?

	ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

	ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

				HARRY
		At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

	Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
	a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
	of another man's HEAD.

				BILLY
		Take a look at this.

				HARRY
			(looking at it)
		A Nix specialty?

	Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series.  We
	glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
	his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
	beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
	a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
	DARKNESS.

				BILLY
		I don't know any of these tricks...

	Harry studies the etchings.

				HARRY
			(a slow burn)
		Maybe they're not tricks.

				BILLY
			(mystified)
		I mean, there's no instructions--
			(realizes what Harry said)
		What do you mean, they're not
		tricks?

				HARRY
		What did Vinovich say? Something
		about walking a path between --

				BILLY
		Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
		says that all the time.

				HARRY
		That's because he knew.  He'd seen
		these files and knew.

				BILLY
		Knew what?

	Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
	book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
	lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
	Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

	Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
	figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

	Harry takes out his gun. 

	Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
	goes after the apparition. 

	The TRACK is completely silent. 

	Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
	its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

	It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
	backs away.

				BILLY
		Harry!

	Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
	shelves.

				BILLY
		Where the fuck are you?

	Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

				HARRY
		Okay.  Hold it right there.

	The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
	of smoke. 

	Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

	But it's still terrorizing Billy.

				BILLY
			(in mortal terror)
		Get it off me!

	Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
	books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
	vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

				HARRY
		Hokey enough for you?

				BILLY
		I'm out of here, man!  Are you
		coming?

	Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

				HARRY
		I'm coming.

	Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
	to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
	gates. 

	As he does so --

	-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
	"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

				HARRY
		Ah, shaddup!

	He FIRES at the projector a second time.

	On the GUN SHOT --

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT

	Billy and Harry are parting.

				HARRY
		Thanks, Billy.

				BILLY
		Hey, anytime.
			(a beat)
		Actually, no.  This was enough. 

	They shake, and part.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

				VALENTIN
			(quietly)
		I can't let you in.

				HARRY
			(stepping in)
		Yeah, I know.

				VALENTIN
		You want more money, is that it?

	Harry pushes him aside.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

				HARRY
		Dorothea?

	He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts
	towards it.

				VALENTIN
		Leave her alone --

				HARRY
		Shut up!

	He pushes open the door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and
	memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,
	Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
	Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

				DOROTHEA
		This is the way he wanted it... no
		autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
		meddling with his body...

	Harry approaches, slowly.

				DOROTHEA
		Flesh is a trap.  That's what he
		used to say.  Flesh is a trap and
		magic sets us free.
			(a beat)
		Why did you come back?

				HARRY
		I didn't leave.  I was just digging
		around.

	Dorothea looks up at him.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		What did you find?

				HARRY
		Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
			(he watches her for a
		response)
		She threw herself in front of a car
		this afternoon.

	Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh Christ.

				HARRY
			(a beat)
		Why don't you tell me the truth?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

	Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
	PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

				HARRY
		Nix ran some kind of cult, right? 
		Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

				DOROTHEA
		It was more than that, I think.

				HARRY
		He was the real thing, right?

				DOROTHEA
		Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

				HARRY
		Stuff?

				DOROTHEA
		He could get into people's heads. 
		Make them see things. Terrible
		things.  And he could levitate. 
		Juggle fire.

				HARRY
		He taught all this to Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		Some or it.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin is listening at the door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

				HARRY
		So Swann was performing magic. not
		illusions?
			(Dorothea nods)
		And what?  You thought he should be
		using it to cure cancer, not making
		millions.

				DOROTHEA
		I told you --

				HARRY
		Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess
		that'd turn anybody's head.
		Including yours.

				DOROTHEA
		No.

				HARRY
		You said you weren't with him for
		love.

				DOROTHEA
		I wasn't.

				HARRY
		 What then?

				DOROTHEA
		I was grateful to him.  I owed him
		my life.  And he loved me. He
		couldn't always show it, but he
		felt it.

				HARRY
		He thought Nix was coming back,
		didn't he?

	Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips
	from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They
	stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost
	palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

				DOROTHEA
		Shit!

	They are very close to each other.

				HARRY
			(reassuring)
		It's okay.

				DOROTHEA
		No it isn't.  You can't help me.

				HARRY
			(tenderly)
		I'm here, aren't I?

	He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

				HARRY
		Nothing's going to happen to you.  

				DOROTHEA
			(seductive)
		Nothing?

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Nothing you don't want. 

	They kiss again, passionately.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
	the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses
	to the phone and dials.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
	flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
	Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

	It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

	INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The
	palms churn against the night sky...

	INTERCUT

	Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
	of Harry and Dorothea.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

				DOROTHEA
			(whispers)
		I was so afraid.

				HARRY
		Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you sure?

				HARRY
		I'm sure.
			(kisses her)
		He's dead.

				DOROTHEA
		I know.  I'm the one who shot
		him.

	ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

				DOROTHEA
		I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,
		to get Swann to come to him.

				HARRY
			(realizing)
		And they all came...

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Quaid and Jennifer--

				DOROTHEA
		And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was
		ready for them.

	There's a NOISE downstairs.

				DOROTHEA
			(nervous)
		What was that?

				HARRY
		It's okay. 

	Harry slips out of bed.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
	is all he wears).  He has his gun.

				HARRY
		Valentin? 

	Dorothea appears behind him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?  Wait!

	Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in
	a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail
	of clothing or face.

				HARRY
		What the hell-?

	Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of
	ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his
	skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
	skull.

				HARRY
			(in pain)
		Aah!

	Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the
	Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

				DOROTHEA
		It's him!  It's Nix!

	Harry goes out into the passageway.

				HARRY
		Valentin!  Get some lights on!

	As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
	erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
	"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
	physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
	writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
	it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
	leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
	door, and flings it open.  He's in -- 

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT     

	The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
	Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
	doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
	he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
	Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
	the CASKET.

				HARRY
		Somebody you know?

	Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and
	sweating, cornered against the casket.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God!

	The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
	supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
	gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

				HARRY
		Which goes first?  My face or
		your heart?

	The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers
	and dies.

				DOROTHEA
		Who in God's name are you?

	She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
	into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his
	exit.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you all right?

				HARRY
		Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him
		in here!

	Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders
	and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts
	to force off the lid. 

	Valentin and Dorothea enter.

				VALENTIN
		What are you doing?  This is
		sacrilege.

	He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls. 

	Inside, Swann's corpse.

				VALENTIN
		Are you satisfied now?

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
	into the corpse's mouth.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		It's all right.  It's not
		hurting...

	He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 

	-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

				HARRY
		...plaster doesn't bleed.

	He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		It looks like you're not a widow
		after all.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
	binds Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		You rigged the illusion to fail,
		right?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		You paid off the doctor.  You set
		up the fake body.  Yes?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		And then... because I was
		getting too close to something --
			(at Dorothea)
		--or someone, you called Swann

				VALENTIN
		I tried to pay you off.

				HARRY
		Was that Swann's idea?

				VALENTIN
		No.  It was mine.  I didn't want
		any more bloodshed. That's why we
		went to all this trouble, so
		there'd be no one for Nix to come
		after.

				HARRY
		Nix is dead and buried, for
		fuck's sake.

				VALENTIN
		Haven't you seen enough to know
		that doesn't matter?

	ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
	Nix's resurrection is plausible.

				HARRY
		I want to see Swann face to face.

				VALENTIN
		Why don't you leave this alone? Let
		everybody think it's over?

				DOROTHEA
		What about me?

				VALENTIN
		Nix was never interested in you. 
		It was always Swann. 

	A beat.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Maybe Valentin's right.  We should
		let it alone. 

	A BELL starts to TOLL-

				HARRY
			(con't.)
		He went to all that trouble to be
		dead.  Maybe we should let him stay
		that way.

	The TOLLING carries over into

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
	MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
	Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
	amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
	Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
	Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
	the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
	to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

	Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
	from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
	she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
	condolesence.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
	are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
	in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially
	dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 

	Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
	"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
	down into the street.

				1ST WORKER
		Watch out!

	On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. 
	We don't see who.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
	cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit. 

	Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY

	The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car. 

	On Harry, as he gets into his.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

				VALENTIN
		Who's there?

	He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. 
	He swings round.  Too late.

	Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin
	to the ground.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(conversationally)
		I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
		another profession, I would have
		been a surgeon.

	On Valentin, staring up in terror. 

	Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
	the scalpel glittering.

				BUTTERFIELD
		To be able to heal with one little
		cut.

	On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
	just beneath his eye.

				VALEMTIN
		No. . .

				BUTTERFIELD
		Let's say those eyes of yours were
		giving you trouble.

				VALENTIN
		Please.

				BUTTERFIELD
		I could scoop them out.

				VALENTIN
		Don't.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So tell me where Nix is buried.

				VALENTIN
		I don't know.

	Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. 

	CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
	Butterfield's body.

				VALENTIN
		Wait!

	On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
	that's all.

				VALENTIN
		I'll tell you.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You'll do more.than that.

	EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

	A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
	Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
	barbed wire.  He peers through the bars. 

	Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
	into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
	get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

	Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
	inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
	wire.

	INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY		   

	It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards
	are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. 
	Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies. 

	Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
	the Stranger. 

	He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

	As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
	GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

	INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

	Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
	fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
	equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing. 

	Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

				HARRY
		I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
		away.

	Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
	operating table.

				HARRY
		You had to see who wept for you the
		most.

	Silence.

				HARRY
		A lot of people are going to be
		really pissed off when they
		discover you're still alive.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		They'll never find out. 

	Harry looks up.

	Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his
	temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of
	concentration.

				HARRY
		Look, Ma, no wires.

				SWANN
		You shouldn't have followed me,
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		How the fuck do you do that?

				SWANN
		Now I'm going to have to kill you.

				HARRY
		I don't think so.  You need me
		alive.

				SWANN
		Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

	Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

				HARRY
		Be careful.  Funerals make me
		trigger-happy.

	Swann stops, inches from the ground.

				HARRY
		You know, it's such a fucking
		waste.  You can do shit most of us
		can only dream about, and you go
		around pretending it's some trick.

				SWANN
		Illusionists get. Las Vegas
		contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get
		burned.

				HARRY
		Or murdered, like Nix.

				SWANN
		He deserved it.

				HARRY
		Maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
		Maybe he's digging his
		way out of the hole you put him
		right now.  That's what you're
		hiding away from, isn't it?

				SWANN
		I did it for Dorothea.

				HARRY
		Oh yeah?

				SWANN
		Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
		off her.

	Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
	they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his
	posturing, is afraid.

				HARRY
		So Nix won't come looking for her?

				SWANN
		It's me betrayed him.

				HARRY
		And she shot him I  I think that'd
		piss me off if I were Nix.

				SWANN
			(despairing)
		I don't know what else to do.

				HARRY
		Help me.

	On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

				HARRY
		Listen.  If he's back from the
		dead, then he is some kind of god. 
		And he'll find you, wherever the
		fuck you are. 
		And if he's just another phony
		Messiah, then you can stage the
		greatest come-back in history.

	ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
	are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. 
	SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

	We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
	several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely
	suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

	We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
	A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We
	see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
	floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

	Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
	Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman
	grins.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into
	the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
	the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
	brandy.

				SWANN
		Is this the best brandy you've
		got?

				CASHIER
		If that's what's on the shelves.

	Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

				SWANN
		Can you change a thousand for me?

				CASHIER
			(amazed)
		You're shittin' me.

				HARRY
		Can we go?

	Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

				HARRY
		Oh Jeez.

				SWANN
		Will that do?  No?

	Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of
	QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

				SWANN
		That better? 

	The Cashier gapes.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK

	The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN
	struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

				SHOCK CUT TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 

	CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
	crazed. 

	Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
	shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD
	runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

	NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
	falling gouts of dark fluid --

	-- she struggles, SOBBING --
			 CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She tosses around on the bed

				BACK TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it
	from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
	SPLASHES on her upturned face --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets
	up and goes out onto --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK

	Looks down the stairs.

				DOROTHEA
		Who's there?

	Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry.

	BLOOD runs from his cut face.

				DOROTHEA
		Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do
		to your face?

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		It was me.

	She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
	against the wail.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Guess who we're going to see?

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK

	Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he
	stares at Harry.

				SWANN
		You think I'm an asshole.

				HARRY
		Didn't know you read minds.

				SWANN
			(a warning)
		I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. 
		But you know that.
			(an apology)
		So I like playing games with
		people.  Gives them something to
		wonder about...

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		I distract them from their banality
		for a few minutes. It's like a
		public service.  It doesn't mean
		much in the end. They're all going
		to die.

				HARRY
		And you're not? 

	Silence for a moment.

				SWANN
		Oh, I was going to discover the
		secret of the universe.  That's why
		I liked Nix.  He promised me all
		these explanations.

				HARRY
		And he didn't have them?

				SWANN
		He had something.  He showed me how
		to bend the rules.  A little
		levitation.  A few fireworks.

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		No.
			(a beat)
		At the end... when we had him
		cornered, he got into my head. He
		showed me what we really look like,
		when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. 
		Shit...

				HARRY
		And you believed him?

				SWANN
		I saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
		See, that's his best trick.  No
		illusions.  Just the truth.
			(he looks at Harry)
		Are you ready for that? 

	Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

				SWANN
		Hey!

	Harry drinks.

				SWANN
		Thought not.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT

	PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
	door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.

				HARRY
		Dorothea?

	Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

				SWANN
		She's not here.

	Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

				HARRY
		Did she know where Nix was buried?

				SWANN
		No.

				HARRY
		Who else did?  Did Valentin?

				SWANN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Jesus!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT	 

	Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
	stars.

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT       

	Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. 
	Dorothea is handcuffed. 

	He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a
	series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,
	confounded.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Like the look of these?  I made
		them myself, to set him free.

				DOROTHEA
		Why did you wait so long?

				BUTTERFIELD
		I didn't have the skill to
		resurrect him.  I had to teach
		myself.  And that took time.

				DOROTHEA
		And you think he'll be in a fit
		state to resurrect, after thirteen
		years?

				BUTTERFIELD
		If he was just a man like me, then
		no.  But he's not.

				DOROTHEA
		What is he?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Maybe he'll show you.

	ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
	Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

	There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

	It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
	We DRIFT towards the front door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

	Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
	CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
	blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
	indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
	eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
	ears and scalps.

	And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

				NORMAN
		He will come!  He will come! He
		will come!

	EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 

	The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
	illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 

	ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
	watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Anything?

				VALENTIN (V.0.)
		Not yet.

	Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
	reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

				BUTTERFIELD
		If you've lied to me to me --

				VALENTIN
		I swear... this is the place Swann
		told me about.  The rocks...

	On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
	steps back towards the open car door. 

	Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
	Valentin.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Five more minutes.  Hear me? And
		you'd better not --

	A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground
	beside the open car door, the instruments.

				BUTTERFIELD
		What the fuck are you playing at?

	He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the
	door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him. 
	Opens a WOUND across his arm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
	hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.
	Twice.  Then --

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		Butterfield!

	Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
	flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

				VALENTIN
			(blinded)
		In the corner...

	The beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

	A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Valentin)
		Keep away from it.

	Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
	The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. 
	He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

	Closer... 

	Closer... 

	He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
	ROAR!

	He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
	mask rolls into view.

				VALENTIN
		Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(reverentially)
		It's him... it's him.

	On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	The car is static; the engine still running.

				HARRY
		They got here before us.

				SWANN
		Looks that way.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

	HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE

	Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers
	in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight. 
	Harry slides into the grave.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try
	and scramble out.

				HARRY
		Swann?  Swann!

	Silence.

	Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings
	round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up. 

				VALENTIN
		D'Amour --

				HARRY
		Shit...

				VALENTIN
		Help me.

	He collapses into Harry's arms.

				HARRY
		Swann!

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not
	to help?

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Swann!

	He decides.  Gets out.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT

	Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

				HARRY
		Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

	Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
	lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

				VALENTIM
		He's got Dorothea. 

				SWANN
		And Nix?

				VALENTIN
		Him too.

				HARRY
		We've got to get you to a hospital.

				VALENTIN
		Don't bother.

				HARRY
		Shut up.  We've lost enough lives
		already.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry, D'Amour...

				HARRY
		What about?

				VALENTIN
		... Looks like you're going...
		to lose... one more.

	Valentin dies.

				HARRY
			(despairing)
		... no...

				SWANN
		He's better off this way.

				HARRY
			(furious)
		Nobody's better off this wav!

				SWANN
		You don't get it, do you? We're
		shit. D'Amour.

	He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into
	Nix's grave.

				SWANN
		That's where we're all going.

				HARRY
		In my time, and nobody else's.

	ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
	getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS
	retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The house is silent now.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
	them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

	ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
	WHITE now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Do you wish him to be amongst us?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Will you come to him on your
		knees?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Be ready.

	Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
	With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
	bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
	MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
	sharp pieces of GLASS. 

	ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
	BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
	Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
	head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

	ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
	she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
	into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

				DOROTHEA
		Listen.  You've got everything you
		want.  You don't need me. .. 

	A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
	POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
	We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
	occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
	signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

				BUTTERFIELD
		No, but he will.  After what you
		did to him.

	He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS
		that.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,
	breathless with anticipation.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

	On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her. 

	And Nix DRAWS BREATH. 

	On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The whisper runs through the congregation:

				CULTISTS
		He's coming home... he/s coming
		home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

				DOROTHEA
		Christ in Heaven.

	ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
	His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
	THROB. 

	Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
	move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
	still screwed over his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				CULTISTS
		He's with us... He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
	gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
	TRACK. 

	Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
	coiled around his face and fingers!

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

	Butterfield looks up. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Hold her!

	On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
	comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see
	his eyes.

	NIX'S P.O.V.

	The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

				NIX
			(fury to agony)
		Aaarrrgh!

	He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
	all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
	ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
	him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
	display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
	literally ROARS in rage.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
	repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the
	shards of glass now, crazed.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
	getting out.  Swann stays put. 

	The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

				HARRY
			(spooked)
		Jesus... what the hell's going on
		in there?

				SWANN
		At a guess... they just resurrected
		him.

				HARRY
		Fuck.

	Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
	of the car and follows.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out
	for the count. 

	On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely
	disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. 

	The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

				NIX
		Children...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

				NIX
		Will you suffer to come unto me?

	One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
	flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
	agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

	Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

				NIX
		I've come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave.  Will you hear it?

				CULTISTS
		Yes... yes...

				NIX
		Follow me then.

	He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
	adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

				NIX
		Do I know you, child?

	He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
	keeps her self-possession; but only just.

				NIX
		Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun
		this time, child?
			(a beat)
		Where's Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where he is.

	Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


				NIX
		He'll come.  We've got unfinished
		business, he and I.

	Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
	Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
	wounds he's receiving. 

	The Cultists follow.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Nix strides into the middle of the room.

				NIX
			(whispered to Dorothea)
		Something terrible's going to
		happen.  But if you hold on to me,
		very tight, you may live a little
		longer.

	The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		Are you ready for my wisdom?

				CULTISTS
		Tell us... tell us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
	He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

	ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
	terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of
	the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

				SWANN
			(in terrified awe)
		This is where we killed him.

				HARRY
			(looking at table)
		You didn't try hard enough.

				SWANN
		I can't... I can't go any
		further...

	Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
	grip.  He crosses to the door. 

	Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
	catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

	He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
	Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

				NIX
		Here is my wisdom.

	He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all
	directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
	power.

				BARBARA
		Show us. Puritan.

				NORMAN
		Yes, show us!

				ALL
		Show us!  Show us!

	With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
	Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;
	perhaps bottomless. 

	Dorothea SCREAMS!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
	passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
	ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches
	hold of his arm.

				SWANN
			(to Harry)
		Whatever he's doing to her, stop
		him!

	And Harry's up and away --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	-- he dashes over the glass --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he
	floats over the chasm below then.

				NIX
			(to unseen Cultists)
		You see, I escaped the grave. So I
		have to give something to the grave
		in return.

	On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes. 

	A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
	REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
	Cultists.

	At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

				NORMAN
		What's happening?

				NIX
		I have to give something back. So
		I'm giving you.

	They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
	They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

				BARBARA
			(sobbing)
		Why?  Why?

				NIX
		You're not worthy.  None of you. 
		Only Swann was worthy. You just
		waited like lambs.

	Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to Harry.

				NIX
		Well I'm not your shepherd.

	Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
	is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
	ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
	and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
	gaze.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
	They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
	resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
	is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time. 

	The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

				SWANN
		Aah!

				BUTTERFIELD
		Go on, bleed.
			(he slashes at Swann
		again)
		Go on!  Go on!

	Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
	wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
	the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(screaming)
		No!

	He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
	running from his wound.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the
	pit now. 

	Nix swings round.

				NIX
		You're not Swann.  Who are you?
			(a beat) )
		Oh... I know what you want. He lets
		Dorothea slip from his arms.  

	Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
	Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
	goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
	leading to the passageway.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

				HARRY
		Hang on!

	Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
	contact

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Nix!

	Nix looks up.

				NIX
		There you are. 

	Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.

				NIX
		I've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  Where I went wrong...

	With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
	chasm.

				SWANN
		And?

				NIX
		I should have been honest with you,
		right from the start.  I wasn't
		born to show people the error of
		their ways.  I was born to murder
		the world.

	ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
	back into the room.

				NIX
		You could still help me do that.

				SWANN
		Why would I want to?

				NIX
		Because you've got nothing else to
		live for.

				SWANN
		Not true.

				NIX
		The woman has a new love in her
		life.  Your friends are dead.
		Nobody's left to save you, but me

	He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		I've got to help him.

				DOROTHEA
		You can't.

				HARRY
		Nix has got to have a weak spot. 
		Everybody's got a fucking weak
		spot.

	A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

	Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Bastard!

	He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
	BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
	Passageway. 

	Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

				NIX
		Will you help me? 

	A beat.  Then Swann nods.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Nix lets him go.

				NIX
		You know I'll kill you when we're
		done.  I have to.

				SWANN
		Yes.

				NIX
		But until then... it's you and
		me... the way it always was.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

				NIX
		Wait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?

				SWANN
		No!

				NIX
		Liar!

	Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

				NIX
		Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

	With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
	They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
	one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
	Dorothea.

				NIX
		She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
		I'll show you!

	He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
	broken.

				SWANN
		Harry!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Harry!  Stop him!

	Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
	the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

	Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

				NIX (V.O.)
		Where is she? 

	Harry turns.

	Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
	body as he comes at Harry!

				NIX
		Where did she go?

	Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
	fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
	struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

	Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
	temples.  As before, there's no blood.

				NIX
		You've got Swann's disease. You
		think a little courage, a little
		love, and it'll all be all right. 
		Wrong!

	His fingers slide all the way in!

				HARRY
		Oh God!

	Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
	are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

				NIX
		Tell me where she is... and I'll
		make it go away...

	Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
	SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

	ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

				HARRY
		Oh God... oh God...

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
	some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
	face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer.

	ON HARRY

	as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
	Reaching out for the image.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The Woman reaches for Harry.

				WOMAN           
		Help me.

	ON HARRY

	as he touches the wall.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!

	He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
	painted.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!  Dorothea!

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
	screaming when she disappears.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	ON HARRY 

	literally beating his head against the wall!

				HARRY
		No!  No!  No!

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry...

	Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

				DOROTHEA
		It's not real, Harry-

	Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

	ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck. 

	ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
		good between us, believe it.

	Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
	fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


				HARRY
		... oh... God...

				DOROTHEA
		I'm here, Harry.

				HARRY
		...yes?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

	Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

				NIX
			(to Dorothea)
		There you are, child. 

	Harry starts to look round.

				DOROTHEA
		Don't look.

				HARRY
		I... have... to.

				NIX
		Come on, child.  I want Swann to
		see you die. 

	Harry turns and looks at Nix.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
	of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

				NIX
			(to Harry)
		What are you looking at?

	ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
	and now slips inside. 

	ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

	ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
	hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

				HARRY
			(points to his brow)
		There... there!

	ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

	ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

	The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
	BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
	used to be.

	ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
	wall, shaking.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		I'm okay.  I'm okay.

	Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
	actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
	embrace. 

	Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

	-- it isn't over. 

	One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
	kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
	up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
	forehead --

				NIX
		One... last... illusion...

	-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God.

	Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 

	Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
	stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
	utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

				SWANN (V.O.)
		... D'Amour...

	Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
	Swann is on the threshold. 

	Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

	He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
	the Meditation Room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
	backed towards it by Nix. 

	When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
	DEMONIACAL.

				NIX
		I am the purest of the pure.  I am
		the darkest of the dark...

	Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

				SWANN
		Harry.  You can't kill him. 

	Harry crouches beside Swann.

				HARRY
			(whispers)
		He did something with the ground.

				SWANN
		Yes?

				HARRY
		Can you do it?

				SWANN
		I don't know.

				HARRY
		Try.

	ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

				NIX (V.O.)
		I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
		Hell.

	Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
	Nix topples.

	ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

	A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
	broken fingers -- 

	-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
	corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
	resurfacing --

	Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Get out of here!

	The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
	around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
	Harry, of course. 

	Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
	him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

				NIX
		No!  No!  No!

	He's at the edge of the pit.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

	Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
	reaches for Harry, as -- 

	-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

	Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
	They look back to see 

	NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

	At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
	closes his eyes.

				CUT TO:

	INT. THE PIT

	What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
	death by any villain in the history of cinema... 

	Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
	against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
	smithereens.  And as he falls --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Is it finished?

				HARRY
		I think so.

	No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
	layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
	earth. 

	And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
	approaching MAGMA.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Come on...

	She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with
	relief.

	INT. THE PIT

	Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
	disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
	spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				HARRY
		What the fuck? 

				DOROTHEA
		Harry-?

				HARRY
		Out!  Out! 

	They race for the front door --

	INT. THE PIT

	-- the wave of ENERGY, like a howling, dark WIND, ascends at
	a breath-taking rate

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	Harry and Dorothea race for the open air, as

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The ENERGY ERUPTS from the pit.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry and Dorothea stumble out, into the night --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	The ENERGY howls from room to room, ERODING the images off
	the walls, BLOWING out the doors, DESTROYING all the
	resurrection equipment in the Sanctum --

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

	Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the
	house, as the cacophony of destruction dies down. 

	ON THE RIM OF THE SUN, as it peeps over the desert horizon.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN

	The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN

	The hole in the floor CLOSES UP, and is SEALED... SILENCE
	reigns.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN

	Harry and Dorothea get into the car.  Harry glances back at
	the house.  Nothing.

				HARRY
			(quietly)
		It's finished.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - IDOLS - DAWN

	ON THE IDOLS and the FRONT DOOR, virtually destroyed by tine.

	WE DRIFT THROUGH THEM, INTERCUTTING WITH:

	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - DESERT ROAD - DAWN			   

	Harry's car speeds away, leaving a plume of dust as

	THE CREDITS ROLL
TITLE SEQUENCE


	As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:


	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY


	A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
	surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS."  Like modern demons. 
	Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
	their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
	broken glass teeth.

	EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY

	Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
	flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
	of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
	sand and heat.

	END CREDITS.

				CUT WIDE TO;

	EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY

	A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
	make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
	Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. 
	The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
	SCREEN, the words:  '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY

	We're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
	sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
	scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
	narrows his eyes.

	BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.

	The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
	house.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(softly)
		Swann...?

	He turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
	whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY

	The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
	become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
	scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
	helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY

	A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. 
	They watch Nix in adoration. 

	As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...

				NIX
		And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix,
		you're my instrument. From now on,
		you'll be called the Puritan...

				CULTISTS
			(murmuring)
		Puritan...

	NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

	Butterfield enters. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Master?

	Nix looks up.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Swann's here. 

	Nix rises, smiling.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		We'll come back to this. Get about
		your business. 

	As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
	SOBBING.

				NIX
		Hush...

	Nix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
	mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.

				NIX
		I said hush.

				GIRL
		Please.  Let me go.

	From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. 
	Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal.

				NIX
			(to Baboon)
		What is it?

	The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.

				NIX
			(to Girl)
		I think he's in love.

	He unshackles the Baboon.  The animal pads toward the Girl,
	trailing its chain.

				GIRL
		Keep it away from me.

	Nix catches hold of its chain.  Holds it back.  The Baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
	catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.

				GIRL
		Please... please...

	Nix watches her terror dispassionately.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		Want me to shoot Swann?

				NIX
		You don't like him, do you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		He wants your magic.

				NIX
		Maybe.  Go fetch him.

	Butterfield exits.  Nix advances on the Girl.

				GIRL
		What are you going to do?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY

	The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.

	From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  He's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
	studious and intense.  From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
	skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
	steely gaze.

				SWANN
			(to all three)
		Are we ready?

				JENNIFER
			(cool)
		Say the word.

				PIMM
			(very nervous)
		Look, maybe we should think this over.

	On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of METALWORK.  We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.

				SWANN
		No.  He's gone too far.

				PIMM
		So he took a child.

				JENNIFER
		He'll kill her.

				PIMM
		No he won't.

				SWANN
			(determined)
		He's not going to get the chance.

	Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

				QUAID
		If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

				SWANN
		So stay out here.

	Swann starts towards the House.  Jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

	Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's expecting you.

	Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.

				SWANN
			(to others)
		Look around.  If you find 'the
		child, yell.  She's got blonde
		hair, that's all I know.

	Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself.  Swann follows
	him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY

	Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
	(three men and two women) still sit.  One of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.

				1ST MAN
		Hey, Quaid.  I thought you said you
		weren't coming back.

				QUAID
		I changed my mind.

				1ST WOMAN
		Come and join us.

	She smiles a crazy smile.  Reaches out for Quaid.  A SNAKE
	appears from around the back of her neck.  Quaid recoils. 

	And now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  In the
	Cultists' clothes and hair.  Even on the baby.  Quaid turns
	away.  And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  He strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.

				SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
			(angry)
		Don't do that!

	The Snake-Handler gets up.  Quaid retreats from the door. 
	Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.

	INT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   "BEDROOM"   -  DAY

	Jennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where
	a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.

				JENNIFER
		Don't be afraid.

	The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth
	pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl,
	of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.

				BARBARA
		I'm not... want to see?

	She pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into
	her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
	retreats to the door, and exits back out into --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
	is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
	his white-knuckled fingers.

				PIMM
		He's going to kill us all...

				JENNIFER
		Where did Swann go?

	Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
	his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. 
	He turns the door handle.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Swann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The
	folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a
	muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. 

	On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As
	he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!

	He reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half
	dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. 

	Swann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
	passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.

				QUAID

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
	struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.

				SWANN
		You're going to be okay.

	Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her
	face.  Swann turns.

				NIX
		I knew you'd come. 

	He reaches down to Swann.

				NIX
		I've got so much power to give
		you, Swann.  All you have to do
		is...beg.

				SWANN
		Fuck you.

				NIX
		You don't think I've got it to
		give?

				SWANN
		No!

	Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
	gravity.

				NIX
		You're wrong.

	He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
	against the wall.

				NIX
		I could eat your fucking soul,
		Swann.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps
	from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
	hand.  BLOOD SPURTS.

				JENNIFER
		Fuck!

	She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

				NIX
		You want to know what the world
		really looks like?

	Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. 

	And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

				NIX
		Want to see flesh with a god's
		eyes?

	Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
	Sanctum door.  Jennifer is at Quaid's side.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Aah!

				QUAID
		Get away from the door!

	Butterfield shakes his head.  Quaid FIRES.  The bullet.
	strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head.  He retreats,
	growling like a rabid animal.  Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
	open, and enters.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

				QUAID
		Swann?

				NIX
			(to Quaid)
		Here he is.

	Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
	eyes blood-red.

				NIX
		Take a look, Swann!  These are your
		friends.

	On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
	Jennifer.

				JENNIFER (V.O.)
		What have you done to him? 

SWANN'S P.O.V.

	of Quaid and Jennifer.  To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be MORPHING.  Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  PRIMEVAL MUCK.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Swann.  It's okay.

	Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.

				SWANN
		Don't touch me.  He's got... got
		into my head.

				NIX
		You want to be like that, Swann? 
		Mud and shit?

	Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.

	SWANN'S P.O.V. 

	of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  His face has an
	aura of pulsing light.

				NIX
		Come here.  Share the power.

	ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom.  The trigger is
	pulled. 

	The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	ON SWANN, staring at Nix. 

	SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
	something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features.  A NIGHTMARE
	FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	Swann covers his eyes.

				NIX
			(raging, terrifying)
		Swann!  Swann!

	Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the WOUND.  As he falls, he reveals the
	ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.

				NIX
			(a roar)
		Help me!

	Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
	control.

				SWANN
		Jesus-

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY

	Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.

				1ST CULTIST
			(with distressing
		confidence)
		You can't kill him.

				2ND CULTIST
		He'll just rise up again!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	On Nix, doing just that:  rising up.  Right hand clamped to
	his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.

				NIX
		Help me!

	Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder.  And again. 
	Strikes his leg.  Nix collapses to the ground,

				JENNIFER
		Quickly!

	They have come prepared for this.  Swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK.  There are
	SCREWS in then all.

				NIX
			(seeing)
		Swann?  What are you doing?

				SWANN
		Binding you.

	He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an
	eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs
	from the screw-holes.

				NIX
		Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you!

	Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.

				NIX
		Sw

	He's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	Swann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? 

	And now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

				GIRL
			(quietly)
		Is it finished?

				SWANN
		It's finished.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
	had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat,
	their confidence and courage gone. 

	Pimm steps into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY

	The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
	body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl.

				PIMM
		Dead?

				QUAID
		Dead.

				PIMM
		What now?

				SWANN
		We bury him so deep no one will
		ever find him.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK

	The wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield
	dashes towards camera, then halts. 

	HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
	into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. 

	ON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face.

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY

	The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
	gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
	some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and
	congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.

	ON SCREEN, the words:  "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY

	The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
	a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
	it has a certain charm.

	INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

	A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
	host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
	At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
	HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty
	but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
	name.

				BLONDE GIRL
		How'd you spell that again?

				HARRY
		D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry
		D'Amour.

				BLONDE GIRL
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
		Isn't that French for something?

	ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Yeah.  It's French.

				BLONDE GIRL
		For love, right?

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

				HARRY
			(to Blonde)
		Right.

				BLONDE GIRL
			(grinning)
		That's so cool.

				BELLBOY
		Mister D'Amour?

	Harry turns.  He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-
	shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  He's
	handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

				HARRY
		Yeah?

				BELLBOY
		You haven't paid the cab.  He won't
		give us your bags 'til you pay him.

				HARRY
		How much?

				BELLBOY
		Thirty-five bucks.

				HARRY
		Tell him he can keep them. The
		Bellboy looks puzzled.

				HARRY
		Just kidding.

	Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
	bills.

				HARRY
		I've got my life in there.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	On the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  Harry flings it
	open.  Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
	of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  A GUN.  A
	CRUCIFIX.  A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
	destruction. 

	ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom.  Turns on the
	shower.  Starts to undress.

	EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK

	Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
	sun.  Squints.  Puts on sunglasses.

				HARRY
		Hello, L.A.

				BELLBOY
		Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

				HARRY
		You bet.

	EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
	classy restaurant.  It's RAINING.
	ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
	WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
	Tapert makes a joke (unheard).  The woman laughs. 

	ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
	recorder.

				HARRY
		Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either
		got a great sense of humour or he's
		paying her to laugh.
			(looks at hamburger in
		disgust)
		Jesus.

	On Tapert, as he rises from the table.

				HARRY
			(into tape recorder)
		He's finished.

	Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
	tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.

	EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

	Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
	up and gets in.

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT

	He turns the key in the ignition.

				CUT  TO:

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT

	In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  It
	reads:  TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL

	ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
	door beside the store window. 

	WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
	side of the street. 

	Harry gets out of the car.  Stares at the sign in the window,
	puzzled.

				HARRY
		Superstitious?

	He starts across the street.  Suddenly:

				TAPERT (V.O.)
		Oh my God!

	Tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  He stumbles to
	his car, and he's away.  Harry freezes, caught between the
	need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
	latter, and steps inside.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs.  Harry ascends,
	past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.

	At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
	halts, and takes out his GUN. 

	There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
	corner.  Harry chances a look.  There's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  From the threshold a
	CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED.  This is
	the source of the rumbling.  Harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	Dead silence.  After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
	door.  He pushes it open.  Inside, chaos.  The fake antique
	FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	There are two offices.  In the front, a Waiting Room, into
	which Harry now steps.  Beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room. 

	From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.

				QUAID (V.O.)
		Ahh. . .

	Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
	shadows. 

	His name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
	and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. 

	Miller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the
	Fortune Telling Room.

				MILLER
		Fuckhead.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a
	table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
	tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude
	from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the
	table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.

	Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

				HARRY
		What the fuck!?

	Harry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the
	door.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. 

	As he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A
	FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. 
	His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.

				HARRY
			(to Butterfield)
		Don't touch him."

	Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs
	in pain. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		What are you going to do about it? 

	Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Harry)
		Ever watched a man die?  If you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		And if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.

				QUAID
		Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
		there.  Ask Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared.  They knew the Puritan
		was coming home. 

	As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
	side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of
	defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  Behind it a WINDOW.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So do you.  You've seen the future. 
		Haven't you?

				QUAID
		Yes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		And are you afraid?

				QUAID
		Yes.

	Suddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller
	CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
	against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
	around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. 

	Butterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
	belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
	which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. 

	Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  Harry starts after him.

				QUAID
			(to Harry)
		Don't leave me.

	He turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
	goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
	stairs.


				HARRY
		You need an ambulance.

				QUAID
			(in pain)
		Too late.  Why are you here? Did
		you cone... up here for a reading? 

	Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		NO ... I...

	Quaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily
	forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers.

				QUAID
			(quietly)
		My God.

				HARRY
		What?

				QUAID
		You've taken some strange
		journeys in your life.

				HARRY
		Yeah.  You could say that.

				QUAID
		You're drawn to the dark side, over
		and over.  And it's drawn to you.
			(looks at Harry)
		You don't like that.

				HARRY
		Not much.

				QUAID
		You can't change it.  You have to
		walk...
			(coughs)
		...walk the line between Heaven and
		Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept
		it.

	Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in
	pain.

				HARRY
		Hold on.

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

				HARRY
		The Puritan?

				QUAID
		Yes...

				HARRY
		Who is he? 

	Quaid shudders, and dies.

				HARRY
			(softly; sadly)
		Shit.

	He looks away, down at the CARDS.  All have been turned over
	but ONE.  He turns it.  The card is the Ten of Swords which
	pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
	all ten swords.  An image of death and desolation.

	EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT

	The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
	DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
	blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry.  He's midway
	through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
	OFFICERS examining the drapes.  We can't yet see the body.

				EDDISON
			(to Harry)
		What were you doing up there?

				HARRY
		I'm a private detective.  I was
		hired to follow somebody for a few
		days.  A guy called Tapert.
		Insurance fraud.

				EDDISON
			(writing)
		Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert,
		Butterfield.

				HARRY
		Tapert's got nothing to do with
		this.  He came here to get his palm
		read.

				EDDISON
		What makes you so sure?

				HARRY
			(shrugs)
		I got a file on him two inches
		thick.  He's a petty fraudster.
		This is something else.  Ever heard
		of someone called the Puritan?

				EDDISON
		New one on me.
			(to Officer)
		Okay.  Let's see him.

	OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
	GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.

				EDDISON
		Where the fuck is he?

				HARRY
		He got up and walked.

				EDDISON
			(looking up at window)
		After that fall?. He must have
		broken half his bones.

	WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.

				HARRY
		I don't think he'd have given a
		shit.

				CUT TO:

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The rooms are spartan.  Nothing on the walls.  Nothing on the
	floors.  Very little furniture. 

	Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
	long hair.  There is something feminine about him now:  his
	voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  If we didn't guess it
	already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

	Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
	out of his torso.  It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

				BUTTERFIELD
		D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know
		that name?

				MILLER
		I know him.  I saw him.

	He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
	sighing with pleasure.

				MILLER
		I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got
		possessed and he saved the little
		bastard's life.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's a priest?

				MILLER
		No.  He's just a guy who's got a
		nose for this shit.
			(a beat.  A smirk)
		Like you.

	A long beat of silence.  Butterfield combs.  Miller digs for
	glass.

				BUTTERFIELD 
		I don't want him getting in the
		way.

				MILLER
		He won't. 

	Another silence.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(dreamily)
		We've all of us waited too long to
		have the homecoming spoiled.

				MILLER
		What do you mean, "all of us?"

				BUTTERFIELD
		You didn't think it was just going
		to be you and me?  A lot of people
		believed in Nix. They haven't
		forgotten his promise.

				MILLER
		About?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Death.

				MILLER
		What about death?

				BUTTERFIELD

		It's an illusion.

	beneath, and on to the name "Harry D'Amour." 

	ON SWANN, pensive as he studies the paper.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
			(softly)
		Hey... 

	He looks up, startled.

	DOROTHEA The sun's shining out there. Dorothea is dressed in
	a white robe now.  She literally brings light into this
	gloomy room.  On the shelves behind Swann are a number of art
	brut figurines, vaguely recalling the idols outside Nix's
	"temple."

				DOROTHEA
		Bad show last night?

				SWANN
			(wearily)
		The usual.  Full house. Standing
		ovation.  I tell them it's magic...

				DOROTHEA
			(distastefully)
		... they believe you.

				SWANN
		Yeah.
			(a beat)
		Remember Quaid?

				DOROTHEA
		Sure.

				SWANN
		Somebody killed him.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God.

				SWANN
			(disturbed)
		I just saw him.

	A difficult silence.  Then Swann crosses to the door.

				SWANN
		I'm putting in a new illusion
		tonight.  Will you be there?

				DOROTHEA
		Sure.  You want me to find out
		about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?

				SWANN
		No.
			(superstitiously)
		I'm not going near him.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - DAY

	VALENTIN is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in Swann's
	collection:  a huge, framed POSTER from a late nineteenth
	century magic spectacular.  Valentin is fifty or so, his gray
	hair combed back close to his scalp. Immaculately dressed in
	a distinctively European fashion.  Precise.  Cautious. 
	Elegant. 

	He orders the TWO PICTURE-HANGERS in a clipped fashion.

				VALENTIN
		Higher.  Another inch.  The left
		hand side's too low.

	Dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

				DOROTHEA
		Valentin?

				VALENTIN
			(to Hangers)
		Good.  There.
			(to Dorothea)
		Yes?

				DOROTHEA
			(gives him the newspaper)
		You saw this?

	Valentin nods.  They walk back through the house together,
	while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.

				DOROTHEA
		I want you to find this man D'Amour
		for me.

	She passes the newspaper to Valentin.  He looks down at it.
	ON NEWSPAPER.  

	C.U. of Harry's blurred PICTURE.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Harry is sprawled on the bed, in his under shorts.  A shaft of
	sun darts between the drapes, missing his face by inches. 

	Somebody is knocking on the door, hard.

				HARRY
			(waking)
		What...?

	He rolls over.  The sun strikes his eyes.  He winces.

				HARRY
		Shit.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		Mr. D'Amour?

				HARRY
		Go away.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		It's one in the afternoon.

				HARRY
		What are you, my mother?

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		I need to speak to you, Mr.
		D'Amour.  About last night.

	Harry gets up and stumbles to the door.  He opens it a
	little.  The face of VALENTIN is visible through the crack.

				HARRY
		Whatever I said, I didn't mean it,
		okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --

				VALENTIN
		We've never met.

				HARRY
		Then what do you want?

				VALENTIN
		I'm here to offer you a job.

				HARRY
		I'm going back to New York in--
			(consults his watch)
		Shit!  I'm outta here.

				VALENTIN
		Have you got a job that'll pay you
		five thousand a day?

	A beat.  Then Harry takes the chain off the door.

				HARRY
		Do I get lunch?

	Harry is eating a burrito and sipping coffee.

				HARRY
		Whose is the car?

				VALENTIN
		Mine.

				HARRY
		Nah.  You're driving it too
		carefully.

				VALENTIN
			(sparring)
		Maybe I just bought it.

				HARRY
		Somebody's been smoking in here for
		months.

	He pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt.

				HARRY
		Havanas.  You're not the
		smoker.  So who is?

				VALENTIN
			(laughs)
		You could almost pass for a
		detective, D'Amour.
			(a beat)
		I work for the best illusionist in
		the world.

				HARRY
		Philip Swann?

				VALENTIN
		You know of him?

				HARRY
		I saw him in Vegas once.

				VALENTIN
		Are you a gambling man?

				HARRY
		When I can afford to lose. Swann's
		quite a magician.

				VALENTIN
		Never call him that.  He's strictly
		an illusionist.

				HARRY
		What's the difference?

				VALENTIN
		Illusions are trickery. Magicians
		do it for real.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - GATES - DAY

	The sedan turns into a driveway.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	The sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white
	marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large
	mausoleum.

				HARRY
		Any movie stars buried here?

				VALENTIN
		Probably.

				HARRY
		It's not a bad place.  Warm.
		Great view.

				VALENTIN
		I don't think the dead much care.

				HARRY
		Are you sure?

				VALENTIN
		Are you a believer, then?

	Valentin gives him an inquisitive look.

				HARRY
		I've signed on for them all in my
		time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't
		have too many saviours.

	Harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman
	in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She
	wears a wide-brimmed hat.

				HARRY
		Who is she?

				VALENTIN
		Swann's wife.

				CUT TO:

	VALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He
	glances up. 

	Harry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in
	conversation.

				DOROTHEA
		I want you to help me help my
		husband.  I know he's in some kind
		of trouble.  And it's something to
		do with the man you saw murdered.

				HARRY
		Did your husband know Quaid?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.  They weren't close, but they
		saw each other once in a while.  I
		think Philip believes all that
		stuff with the tarot cards.

				HARRY
		You don't?

				DOROTHEA
		I think we make our own futures.

	Harry makes an approving MURMUR.

				HARRY
		What's the connection?

				DOROTHEA
			(covering now, but well)
		I don't exactly know. 
		Philip doesn't like to talk about
		the past.

				HARRY
		Why not?

	Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze
	is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the
	two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

				DOROTHEA
		He's a secretive man.

				HARRY
		And you don't ask questions?

				DOROTHEA
		We don't share our lives the way a
		lot of people do.

				HARRY
		Does that mean...?

				DOROTHEA
		We haven't slept in the same bed
		for years.

				HARRY
		But obviously you still care what
		happens to him.

				DOROTHEA
		We wouldn't be having this
		conversation if I didn't. Swann's
		one of the most remarkable men
		alive.

	Harry, frowns.

				DOROTHEA
		You don't believe me.

				HARRY
		He's an illusionist.  It's not
		exactly brain surgery. 

	Dorothea stares at him. 

				HARRY
		Sorry.  You asked.

				DOROTHEA
		No.  You're right.  He could have
		been something more. Maybe a lot
		more.  But people get lost.  Even
		good people. Too much fame.  Too
		much money,

				HARRY
		Where do I sign? 

	Dorothea LAUGHS lightly.

				DOROTHEA
		Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?

				HARRY
		Harry.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.

				HARRY
		I'm no bodyguard.

				DOROTHEA
		That's not what I'm asking for. I
		want somebody who can find out what
		Philip saw in those damn cards. 
		And stop it from happening.

				HARRY
		When do you want me to start?

				DOROTHEA
		Come to the show with me. Tonight I
		want you to see him with an
		audience.  They love him.

				HARRY
		Do you?

	The question catches Dorothea off guard.

				DOROTHEA
		I didn't marry him for love, Mr.
		D'Amour.  Tonight?

				HARRY
		Sure.

	Dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches
	her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her
	departing figure.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT

	CRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the
	theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk
	below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and
	PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS
	are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY
	MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they
	file in. 

	The atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. 
	He makes his way inside.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a
	conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie-
	talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely
	controlled hysteria. 

	Harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit
	CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea,
	already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

				DOROTHEA
		I'm glad you could make it. 

	Harry takes a seat beside her.

				HARRY
		Hey, this is a big deal for me. You
		know what seats like this cost in
		New York?

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Center-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for
	the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like
	flies.

				SWANN
		Valentin!

	Valentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is
	waiting there.

				SWANN
			(irritated)
		Valentin!

				VALENTIN
		I'm here.

				SWANN
		The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who
		I think it is? 

	Valentin nods.

	ON SWANN, his expression unreadable.

				SWANN
		He's young.

	MUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin
	hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused.

				1ST TECHNICIAN
			(to Swann)
		Ready?

				SWANN
		Ready.

	Swann rises up into the flies.

				1ST TECHNICIAN
		How the fuck does he do that?

				2ND TECHNICIAN
		It's wires, man.

				1ST TECHNICIAN
		I never seen no wires.

				2ND TECHNICIAN
			(sarcastic)
		So what is it?  Magic?

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

	The LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea,
	whose gaze is intent. 

	The LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly
	apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to
	blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
	into mystery.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Ladies and gentlemen.  You are
		standing on the threshold of a
		miracle...

	A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
	stage. 

	The vortex BLAZES -- 

	And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
	of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
	toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. 

	Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
	miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the
	dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the
	Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
	The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks
	open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
	dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the
	spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. 

	A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white
	tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his
	feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. 
	The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
	crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the
	sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.

				SWANN
		My friends ... come with me...into
		the Great Beyond.

	A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. 

	The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. 

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

				HARRY
		He's good.

				DOROTHEA
		You haven't seen anything yet.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT

	The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them. 

	Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted
	SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE.  Then he offers his ticket to
	the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT

	A new musical motif hangs in the air:  MUSIC announcing
	danger. 

	The AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously. 

	ON HARRY and DOROTHEA.

				DOROTHEA
			(a whisper)
		This is the new illusion.

	ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
	DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
	somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME. 
	It's a scene from Daniels Inferno.  Above him. a dozen
	glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending.  He
	struggles to free himself.  The MUSIC gets more exciting as
	the wheel spins faster and faster. 

	Suddenly, a sword DROPS.  It falls between Swann's
	outstretched legs, skewering the wheel.  Then ANOTHER, close
	to his head. 

	ON HARRY.  He's tense.  Excited. 

	BACK TO STAGE.  Swann is free I  He throws off the last
	shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
	wheel.  There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.

	The wheel slows.  He starts to step off it, as another of the
	the swords DROPS. 

	The AUDIENCE GASPS.  Swann smiles, and TRIPS. 

	As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
	carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
	him there.  Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort.  Some
	stop. 

	More GASPS from the audience. 

	ON HARRY, having a -- 

	FLASHBACK:  Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card. 
	The scene on the stage is that image coming to life. 

				HARRY 
		There's something wrong... 

	ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
	third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
	until TEN SWORDS have entered his body. 

	ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.

	The MUSIC has stopped.  In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
	nervously.  A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
	dies away in a matter of moments.

	ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY

				DOROTHEA
		No. . .

	ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
	wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death.  He
	reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead. 

	There are GASPS now from the audience.  Murmurs of disgust;
	sobs of horror.

				1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
		What happened?

				2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
		It's a trick.

				3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
		Somebody help him.

	The curtains start to close.

	ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.

				DOROTHEA
			(to Harry)
		I've got to get to him!

	The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
	seen sinks in.  There is panic.  A few people have fainted. 
	One or two are even praying. 

	Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
	against the flood of the exiting crowd.

				HARRY
		Out of the way!  Out of the way!

	He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
	she can duck beneath it.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Chaos.  PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
	watching.  Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
	MANAGER at his side.

				VALENTIN
			(to Stage Manager)
		Get then out of here, for God's
		sake --

				STAGE MANAGER
		You heard him!  It's not a fucking
		show!

	He starts to physically push the crowd back.  Harry grabs his
	arm.

				STAGE MANAGER
		Who are you?

	Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
	MANAGER out of Dorothea's way.  She goes to Swann's body,
	which has been removed from the wheel.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

	The audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming
	towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
	enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both?

				MILLER
		Psst!

	Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.

	Butterfield enters.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT

	Dorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry
	examines the mechanism of the wheel.

				DOROTHEA
			(softly)
		Swann... 

	A DOCTOR appears.

				DOCTOR 
		I'm a doctor.  Let me through. 

	The Doctor checks Swann's body.

				DOCTOR
			(to Dorothea)
		I'm sorry...

	Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. 
	He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the
	mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
	cable as he goes.

	WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT

	It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
	used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
	beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
	and echoing. 

	The cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been
	taken. 

	A NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy
	FIGURE ducking away.

				HARRY
		Hey!

	He gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and
	listens for movement. 

	Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
	wood and smashes it into Harry's face!

	Harry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
	nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.

				MILLER
		Got you, fucker!

	Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of
	the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed
		Swann? 

	Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

				HARRY
		You did.
			(a beat)
		Didn't you?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Why would I do that?

				HARRY
		Beats me.

	Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You don't have a clue what you're
		into, do you?

				HARRY
		Deep shit? 

	Butterfield hits him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
		I told you --

	Butterfield hits him again.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Who did this?

				HARRY
			(raises his hand)
		All right.  It was...

	Butterfield comes a little closer.

				HARRY
			(feigning a near collapse)
		... it was...

	Butterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls --
	literally -- rising as he does so.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
	in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
	Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. 

	He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold
	of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
	TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES
	OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
	MECHANISM. 

	Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
	dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. 

	-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is
	closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! 
	The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. 

	Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
	shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's
	BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.

				HARRY
		Deep shit...

				FADE OUT

				FADE IN

	INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised. 
	Eddison has just finished taking his statement.

				EDDISON
		And this Butterfield guy--

				HARRY
		--vanished.

				EDDISON
			(frustrated sigh)
		Another fucking magician. Jesus.

	Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea
	being taken into another office.

				HARRY
		Are you finished with me?

				EDDISON
		For now.  Are you planning to go
		back to New York?

				HARRY
			(watching Dorothea)
		No.  Not yet...

	INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT

	Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  Harry enters.

				HARRY
		Are they treating you okay?

				DOROTHEA
			(nods)
		I heard what happened.  It looks
		like somebody murdered him.

				HARRY
		I'm sorry I got into this too late. 
		But if you want me to stick around,
		maybe dig where the cops don't
		look...

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where you'd start.

				HARRY
		Well... how about some of the other
		illusionists?

				DOROTHEA
		They won't tell you anything.

				HARRY
		I can be very persuasive.

				DOROTHEA
			(a beat)
		Yes.  I think you probably can.
			(another beat)
		We'd need to talk about your fee.

				HARRY
		Forget the fee.  If I find
		Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
		money.  If I don't...
			(he shrugs)
		...my gamble.  Either way... I
		get to spend some time... here.

	The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
	means near -Dorothea.  And by the tiny smile on her face,
	it's also plain she knows it.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

	Noon.  Bright sun.  Busy street.  Harry, now wearing a
	bandage on his cut face, enters.

	INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY

	A wonderland for illusionists.  Books, props, masks, tricks,
	etc.  Two or three CUSTOMERS browse.  Harry glances at them
	all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
	through books, one-handed.  His other hand constantly
	manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
	ways.  He doesn't even look at his hand.  His name is WALTER
	WILDER. 

	Harry stands beside him.  Scans the shelf.

				HARRY
		Where'd you learn that?

				WILDER
		What?

				HARRY
			(points)
		That.

				WILDER
		At birth.  I don't know you --

				HARRY
		Harry D'Amour.

				WILDER
		I know all the kids coming up. Got
		to stay ahead of the game. But I
		don't know you.

				HARRY
		I'm in from New York.  I came to
		see Swann.

				WILDER
		What a tragedy.  It was just a
		matter of time, of course, but it's
		not good for the business.

				HARRY
		Was he taking a lot of risks?

				WILDER
		You don't know the half of it. I'm
		Walter Wilder, by the way.

				HARRY
		Not the Walter Wilder? 

	Walter beams.

				WILDER
		The one and only. 

	He hands Harry a card.

				WILDER
		Want to try?

	Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
	rest of this conversation.

				WILDER
		You know Vinovich?

				HARRY
			(not a clue)
		Sure.  Vivovich.

				WILDER
		He knew Swann way back.  He says
		there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
		crazy shit.

				HARRY
		I'd love to... you know... hang
		with some of you guys.

				WILDER
		People are pretty cagey.  Who do
		you know?

				HARRY
		For what?

				WILDER
		For an introduction.

				HARRY
		Well... nobody.

	Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
	manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

				WILDER
			(magnanimously)
		You do now.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK

	The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. 

	Harry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is
	knotting a newly-bought tie.

				HARRY
		I only wear ties for funerals.

				WILDER
		You don't get in without one. It's
		like a gentlemen's club for
		illusionists.  Except most of us
		aren't gentlemen.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

	The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with
	illusionists' posters. 

	Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
	where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
	audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to
	half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
	stairs and towards the bar.

HARRY
		Are they all in the business?

				WILDER
		It's not a business. Harry. It's a
		vocation. 

	Wilder points to a locked door.

				WILDER
		That's what they call the
		Repository.  Every magic secret
		known to man's locked up in that
		room.

				HARRY
		Have you been in?

				WILDER
		No.  There's only three keys.
		Vinovich has got one, of
		course.
			(beat)
		He's a little crazy, by the way. 
		And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
		he's a real charmer.

				CUT TO

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT

	Later.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his
	40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
	fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry
	and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
	LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
	two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
	overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
	waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. 

	In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
	repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

				VINOVICH
		It's more than entertainment. We're
		opening people's heads up.  Putting
		miracles back into their boring
		little lives.

				BILLY
		But they're fake miracles.

				VINOVICH
		Houdini believed he had spirit
		guides.

				HARRY
		You believe that?

				VINOVICH
		I think we walk a narrow path,
		between... between...

				HARRY
		Heaven and Hell?

	Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
	he's being sarcastic or not.

				VINOVICH
		Trickery and divinity.

				HARRY
		Are you saying that sometimes
		the miracles are real?

				VINOVICH
		No.  I'm saying they were always
		fake.  The saints, the messiahs,
		they were just illusionists.

				HARRY
		So could you walk on water?

				VINOVICH
			(deadly serious)
		I could reproduce any miracle
		that's ever been performed, with a
		little preparation.

				HARRY
		What about Swann's miracles?

	The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are
	exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny
	smile.

				VINOVICH
		They weren't worth a damn.

				HARRY
			(goading)
		I heard he was the best.

				VINOVICH
		If he was so good why's he so dead?

	Vinovich begins to look suspicious.

				HARRY
		You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd
		maybe have a theory.

				VINOVICH
		Oh, I've got plenty.

				HARRY
		I'd like to hear them. 

	Vinovich rises.

				VINOVICH
		I'm not saying another word.
			(to Wilder)
		You damn fool.  He's a
		journalist.

				HARRY
		Just tell me about Swann.  Or are
		you too scared?

				VINOVICH
		He was a freak.  Everything he did
		was tainted.

	Harry rises.  Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.

				HARRY
		With what?

				VINOVICH
		Evil.  He was evil.
			(to Laura)
		Come on.

	She rises.

				VINOVICH
			(to the rest)
		Say nothing to this man if you wish
		to keep my company.

	He stalks away.  Harry calls after him, across a now-
	silenced bar.

				HARRY
		Great accent, by the way.  Is it
		Brooklyn?

				VINOVICH
			(pure Brooklyn)
		Fuck you.

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Harry heads to the car.

				BILLY (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry turns.  Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
	that he's not being watched.

				BILLY
		I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich
		sees me talking to you.  He's an
		asshole, but he's a powerful
		asshole.

				HARRY
		They go together.

				BILLY
			(lowered voice)
		I've heard a name.  Someone they
		talk about in whispers.

				HARRY
		Who?

				BILLY
		Nix.

				HARRY
		Nix?

				BILLY
		Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.

				HARRY
		Who is he?

				BILLY
		I think maybe he taught Swann.
			(hands Harry a card)
		This is me.  See ya around. 

	Billy hurries away.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry lies on his bed, dozing.  The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		... I want somebody who can find
		out what Philip saw in those damn
		cards... 

	Harry frowns in his semi-doze.

				DISSOLVE TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				BUTTERFIELD
		Ever watched a man die?

	The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.

				QUAID
		Please... I wasn't there... Ask
		Pimm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's
		disappeared...

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is still asleep.

				CUT TO:

	FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM

				QUAID
		I'm not afraid to die.  There's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

	A long silence. 

	SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.

				BACK TO:

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	HARRY sits up, shocked awake.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He picks up the receiver.

				HARRY
		This is D'Amour.
 
           
			CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
	else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
	source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
	opposite the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry... I know it's late.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

	There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
	Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
	the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
	touch them.

				HARRY
		That's okay.

	As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
	page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.

				DOROTHEA
		How did it go today?

				HARRY
		I went up to the Magic Castle. You
		were right.  He didn't have a lot
		of fans up there.

				CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		They were jealous of him.

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Why?  Because he had you?

				BACK TO:

	INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN

				DOROTHEA
		He... didn't have me..  I told you-

				HARRY
		You didn't marry him for love.

	DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM

	She's a little uncomfortable now.

				HARRY
		So why did you marry him?

				DOROTHEA
		That's my business. Harry.

				HARRY
		Just curious.
			(a beat)
		Back to business.  Ever heard of a
		man called Nix?
			(silence)
		Dorothea?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't
		know the name.

				HARRY
		What about Jennifer Desiderio?

				DOROTHEA
		It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to
		go.

				HARRY
		Okay.  I'll keep digging.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		Yes.  You do that.

	She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. 
	She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks
	up the phone again.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
	Harry's doodles.  The phone RINGS. 

	CUT WIDE:  The room is empty.

	EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
	heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
	Quaid's Waiting Room. 
	It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come
	prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
	locks.

	INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT  

	Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and
	enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the
	TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
	Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
	blood-spattered table:

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		If you watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping.

	Harry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening
	cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
	are stashed everywhere.  Boxes of crystals, religious
	statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

	He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
	in a niche at the base of the drawer.  He pulls the drawer
	out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

	Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  It has a
	false bottom.

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Yes...

	In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
	He flicks to "D."

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		Desiderio...

	There it is.  Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets
	the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
	his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

	-- Valentin!

				HARRY (CONT'D)
		What the fuck are you doing here?

				VALENTIN
		Looking for you.  I tried the
		hotel.

				HARRY
		Why'd you come here?

				VALENTIN
		You're a detective, with no clues. 
		Where else are you going to look? 
		I'm going to keep this brief.
			(he takes out an envelope)
		Here's thirty thousand dollars.

				HARRY
		What for?

				VALENTIN
		A ticket home,

				HARRY
		You didn't hire me.  She did.
		If she wants me off the job, I
		want to hear it from her.

				VALENTIN
		She doesn't want to see you. She's
		had enough pain.  Enough churning
		over the past.  She wants it all
		left alone.

				HARRY
		Left alone?  Somebody's been
		murdered.

				VALENTIN
		Yes.  It's regrettable

				HARRY
		Fuck regrettable!  I want to know
		why.

				VALENTIN
		What for?  You need to stay busy?

				HARRY
			(a confession)
		I like to know why things happen.

				VALENTIN
		Why people die?
			(shakes his head)
		Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.

				VALENTIN
		Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
		Just leave her alone.  Let her
		heal.

	He glances back at Valentin.

				HARRY
		Lock up, will you?

				CUT TO:

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY

	ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.

	Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
	building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY

	The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
	decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
	Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
	black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's only ever had one
		visitor.

				HARRY
		A Mister Quaid?

				TOFFLER
		Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I
		saw it on the news. Jennifer
		doesn't know.  And frankly, this
		isn't the best tine for her to be
		told.

				HARRY
		I won't say anything.

	INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY

	Toffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are
	distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no
	screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
	Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.

				TOFFLER
		Jennifer's been with us four years. 
		She was coming on nicely. 
		But just the last month or so,
		she's worse than ever.

				HARRY
		What's her problem?

				TOFFLER
		She has no real grip on reality.

				HARRY
			(a joke)
		Does anybody?

				TOFFLER
			(deadly serious)
		Oh yes.  We have to agree what's
		real and what's not. That's what
		holds us together.

				HARRY
		And what does Jennifer think's
		real?

	They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
	outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.

				TOFFLER
			(quietly)
		Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
		for her.
			(louder)
		Jennifer?

	Jennifer turns.  She looks terrible.

	EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY

	Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
	Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
	the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
	steadily gets louder as they walk.

				JENNIFER
		Have we met before?

				HARRY
		No.

				JENNIFER
		Only I forget.  They give me pills,
		you know, to keep me... even...
		and... I forget things,

				HARRY
		Well, you didn't forget me.  I just
		came because I wanted to know if
		you knew a man called Butterfield.

				JENNIFER
		Maybe... I... don't...

				HARRY
		What about Philip Swann?

				JENNIFER
		I knew Swann.
			(sudden vehemence)
		He's a fucking liar.

	A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.

				HARRY
		Why's that?

				JENNIFER
		He said he knew how to protect us. 
		But he didn't know anything.  He
		made us think it was over and done
		with.

				HARRY
		What is?

				JENNIFER
			(tears nearing)
		I don't want to think about it. If
		I think about it he'll hear me. 
		He'll find me.

				HARRY
		Swann?

	Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
	laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
	we're aware of it.

				JENNIFER
		I told you.  I don't --

	She stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen
	and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: 

	The hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in
	shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
			(screaming)
		God no!  Oh God no!

	She backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her.

				NURSE
		Calm down!

	She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung
	back.

				JENNIFER
		He's not going to get me!

	She races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her.

				JENNIFER (CONT'D)
		He's not!  He's not!

				HARRY
		Who's not? 

	He catches up with her.

				JENNIFER
		Nix! Nix!

				HARRY
		Is he the Puritan?

				JENNIFER
		Yes! Yes!

				HARRY
		And he's dead?

				JENNIFER
		No.  He's coming back.  He's
		digging his way out!

	The Nurse appears behind Harry.

				NURSE
		I'll take care of her now.

	Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.

				NURSE
		Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!

	The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
	instantly, racing towards the street.

				HARRY
		Jennifer!

	She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
	top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
	metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the
	Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down.

	HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET

	Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
	wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling
	incoherently. 

				HARRY
		Jesus.

	He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

	He looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. 
	His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
	head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
	a grave.  Harry closes his eyes.

				HARRY
			(very quietly)
		Jesus.

	EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

	The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

	Harry's on the phone.



				HARRY
		I want to speak to Dorothea.

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		I'm afraid she's not in.

				HARRY
		When will she be in?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin on the phone in the study.

				DOROTHEA
		Who is it?

	Valentin puts the phone down.

				VALENTIN
		Crank call.  I'll get the number
		changed.

				DOROTHEA
		No word from D'Amour?			    

	Valentin shakes his head.

				VALENTIN
		It's better he's gone.  He would
		have done more harm than good.

				DOROTHEA
		Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think,
		so.  Try him again at the hotel.

				VALENTIN
		I left three messages already.

	Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns
	and leaves the room.

	INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.

				HARRY
			(on phone)
		Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I
		wanted to get into the repository
		at the Magic Castle?

				CUT TO:

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT        

	THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT:  ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS. 

	PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT.  HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF
	GLASS.  BILLY'S BEHIND HIM.  THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH
	LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.

				HARRY
		You've done this before.

				BILLY
		I've had my moments.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Harry's manipulating the lock.

				BILLY
		I'm sure they'll have this place
		rigged.

				HARRY
		How?

				BILLY
		It'll be something hokey. 

	CLICK! The door opens.

				BILLY
		Houdini'd been proud of you.

	INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT

	Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
	posters in every direction.

				BILLY
			(impressed)
		Whoa...

	On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools
	of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
	IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed
	while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
	investigate.

				BILLY
		I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.

				HARRY
		You heard right.

				BILLY
		You ever been married?

				HARRY
		Yeah.  She was killed in a car
		crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She
		was filing for divorce.

				BILLY
		Why?

				HARRY
		My life was too weird for her.

				BILLY
			(grinning)
		I love weird.

	Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.

				HARRY
		Billy?  This was on Miller's
		forehead.  Any idea what it is?

				BILLY
		Nope.

	Harry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.

				BILLY
		What did I tell you?  So fucking
		hokey.

	Inside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS.

				HARRY
		What have we got here?

	Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- 

	two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

	Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
	skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his
	sinews straining.

				HARRY
		Grab the files!

	Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
	steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
	CLANG!

				BILLY
		Jesus!

	He slams the files down.  He's trembling.

				BILLY
		I could have lost my fucking hands.

				HARRY
		That would have kept you out of the
		Magic Circle.
			(he studies the files)
		Which was presumably the idea.
			(a beat)
		These are about Nix.

	Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.

				HARRY
		You go through these.  Go on!

	Reluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded
	PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
	painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. 
	There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY
	-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
	that) - is NIX.

				HARRY
		Wait a minute...

	He stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different
	colours.

				HARRY
		That's Butterfield...

				BILLY
			(points to nan in)
		doorway)
		And who's that?

	ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

	ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.

				HARRY
		At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.

	Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows
	a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
	of another man's HEAD.

				BILLY
		Take a look at this.

				HARRY
			(looking at it)
		A Nix specialty?

	Billy is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series.  We
	glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at
	his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone
	beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see
	a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
	DARKNESS.

				BILLY
		I don't know any of these tricks...

	Harry studies the etchings.

				HARRY
			(a slow burn)
		Maybe they're not tricks.

				BILLY
			(mystified)
		I mean, there's no instructions--
			(realizes what Harry said)
		What do you mean, they're not
		tricks?

				HARRY
		What did Vinovich say? Something
		about walking a path between --

				BILLY
		Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he
		says that all the time.

				HARRY
		That's because he knew.  He'd seen
		these files and knew.

				BILLY
		Knew what?

	Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
	book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his
	lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. 
	Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

	Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A
	figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

	Harry takes out his gun. 

	Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
	goes after the apparition. 

	The TRACK is completely silent. 

	Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up,
	its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

	It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
	backs away.

				BILLY
		Harry!

	Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
	shelves.

				BILLY
		Where the fuck are you?

	Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.

				HARRY
		Okay.  Hold it right there.

	The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
	of smoke. 

	Harry waves his hands through it.  It's completely ethereal. 

	But it's still terrorizing Billy.

				BILLY
			(in mortal terror)
		Get it off me!

	Harry glances around.  Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
	books.  FIRES at it.  The light goes out.  The "Psycho"
	vanishes.  Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

				HARRY
		Hokey enough for you?

				BILLY
		I'm out of here, man!  Are you
		coming?

	Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.

				HARRY
		I'm coming.

	Billy is already out of the room.  For a moment. Harry pauses
	to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
	gates. 

	As he does so --

	-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
	"Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.

				HARRY
		Ah, shaddup!

	He FIRES at the projector a second time.

	On the GUN SHOT --

				CUT TO:

	EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT

	Billy and Harry are parting.

				HARRY
		Thanks, Billy.

				BILLY
		Hey, anytime.
			(a beat)
		Actually, no.  This was enough. 

	They shake, and part.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

	Harry waits on the doorstep.  Valentin opens the door.

				VALENTIN
			(quietly)
		I can't let you in.

			(stepping in)
		Yeah, I know.

				VALENTIN
		You want more money, is that it?

	Harry pushes him aside.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.

				HARRY

	He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts

		Shut up!

	He pushes open the door.

	The room is a museum of Swarm's career.  Posters, and
	memorabilia everywhere.  And in the middle of the room,
	Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
	Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

				DOROTHEA
		This is the way he wanted it... no
		autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
		meddling with his body...

	Harry approaches, slowly.

				DOROTHEA
		Flesh is a trap.  That's what he
		used to say.  Flesh is a trap and
		magic sets us free.
			(a beat)
		Why did you come back?

				HARRY
		I didn't leave.  I was just digging
		around.

	Dorothea looks up at him.

				DOROTHEA
			(uneasy)
		What did you find?

				HARRY
		Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
			(he watches her for a
		response)
		She threw herself in front of a car
		this afternoon.

	Dorothea can't disguise her distress.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh Christ.

				HARRY
			(a beat)
		Why don't you tell me the truth?

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

	Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
	PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.

				HARRY
		Nix ran some kind of cult, right? 
		Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?

				DOROTHEA
		It was more than that, I think.

				HARRY
		He was the real thing, right?

				DOROTHEA
		Swann said he could do stuff, yes.

				HARRY
		Stuff?

				DOROTHEA
		He could get into people's heads. 
		Make them see things. Terrible
		things.  And he could levitate. 
		Juggle fire.

				HARRY
		He taught all this to Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		Some or it.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT

	Valentin is listening at the door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-

				HARRY
		So Swann was performing magic. not
		illusions?
			(Dorothea nods)
		And what?  You thought he should be
		using it to cure cancer, not making
		millions.

				DOROTHEA
		I told you --

				HARRY
		Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess
		that'd turn anybody's head.
		Including yours.

				DOROTHEA
		No.

				HARRY
		You said you weren't with him for
		love.

				DOROTHEA
		I wasn't.

				HARRY
		 What then?

				DOROTHEA
		I was grateful to him.  I owed him
		my life.  And he loved me. He
		couldn't always show it, but he
		felt it.

				HARRY
		He thought Nix was coming back,
		didn't he?

	Dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips
	from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They
	stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost
	palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

				DOROTHEA
		Shit!

	They are very close to each other.

				HARRY
			(reassuring)
		It's okay.

				DOROTHEA
		No it isn't.  You can't help me.

				HARRY
			(tenderly)
		I'm here, aren't I?

	He kisses her.  She kisses him back, hard.

				HARRY
		Nothing's going to happen to you.  

				DOROTHEA
			(seductive)
		Nothing?

				HARRY
			(smiles)
		Nothing you don't want. 

	They kiss again, passionately.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
	the darkened lobby and head upstairs.  Then Valentin crosses
	to the phone and dials.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A room of illusions.  Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
	flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
	Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.

	It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.

	INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Valentin opens the front door.  There's a wind blowing. The
	palms churn against the night sky...

	INTERCUT

	Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
	of Harry and Dorothea.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.

				DOROTHEA
			(whispers)
		I was so afraid.

				HARRY
		Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you sure?

				HARRY
		I'm sure.
			(kisses her)
		He's dead.

				DOROTHEA
		I know.  I'm the one who shot
		him.

	ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.

				DOROTHEA
		I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage,
		to get Swann to come to him.

				HARRY
			(realizing)
		And they all came...

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Quaid and Jennifer--

				DOROTHEA
		And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was
		ready for them.

	There's a NOISE downstairs.

				DOROTHEA
			(nervous)
		What was that?

				HARRY
		It's okay. 

	Harry slips out of bed.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT

	Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
	is all he wears).  He has his gun.

				HARRY
		Valentin? 

	Dorothea appears behind him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?  Wait!

	Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in
	a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail
	of clothing or face.

				HARRY
		What the hell-?

	Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of
	ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his
	skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
	skull.

				HARRY
			(in pain)
		Aah!

	Harry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the
	Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone.

				DOROTHEA
		It's him!  It's Nix!

	Harry goes out into the passageway.

				HARRY
		Valentin!  Get some lights on!

	As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
	erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger
	"unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
	physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
	writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at
	it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
	leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
	door, and flings it open.  He's in -- 

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT     

	The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. 
	Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the
	doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then,
	he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the
	Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
	the CASKET.

				HARRY
		Somebody you know?

	Dorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and
	sweating, cornered against the casket.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God!

	The Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN,
	supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the
	gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.

				HARRY
		Which goes first?  My face or
		your heart?

	The Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers
	and dies.

				DOROTHEA
		Who in God's name are you?

	She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
	into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his
	exit.

				DOROTHEA
		Are you all right?

				HARRY
		Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him
		in here!

	Dorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders
	and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts
	to force off the lid. 

	Valentin and Dorothea enter.

				VALENTIN
		What are you doing?  This is
		sacrilege.

	He starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls. 

	Inside, Swann's corpse.

				VALENTIN
		Are you satisfied now?

				HARRY
		No.

	Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
	into the corpse's mouth.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		It's all right.  It's not
		hurting...

	He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw.  It cracks -- 

	-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

				HARRY
		...plaster doesn't bleed.

	He tosses the jaw to Valentin.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		It looks like you're not a widow
		after all.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

	Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
	binds Harry's hand.

				HARRY
		You rigged the illusion to fail,
		right?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		You paid off the doctor.  You set
		up the fake body.  Yes?

				VALENTIN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		And then... because I was
		getting too close to something --
			(at Dorothea)
		--or someone, you called Swann

				VALENTIN
		I tried to pay you off.

				HARRY
		Was that Swann's idea?

				VALENTIN
		No.  It was mine.  I didn't want
		any more bloodshed. That's why we
		went to all this trouble, so
		there'd be no one for Nix to come
		after.

				HARRY
		Nix is dead and buried, for
		fuck's sake.

				VALENTIN
		Haven't you seen enough to know
		that doesn't matter?

	ON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
	Nix's resurrection is plausible.

				HARRY
		I want to see Swann face to face.

				VALENTIN
		Why don't you leave this alone? Let
		everybody think it's over?

				DOROTHEA
		What about me?

				VALENTIN
		Nix was never interested in you. 
		It was always Swann. 

	A beat.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Maybe Valentin's right.  We should
		let it alone. 

	A BELL starts to TOLL-

				HARRY
			(con't.)
		He went to all that trouble to be
		dead.  Maybe we should let him stay
		that way.

	The TOLLING carries over into

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
	MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the
	Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there
	amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: 
	Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
	Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of
	the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
	to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

	Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
	from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as
	she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
	condolesence.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
	are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
	in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially
	dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. 

	Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
	"died."  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.

	EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY

	THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
	down into the street.

				1ST WORKER
		Watch out!

	On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. 
	We don't see who.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY

	Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
	cemetery.  Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit. 

	Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.

	EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY

	The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car. 

	On Harry, as he gets into his.

	INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY

	Valentin hears something in the auditorium.  Looks up.

				VALENTIN
		Who's there?

	He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE. 
	He swings round.  Too late.

	Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  He kicks Valentin
	to the ground.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(conversationally)
		I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
		another profession, I would have
		been a surgeon.

	On Valentin, staring up in terror. 

	Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
	the scalpel glittering.

				BUTTERFIELD
		To be able to heal with one little
		cut.

	On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
	just beneath his eye.

				VALEMTIN
		No. . .

				BUTTERFIELD
		Let's say those eyes of yours were
		giving you trouble.

				VALENTIN
		Please.

				BUTTERFIELD
		I could scoop them out.

				VALENTIN
		Don't.

				BUTTERFIELD
		So tell me where Nix is buried.

				VALENTIN
		I don't know.

	Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin. 

	CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
	Butterfield's body.

				VALENTIN
		Wait!

	On Valentin again.  There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
	that's all.

				VALENTIN
		I'll tell you.

				BUTTERFIELD
		You'll do more.than that.

	EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY

	A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
	Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
	barbed wire.  He peers through the bars. 

	Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
	into the building.  He glances back towards the street.  We
	get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

	Harry slides out of sight.  Waits until the Stranger has gone
	inside.  Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
	wire.

	INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY		   

	It's been a hospital.  Now the echoing corridors and wards
	are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering. 
	Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies. 

	Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
	the Stranger. 

	He enters a shadowy room.  Birds fly UP into his face! 

	As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him. 
	GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into

	INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

	Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
	fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
	equipment.  Eerie.  Disturbing. 

	Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

				HARRY
		I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
		away.

	Silence.  Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
	operating table.

				HARRY
		You had to see who wept for you the
		most.

	Silence.

				HARRY
		A lot of people are going to be
		really pissed off when they
		discover you're still alive.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		They'll never find out. 

	Harry looks up.

	Svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his
	temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of
	concentration.

				HARRY
		Look, Ma, no wires.

				SWANN
		You shouldn't have followed me,
		D'Amour.

				HARRY
		How the fuck do you do that?

				SWANN
		Now I'm going to have to kill you.

				HARRY
		I don't think so.  You need me
		alive.

				SWANN
		Why?  So you can fuck my wife?

	Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.

				HARRY
		Be careful.  Funerals make me
		trigger-happy.

	Swann stops, inches from the ground.

				HARRY
		You know, it's such a fucking
		waste.  You can do shit most of us
		can only dream about, and you go
		around pretending it's some trick.

				SWANN
		Illusionists get. Las Vegas
		contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get
		burned.

				HARRY
		Or murdered, like Nix.

				SWANN
		He deserved it.

				HARRY
		Maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
		Maybe he's digging his
		way out of the hole you put him
		right now.  That's what you're
		hiding away from, isn't it?

				SWANN
		I did it for Dorothea.

				HARRY
		Oh yeah?

				SWANN
		Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
		off her.

	Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
	they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his
	posturing, is afraid.

				HARRY
		So Nix won't come looking for her?

				SWANN
		It's me betrayed him.

				HARRY
		And she shot him I  I think that'd
		piss me off if I were Nix.

				SWANN
			(despairing)
		I don't know what else to do.

				HARRY
		Help me.

	On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

				HARRY
		Listen.  If he's back from the
		dead, then he is some kind of god. 
		And he'll find you, wherever the
		fuck you are. 
		And if he's just another phony
		Messiah, then you can stage the
		greatest come-back in history.

	ON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
	are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. 
	SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

	We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
	several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely
	suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

	We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
	A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We
	see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
	floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

	Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
	Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman
	grins.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into
	the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
	the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.

	INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
	brandy.

				SWANN
		Is this the best brandy you've
		got?

				CASHIER
		If that's what's on the shelves.

	Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.

				SWANN
		Can you change a thousand for me?

				CASHIER
			(amazed)
		You're shittin' me.

				HARRY
		Can we go?

	Swann starts to COUGH.  A QUARTER falls from his mouth.

				HARRY
		Oh Jeez.

				SWANN
		Will that do?  No?

	Swann coughs again.  Puts his hand to his mouth.  A DELUGE of
	QUARTERS runs between his fingers.

				SWANN
		That better? 

	The Cashier gapes.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK

	The house could not look more reassuringly calm.  A SWAN
	struts beside the pool.  A long, HUSHED MOMENT...

				SHOCK CUT TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame. 

	CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
	crazed. 

	Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
	shadowy figure.  Is it Nix?  We can't quite see.  Black BLOOD
	runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.

	NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
	falling gouts of dark fluid --

	-- she struggles, SOBBING --
			 CUT TO:

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She tosses around on the bed

				BACK TO:

	DOROTHEA'S DREAM

	-- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand.  The Cultists shake it
	from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
	SPLASHES on her upturned face --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream.  She gets
	up and goes out onto --

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK

	Looks down the stairs.

				DOROTHEA
		Who's there?

	Silence.  Then, Valentin speaks behind her.  She jumps.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry.

	BLOOD runs from his cut face.

				DOROTHEA
		Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do
		to your face?

				BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
		It was me.

	She turns.  He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
	against the wail.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Guess who we're going to see?

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK

	Harry drives.  Swann takes a throatful of brandy.  Then he
	stares at Harry.

				SWANN
		You think I'm an asshole.

				HARRY
		Didn't know you read minds.

				SWANN
			(a warning)
		I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. 
		But you know that.
			(an apology)
		So I like playing games with
		people.  Gives them something to
		wonder about...

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		I distract them from their banality
		for a few minutes. It's like a
		public service.  It doesn't mean
		much in the end. They're all going
		to die.

				HARRY
		And you're not? 

	Silence for a moment.

				SWANN
		Oh, I was going to discover the
		secret of the universe.  That's why
		I liked Nix.  He promised me all
		these explanations.

				HARRY
		And he didn't have them?

				SWANN
		He had something.  He showed me how
		to bend the rules.  A little
		levitation.  A few fireworks.

				HARRY
		Is that all?

				SWANN
		No.
			(a beat)
		At the end... when we had him
		cornered, he got into my head. He
		showed me what we really look like,
		when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. 
		Shit...

				HARRY
		And you believed him?

				SWANN
		I saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
		See, that's his best trick.  No
		illusions.  Just the truth.
			(he looks at Harry)
		Are you ready for that? 

	Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.

				SWANN
		Hey!

	Harry drinks.

				SWANN
		Thought not.

	EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT

	PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
	door.

	INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

	Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.

				HARRY
		Dorothea?

	Now he's on the landing.  Swann's below.

				SWANN
		She's not here.

	Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.

				HARRY
		Did she know where Nix was buried?

				SWANN
		No.

				HARRY
		Who else did?  Did Valentin?

				SWANN
		Yes.

				HARRY
		Jesus!

	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT	 

	Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
	stars.

	INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT       

	Valentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. 
	Dorothea is handcuffed. 

	He has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a
	series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on,
	confounded.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Like the look of these?  I made
		them myself, to set him free.

				DOROTHEA
		Why did you wait so long?

				BUTTERFIELD
		I didn't have the skill to
		resurrect him.  I had to teach
		myself.  And that took time.

				DOROTHEA
		And you think he'll be in a fit
		state to resurrect, after thirteen
		years?

				BUTTERFIELD
		If he was just a man like me, then
		no.  But he's not.

				DOROTHEA
		What is he?

				BUTTERFIELD
		Maybe he'll show you.

	ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
	Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.

	There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.

	It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. 
	We DRIFT towards the front door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.

	Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all
	CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
	blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack
	indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
	eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
	ears and scalps.

	And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...

				NORMAN
		He will come!  He will come! He
		will come!

	EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Wide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. 

	The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
	illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. 

	ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
	watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Anything?

				VALENTIN (V.0.)
		Not yet.

	Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
	reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.

				BUTTERFIELD
		If you've lied to me to me --

				VALENTIN
		I swear... this is the place Swann
		told me about.  The rocks...

	On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
	steps back towards the open car door. 

	Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
	Valentin.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Five more minutes.  Hear me? And
		you'd better not --

	A SOUND behind him.  Butterfield wheels round.  On the ground
	beside the open car door, the instruments.

				BUTTERFIELD
		What the fuck are you playing at?

	He goes to pick them up.  Dorothea steps from behind the
	door, with the sharpest in her hand.  She slashes at him. 
	Opens a WOUND across his arm.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Aah!

	He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
	hand, and slamming her against the car.  He hits her.  Once.
	Twice.  Then --

				VALENTIN (V.O.)
		Butterfield!

	Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
	flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.

				VALENTIN
			(blinded)
		In the corner...

	The beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

	A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.

				BUTTERFIELD
			(to Valentin)
		Keep away from it.

	Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
	The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath. 
	He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...

	Closer... 

	Closer... 

	He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
	ROAR!

	He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
	mask rolls into view.

				VALENTIN
		Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(reverentially)
		It's him... it's him.

	On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.

				CUT TO:

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	The car is static; the engine still running.

				HARRY
		They got here before us.

				SWANN
		Looks that way.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT

	Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.

	HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE

	Harry reaches the grave's-edge.  It's totally dark.  He peers
	in.  On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight. 
	Harry slides into the grave.

				HARRY
		Shit!

	He's in darkness now.  He gets to his feet, and starts to try
	and scramble out.

				HARRY
		Swann?  Swann!

	Silence.

	Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder!  Harry swings
	round.  It's Valentin.  He has been badly cut up. 

				VALENTIN
		D'Amour --

				HARRY
		Shit...

				VALENTIN
		Help me.

	He collapses into Harry's arms.

				HARRY
		Swann!

	INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

	Indecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not
	to help?

				HARRY (V.O.)
		Swann!

	He decides.  Gets out.

	EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT

	Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

				HARRY
		Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.

	Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
	lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

				VALENTIM
		He's got Dorothea. 

				SWANN
		And Nix?

				VALENTIN
		Him too.

				HARRY
		We've got to get you to a hospital.

				VALENTIN
		Don't bother.

				HARRY
		Shut up.  We've lost enough lives
		already.

				VALENTIN
		I'm sorry, D'Amour...

				HARRY
		What about?

				VALENTIN
		... Looks like you're going...
		to lose... one more.

	Valentin dies.

				HARRY
			(despairing)
		... no...

				SWANN
		He's better off this way.

				HARRY
			(furious)
		Nobody's better off this wav!

				SWANN
		You don't get it, do you? We're
		shit. D'Amour.

	He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into
	Nix's grave.

				SWANN
		That's where we're all going.

				HARRY
		In my time, and nobody else's.

	ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
	getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS
	retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS.

	EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	The house is silent now.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	We TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
	them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.

	ON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing
	WHITE now.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Do you wish him to be amongst us?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Will you come to him on your
		knees?

				CULTISTS
		Yes...

				BUTTERFIELD
		Be ready.

	Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. 
	With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
	bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
	MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
	sharp pieces of GLASS. 

	ON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
	BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. 
	Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its
	head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. 

	ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
	she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
	into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision.

				DOROTHEA
		Listen.  You've got everything you
		want.  You don't need me. .. 

	A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle
	POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
	We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
	occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
	signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

				BUTTERFIELD
		No, but he will.  After what you
		did to him.

	He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS
		that.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT

	The bottle-breaking has ceased.  The Cultists stand,
	breathless with anticipation.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	On Nix's emaciated mouth.  The lips TWITCH. 

	On Dorothea.  The DUST moves around her. 

	And Nix DRAWS BREATH. 

	On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The whisper runs through the congregation:

				CULTISTS
		He's coming home... he/s coming
		home...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	ON Dorothea, eyes wide.

				DOROTHEA
		Christ in Heaven.

	ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
	His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
	THROB. 

	Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
	move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
	still screwed over his eyes.

				BUTTERFIELD
		He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				CULTISTS
		He's with us... He's with us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
	gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
	TRACK. 

	Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
	coiled around his face and fingers!

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

	Butterfield looks up. 

				BUTTERFIELD
		Hold her!

	On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  It
	comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND.  At last, we see
	his eyes.

	NIX'S P.O.V.

	The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.

				NIX
			(fury to agony)
		Aaarrrgh!

	He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
	all the lights but two.  Then he strikes Butterfield to the
	ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
	him unconscious.  It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
	display of instant physical superiority.  Throughout, he
	literally ROARS in rage.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
	repressed frustration.  Many of them are dancing on the
	shards of glass now, crazed.

				CUT TO:

	EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
	getting out.  Swann stays put. 

	The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.

				HARRY
			(spooked)
		Jesus... what the hell's going on
		in there?

				SWANN
		At a guess... they just resurrected
		him.

				HARRY
		Fuck.

	Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
	of the car and follows.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot.  Butterfield is out
	for the count. 

	On Nix, as he stops screaming.  His face is grotesquely
	disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. 

	The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.

				NIX
		Children...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

				NIX
		Will you suffer to come unto me?

	One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see
	flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the
	agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob.

	Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

				NIX
		I've come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave.  Will you hear it?

				CULTISTS
		Yes... yes...

				NIX
		Follow me then.

	He steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of
	adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea.

				NIX
		Do I know you, child?

	He reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
	keeps her self-possession; but only just.

				NIX
		Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun
		this time, child?
			(a beat)
		Where's Swann?

				DOROTHEA
		I don't know where he is.

	Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


				NIX
		He'll come.  We've got unfinished
		business, he and I.

	Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
	Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
	wounds he's receiving. 

	The Cultists follow.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Nix strides into the middle of the room.

				NIX
			(whispered to Dorothea)
		Something terrible's going to
		happen.  But if you hold on to me,
		very tight, you may live a little
		longer.

	The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.

				NIX
			(to Cultists)
		Are you ready for my wisdom?

				CULTISTS
		Tell us... tell us...

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. 
	He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

	ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
	terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of
	the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.

				SWANN
			(in terrified awe)
		This is where we killed him.

				HARRY
			(looking at table)
		You didn't try hard enough.

				SWANN
		I can't... I can't go any
		further...

	Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
	grip.  He crosses to the door. 

	Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
	catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

	He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at
	Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

				NIX
		Here is my wisdom.

	He stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all
	directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
	power.

				BARBARA
		Show us. Puritan.

				NORMAN
		Yes, show us!

				ALL
		Show us!  Show us!

	With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
	Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark;
	perhaps bottomless. 

	Dorothea SCREAMS!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT

	Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
	passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
	ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches
	hold of his arm.

				SWANN
			(to Harry)
		Whatever he's doing to her, stop
		him!

	And Harry's up and away --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	-- he dashes over the glass --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him.  He REVOLVES as he
	floats over the chasm below then.

				NIX
			(to unseen Cultists)
		You see, I escaped the grave. So I
		have to give something to the grave
		in return.

	On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes. 

	A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS.  As Nix
	REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
	Cultists.

	At first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.

				NORMAN
		What's happening?

				NIX
		I have to give something back. So
		I'm giving you.

	They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. 
	They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.

				BARBARA
			(sobbing)
		Why?  Why?

				NIX
		You're not worthy.  None of you. 
		Only Swann was worthy. You just
		waited like lambs.

	Harry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to Harry.

				NIX
		Well I'm not your shepherd.

	Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground
	is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
	ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
	and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's
	gaze.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT

	Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
	They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
	resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
	is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time. 

	The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.

				SWANN
		Aah!

				BUTTERFIELD
		Go on, bleed.
			(he slashes at Swann
		again)
		Go on!  Go on!

	Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
	wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
	the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!

				BUTTERFIELD
			(screaming)
		No!

	He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to
	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
	running from his wound.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the still-sticky ground.  He's a yard from the edge of the
	pit now. 

	Nix swings round.

				NIX
		You're not Swann.  Who are you?
			(a beat) )
		Oh... I know what you want. He lets
		Dorothea slip from his arms.  

	Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
	Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN
	goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
	leading to the passageway.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh God!

				HARRY
		Hang on!

	Nix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make
	contact

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Nix!

	Nix looks up.

				NIX
		There you are. 

	Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.

				NIX
		I've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  Where I went wrong...

	With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
	chasm.

				SWANN
		And?

				NIX
		I should have been honest with you,
		right from the start.  I wasn't
		born to show people the error of
		their ways.  I was born to murder
		the world.

	ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door.  Harry glances
	back into the room.

				NIX
		You could still help me do that.

				SWANN
		Why would I want to?

				NIX
		Because you've got nothing else to
		live for.

				SWANN
		Not true.

				NIX
		The woman has a new love in her
		life.  Your friends are dead.
		Nobody's left to save you, but me

	He lays his hands on Swann.  Draws him into an embrace.

	ON HARRY and Dorothea.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		I've got to help him.

				DOROTHEA
		You can't.

				HARRY
		Nix has got to have a weak spot. 
		Everybody's got a fucking weak
		spot.

	A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --

	Butterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.

				BUTTERFIELD
		Bastard!

	He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
	BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
	Passageway. 

	Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.

				NIX
		Will you help me? 

	A beat.  Then Swann nods.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Nix lets him go.

				NIX
		You know I'll kill you when we're
		done.  I have to.

				SWANN
		Yes.

				NIX
		But until then... it's you and
		me... the way it always was.

				SWANN
		Yes.

	Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns.

				NIX
		Wait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?

				SWANN
		No!

				NIX
		Liar!

	Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

				NIX
		Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?

	With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. 
	They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs,
	one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards
	Dorothea.

				NIX
		She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
		I'll show you!

	He moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground,
	broken.

				SWANN
		Harry!

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.

				SWANN (V.O.)
		Harry!  Stop him!

	Harry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	Butterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see
	the impact.  HEARING it's enough. 

	Harry looks down at the body.  Then --

				NIX (V.O.)
		Where is she? 

	Harry turns.

	Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
	body as he comes at Harry!

				NIX
		Where did she go?

	Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
	fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
	struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.

	Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
	temples.  As before, there's no blood.

				NIX
		You've got Swann's disease. You
		think a little courage, a little
		love, and it'll all be all right. 
		Wrong!

	His fingers slide all the way in!

				HARRY
		Oh God!

	Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
	are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him.

				NIX
		Tell me where she is... and I'll
		make it go away...

	Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face
	SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! 

	ON HARRY, verging on insanity.

				HARRY
		Oh God... oh God...

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
	some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY.  We can't see her
	face.  Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer.

	ON HARRY

	as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
	Reaching out for the image.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The Woman reaches for Harry.

				WOMAN           
		Help me.

	ON HARRY

	as he touches the wall.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!

	He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
	painted.

				HARRY
		Dorothea!  Dorothea!

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Darkness swallows the image of the woman.  She is still
	screaming when she disappears.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	ON HARRY 

	literally beating his head against the wall!

				HARRY
		No!  No!  No!

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry...

	Harry stops.  Dare he believe this is truly her voice?

				DOROTHEA
		It's not real, Harry-

	Harry turns around.  Dorothea is there.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.

	ON HARRY, relief flooding his face.  Then --

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	-- the image MORPHS.  Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck. 

	ON HARRY, appalled.  Dorothea grabs hold of him.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's
		good between us, believe it.

	Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT.  He's
	fighting the delirium.  Or doing his best.


				HARRY
		... oh... God...

				DOROTHEA
		I'm here, Harry.

				HARRY
		...yes?

				DOROTHEA
		Yes.

	Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.

				NIX
			(to Dorothea)
		There you are, child. 

	Harry starts to look round.

				DOROTHEA
		Don't look.

				HARRY
		I... have... to.

				NIX
		Come on, child.  I want Swann to
		see you die. 

	Harry turns and looks at Nix.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle
	of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.

				NIX
			(to Harry)
		What are you looking at?

	ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
	and now slips inside. 

	ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.

	ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her
	hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her.

				HARRY
			(points to his brow)
		There... there!

	ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. 

	ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. 

	The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees,
	BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
	used to be.

	ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the
	wall, shaking.

				DOROTHEA
		Harry?

				HARRY
		I'm okay.  I'm okay.

	Harry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her.

	HARRY'S P.O.V.

	The last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she
	actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
	embrace. 

	Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him --

	-- it isn't over. 

	One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
	kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
	up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
	forehead --

				NIX
		One... last... illusion...

	-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound.

				DOROTHEA
		Oh my God.

	Harry and Dorothea start to get up... 

	Nix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
	stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
	utterly inhuman SHRIEK!

				SWANN (V.O.)
		... D'Amour...

	Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
	Swann is on the threshold. 

	Nix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

	He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
	the Meditation Room.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
	backed towards it by Nix. 

	When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is
	DEMONIACAL.

				NIX
		I am the purest of the pure.  I am
		the darkest of the dark...

	Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.

				SWANN
		Harry.  You can't kill him. 

	Harry crouches beside Swann.

				HARRY
			(whispers)
		He did something with the ground.

				SWANN
		Yes?

				HARRY
		Can you do it?

				SWANN
		I don't know.

				HARRY
		Try.

	ON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now.

				NIX (V.O.)
		I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond
		Hell.

	Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
	Nix topples.

	ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. 

	A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
	broken fingers -- 

	-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
	corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
	resurfacing --

	Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit.

				HARRY
			(to Dorothea)
		Get out of here!

	The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
	around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  So's
	Harry, of course. 

	Nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  The corpses weigh
	him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.

				NIX
		No!  No!  No!

	He's at the edge of the pit.

				DOROTHEA (V.O.)
		Harry!

	Harry looks round.  Dorothea's behind him, risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

	Nix starts to fall into the pit.  At the last minute, he
	reaches for Harry, as -- 

	-- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. 

	Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. 
	They look back to see 

	NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. 

	At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head.  He's dead. She
	closes his eyes.

				CUT TO:

	INT. THE PIT

	What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
	death by any villain in the history of cinema... 

	Nix is falling through rock.  Still SCREAMING.  He CRASHES
	against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
	smithereens.  And as he falls --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Is it finished?

				HARRY
		I think so.

	No it's not.  Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
	layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
	earth. 

	And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below.  He's
	approaching MAGMA.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				DOROTHEA
		Come on...

	She puts her arms around him.  Kisses him, sobbing with
	relief.

	INT. THE PIT

	Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
	disappears.  A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
	spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The room TREMBLES.  There's a ROAR in the earth.

	INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

				HARRY
		What the fuck? 

				DOROTHEA
		Harry-?

				HARRY
		Out!  Out! 

	They race for the front door --

	a breath-taking rate

	Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car.  They look back at the

AS CREDITS ROLL

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We're 
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
desert landscape.  This gliding, eerie POV continues as 
credits roll. when the credits end, the headlights seem to 
dim and soon we're moving through BLACKNESS.

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

in the blackness, a man, FRED, is sitting on a bed smoking a 
cigarette. we see his back, but with each glow of the 
cigarette ash, we see his face reflected in a mirror on the 
wall across from him.  In the darkness, there starts the 
sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large 
picture window just off screen.  As the curtain moves, hard-edged 
light begins crawling across the room, and we see 
everything clearly.  Fred is wearing a robe and pajamas, it's 
early morning.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE IN THE MIRROR - Blank expression - 
face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the 
cigarette.

CLOSE UP 0N FRED'S ACTUAL FACE - Unshaven, haggard look, eyes 
seem empty, glazed over.  Fred is 32 years old, with dark
hair.

THE DOORBELL RINGS.  Fred looks up, startled by the noise.  
He looks at the digital clock: 5:30 a.m.

FRED STANDS, goes to an INTERCOM on the wall next to the 
mirror.  He pushes a button.

A VOICE comes over the intercom.

				VOICE OVER
				INTERCOM
		Dick Laurent is dead.

Fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house.  He is on 
the upstairs level.  He looks through a narrow slot window, 
but can't see the front door below.  He goes further in the 
house to a picture window that overlooks the street below.  
There is NOBODY there.

INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Fred is dressed to go out: Black sport coat and slacks, 
buttoned up white shirt.  He picks up a music case.  A woman 
comes into the room.  This is Fred's wife, RENEE, 30 years 
old, dark hair, dressed smartly, a drink in her hand.

				RENEE
		You don't mind that I'm not coming
		tonight?

				FRED
		What are you going to do?

				RENEE
		I thought I'd stay home and read.

Fred looks her over, she's sexy without trying.

				FRED
		Read?... Read what, Renee?

Renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink.  Fred comes 
over to her, kisses her on the neck, which makes her laugh.

				FRED
		It's nice to know I can still make you
		laugh.

				RENEE
		I like to laugh, Fred.

				FRED
		That's why I married you.

				RENEE
		Wake me up when you get home.

Fred brushes her cheek with his fingers, allowing them to 
linger for a moment on her face.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

A blue neon sign reads: LUNA LOUNGE.

								CUT TO:

INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT

Fred is on the bandstand.  He takes a solo on his saxophone.  
Fred plays hot, hard, neo-bop.  The BAND wails madly behind 
him.  The PATRONS explode onto the dance floor, making it a 
wild scene.  Fred Is a lion now, roaring away on his tenor, 
driving everyone nuts.

After the band quits to take a break, FEMALE FANS come onto 
Fred, but he moves away, refusing their attentions.

Renee sleeping soundly.

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DOORSTEPS - DAY

Renee in a bathrobe, opens the front door to collect the 
mail.  She sees a plain, clean, manila envelope lying on the 
step.  She picks it up.

CLOSE UP ON THE ENVELOPE - No stamp, no writing, blank.  She 
takes the mail from the box, and goes back into the house.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Renee opens the manila envelope. She's noticeably nervous 
when she sees a videotape inside.  She stares at it.

Fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe.  He sees Renee staring 
at the videotape - before she hears him enter.  When she does 
hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape.

				FRED
		What's that?

				RENEE
		A videotape.

				FRED
		Who's it from?

				RENEE
		I don't know... There's no return address 
		on the envelope... In fact, there's no 
		address on it.

				FRED
		Does it say anything on the tape?

				RENEE
			(looking it over)
		No, nothing.

Fred walks over and picks up the tape.

				FRED
		Well, let's see what's on it.

Fred takes the tape to the VCR.  He inserts it into the
machine, and turns it on.  Fred goes toward the couch.

				FRED (CON'T)
			(to Renee)
		Come on.

They sit on the couch in front of the television.

The TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills 
the entire frame.  The videotape shows the front of THE 
MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it.  The 
picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND.  After the 
camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow.

Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments.  Renee 
looks relieved.

				RENEE
		It must be from a real estate agent.

				FRED
		Maybe.

We see a WIDE SHOT encompassing Fred, Renee, and the snowy 
image on the TV.

								FADE OUT:

								 FADE IN:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Renee is seated at the dining room table - coffee cup and 
grapefruit in front of her.  She is wearing glasses, reading 
a book.  Fred enters, and sees Renee, who does not look up or 
acknowledge him.  Fred goes into the kitchen, which is just 
off the dining room.  He comes back into the dining room with 
a cup of coffee, and sits down with it opposite Renee.  He 
lights up a cigarette, sips his coffee, and looks at her.

				FRED
		Good book, huh?

				RENEE
			(she looks up)
		Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.

				FRED
		Same one you were reading the other
		night?

				RENEE
		What night?

				FRED
		When you didn't come to the club.

				RENEE
		Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different
		one.

				FRED
		I called, you know.

				RENEE
		Called?  When?

				FRED
		From the club.  You didn't answer.

				RENEE
		I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep
		when you got home, wasn't I?

				FRED
		You were asleep when I got home, yes.

Renee goes back to her book.  Fred sips his coffee and 
smokes.

				RENEE
			(without looking up)
		I told you you could wake me up if you
		wanted to.

Renee looks up at him now, takes off her glasses, and stares 
at him.

CLOSE UP OF FRED'S FACE - a disturbed expression.

Renee seems about to say something more, but stops, puts her 
glasses back on and resumes reading.

								FADE OUT:

								 FADE IN:


INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Fred is in bed waiting for Renee.  He hears noises from the 
bathroom - bottles clinking, drawers opening and closing.  
Renee comes out wearing a robe, which she sheds just before 
getting into bed.  Naked under the covers, she switches out 
her bedside lamp.  The only light in the room comes from the 
outside, through the windows.  Fred moves closer to Renee, 
puts his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast.  She does 
not respond.  Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her 
passionately.  Renee accedes to his demands, but does not 
participate willingly.  He makes love to her voraciously, but 
her lack of passion disturbs him.  Fred can't stop, however, 
and when he comes she acts consolingly, stroking him 
maternally while he calms down.  He climbs off of her and 
retreats to his side of the bed.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S EYES - which express his horror and 
humiliation.

They lie there in the dark silence for a while.

Fred turns back toward Renee in the darkness.

				FRED
		I had a dream about you last night...

				RENEE
		Yeah?

				FRED
		You were in the house... calling my
		name... but I couldn't find you.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT

FRED'S DREAM

Fred is walking slowly across the living room.

Fred's POV: moving - searching.

Fred stops and listens.

				RENEE
			(tentatively - distant and off
			screen)
		Fred?  Fred, where are you?

The camera turns slowly back toward the hallway, and as it 
drifts it RISES UP following along the hall and turning 
slowly into the bedroom.  Renee is lying below in the bed.


				FRED V.0.
		Then there you were... lying in bed... 
		but it wasn't you... It looked like 
		you... but it wasn't.

The camera suddenly dives violently at Renee - into a TIGHT 
CLOSE UP.  Her face registers TOTAL FEAR.

								CUT TO:

INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Fred is lying in bed with Renee, who is now backlit by her 
bedside lamp.  Fred looks at her shadowed face, but it's not 
Renee's face.  It's a face Fred has never seen before.  Fred 
quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp, and looks 
quickly back at Renee, whose face is now her own.

				RENEE
		Fred, are you all right?

Fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face.  Renee 
covers his hand with her own, and closes her eyes.

								FADE OUT:

								 FADE IN:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY

Renee finds another envelope on the doorstep.  She opens it, 
pulls out a videotape.  A large dog is BARKING incessantly 
somewhere in the neighborhood.  Renee looks around to see if 
she can see the dog.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the 
mail.  She is a bit puzzled and unsettled.  She puts the tape 
down on a table.  She stares at it.  Fred comes in.

				FRED
		You're up early.

				RENEE
		That dog woke me.  I lay there for a
		while, then decided to get up.

				FRED
		Who the hell owns that dog?

Fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table.

				FRED
		What's that?  Another tape?

				RENEE
		Yes, I just found it on the step.

Fred picks it up.
	
				FRED
		Don't you want to watch it?

				RENEE
		I guess so.

Fred goes to the VCR and inserts the tape.  He turns the 
television on.  He is about to start the tape - he looks up 
for Renee.  She's hanging back.

				FRED
		Well, do you wanna watch it?

Again, Renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the 
tape, but she hides this from Fred and walks toward the 
couch.

				RENEE
		Yeah.

Renee sits on the couch.  Fred starts the VCR and joins her.

As before, we first see it on the TV, then the videotape 
fills the frame.  This tape shows the front of the house, as 
before, then shows the INTERIOR of Fred and Renee's house -
AT NIGHT.

The eerie DRONING SOUND goes throughout.

The camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings 
looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into 
their bedroom, where we see Fred and Renee sleeping.  The 
tape image then goes to snow.

Fred and Renee stare at the snowy TV picture.  After a few 
moments of silence, Renee gets up and switches off the set.  
She is visibly shaken, trembling.  She stares fearfully at 
Fred who seems less disturbed.

				RENEE
		We've got to call the police.

				FRED
		All right.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Renee is on the telephone.  Fred is pacing, smoking, behind 
her.

				RENEE
		...yes, I've been on hold for ten
		minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.

Renee looks around anxiously.  Fred gives her his cigarette, 
which she puffs on.  He lights another and continues pacing.

				RENEE
		Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee
		Madison... My husband is Fred Madison,
		the jazz musician... we	live at 442
		Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis...
		near the observatory... Someone's been in
		the house... at night... while we were
		sleeping... I know because they sent, 
		dropped off a videotape... two 
		videotapes... to show us... That's 
		right... Yes... it... the second one... 
		shows us asleep... Someone broke in and 
		taped us while we slept!... Isn't that 
		enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 
		Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.

Renee hangs up.

				FRED 
		So?

				RENEE
		Two detectives are coming out.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Two men in suits - the Detectives, ED and AL, are seated on 
the couch, watching the last part of the second videotape.  
The screen goes to snow and stays that way for several 
moments, until Fred shuts it off.


				FRED
		That's it.

				ED
		Let's have a look at the hallway outside
		the bedroom.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

All four of them go to the hallway, where Ed and Al look 
around, especially up toward the ceiling.

				AL
		Very strange.

				RENEE
		What is?

				AL
		The angle.  The high angle shot on the
		tape.

				ED
		How'd the camera get so high like that?

				AL
		And smooth... Almost no movement - back
		and forth, I mean.

				ED
		Like you'd get if it was hand held.

				AL
		Right ... This just glided along.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

The Detectives enter the bedroom.  Fred and Renee follow.

				ED
		This is the bedroom.

The Detectives look around without touching anything.

				AL
		Do you always sleep here?... In this
		room?... Both of you?


				FRED
		This is our bedroom.

				ED
		There's no other bedroom?

				FRED
		No... There is, I mean, I use it as a
		practice room... it's soundproofed.

				AL
		You're a musician?

				FRED
		Yes, I thought my wife ...

				ED
		What's your axe?

				FRED
		Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you...

				ED
			(shakes his head)
		Tone deaf.

				AL
			(to Renee)
		Do you own a video camera?

				RENEE
		No. Fred hates them.

The Detectives both look at Fred.

				FRED
		I like to remember things my own way.

				AL
		What do you mean by that?

				FRED
		How I remember them.  Not necessarily the
		way they happened.

				ED
		Do you have an alarm system?

				RENEE
		Yes, actually we do... but we haven't
		been using it.

				AL
		Why not?

				FRED
		It kept going off for some reason.  False
		alarms.

				ED
		Might be a good time to try using it
		again.

				AL
		Anybody else have a key to the house.

				RENEE
		No.

				AL
		Maid?  Relative?

				RENEE
		No, one of us is always here to let the 
		maid in.  Nobody else has a key.

				ED
			(to Al)
		Let's check the doors and windows... See
		if there's been a break-in.

They all leave the bedroom.

INT THE MADISON HOUSE FRONT DOOR - DAY

Ed is checking the door for marks.

Fred's POV: He's watching Ed and Al with Renee who are 
outside the house, walking around the property, checking 
it out.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Ed and Al are standing by an unmarked police car with Fred 
and Renee.  The Detectives are about to depart.

				AL

		We'll keep a watch on the house.

				ED
		As best we can.

				AL
		If anything else happens, you'll call us.
		Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card.

				RENEE
		We will.

				FRED
		Thanks, guys.

				ED
		It's what we do.

Ed and Al get into the car and drive off.  Renee and Fred 
look at each other, warily, then go back into the house.  THE 
CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS IN THE
VIDEOTAPE.

								FADE OUT:

								  CUT TO:

INT. LUNA LOUNGE - NIGHT

Fred is on the bandstand, sweating, and honking his
saxophone.  He handles the horn roughly, braying like a beast 
as the CROWD gathered in front of the stage gyrates as one 
swept away in the madness of the moment.

								CUT TO:

INT.  LUNA LOUNGE - SAME

At the back, near the side door, Renee can be seen with TWO 
MEN, only one of whose faces we see.  The trio are going out 
the side door led by one of the men; we see only the back of 
his head.  Renee glances briefly at the bandstand before she 
exits with the two men.

								CUT TO:

INT. LUNA LOUNGE - BANDSTAND - SAME

CLOSE UP OF	FRED as he plays, seemingly oblivious to his
surroundings. His eyes open and shut as he clamps down on
the horn.

In the back of the club, the side door slowly closes.

								FADE OUT:

								  CUT TO:

INT.  THE MADISON HOUSE - STAIRWELL / LIVING ROOM - DAY

Fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction 
of the stairwell.  We HEAR someone's steps coming up the 
stairs.  It's Renee, who eventually comes into view.  She is 
holding another manila envelope.  She arrives at the top 
step.

She and Fred lock eyes.

Fred takes the envelope, opens it, and pulls out a third 
videotape. without saying anything, Fred takes the tape to 
the VCR.  He inserts it very carefully, slowly.  He hits 
play, turns on the television and he and Renee sit down on 
the couch together and begin to watch with great 
apprehension.

Again we begin with a WIDE SHOT and then the TV monitor fills 
the screen: We see the interior of the house at night.  The 
camera glides looking down from a high angle along the 
hallway and into the bedroom, where Fred and Renee are 
sleeping.

Again, the DRONING SOUND plays throughout.

in the bedroom where Fred and Renee are seen sleeping, 
SUDDENLY, Fred, on the tape, slowly awakens as the camera 
holds on him.  He rises and turns unnaturally in the bed, as 
if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the 
room.  He comes to a sitting position, his head straining 
upwards, looking in the direction of the camera.  At this 
point, the videotape image turns to snow.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Fred and Renee are on the couch.  The TV remains on, showing 
snow.

Renee is very upset, crying.

				RENEE
		What the hell is going on?!

				FRED
			(equally horrified -
			frightened)
		I wish I knew.

Fred reaches over and tentatively takes Renee's hand in his.  
She trembles, allows him to touch her, but otherwise does not 
respond.  Suddenly, she jumps with fright.

				RENEE
		What was that?!!!

				FRED
		What?

				RENEE
		On the tape!  There was something else on
		the tape.

Fred gets up and rewinds it, passing an image.

				RENEE (CON'T)
		There!  Play it!

Fred runs the tape forward.

We see snow - then a half-second long MEDIUM SHOT of Fred on 
his knees near the bedroom wall on Renee's side of the bed.  
He is looking directly at the camera - his face a ghastly 
grimace, contorted.  His eyes are WIDE WITH HORROR.

Fred runs it back again and FREEZES the tape there on his 
tormented image.  This image fills the screen.  He and Renee 
stare at it.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Detectives, with Fred and Renee are seated on chairs and 
the couch.  The three videotapes in their manila envelopes 
are stacked on a coffee table in the center.

				AL
		You don't remember being awakened?  It
		looks like you were aware of someone.

				ED
		Or something.

				FRED
		No, I don't remember anything. it looks
		like I... but... I don't remember.

				RENEE
		Why would anyone do something like this?

				AL
		Has anyone made any threats to either of
		you recently?

				ED
		Or not so recently?

				FRED
		No, not to me.

Al, Ed and Fred all look at Renee.

				RENEE
		I...	no. No. No threats.

				ED
		We'll take the tapes with us, if that's
		all right with you?

Ed looks at Fred, then Renee, both of whom nod their 
agreement.

				AL
		We'll see that the patrol of the house is
		doubled.

				RENEE
		I don't know if I want to stay here.  I
		don't feel safe.

				FRED
		Where would you feel safe?

				RENEE
		I don't know. maybe a hotel.

Ed and Al are watching this exchange between Fred and Renee 
with keen interest.

There is a strained silence between them.

				ED
		Did you use the alarm system since we
		were here last?

				FRED
		The first night ... Not the last two.

				AL
		Why not?

				FRED
			(shrugs)
		I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of
		acting paranoid.

				RENEE
		Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our 
		house while we're sleeping, filming us, 
		and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I 
		thought you set the alarm!

Fred gets up, lights a cigarette, paces.

				FRED
		I'll make sure the alarm is set from now
		on.

				RENEE
		But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who
		is doing this?  And why?

Ed and Al rise from their chairs.  Ed picks up the envelopes.

				AL
		We'll find out, Mrs. Madison.

Renee stands with the Detectives.  Fred stands apart - his 
expression, pained and bewildered.

								CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A swinging party is in progress at Andy's house - the man
whose face we saw at the Luna Lounge with Renee.  ANDY, 37 
years old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, 
making small talk, kissing and being kissed.  The PEOPLE here 
are wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain-
wearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed 
provocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses.  Through 
sliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people 
cavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in his or 
her hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty
glass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, and 
dances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to be a 
bit intoxicated.

Fred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, 
makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. 
When the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then 
sets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows the 
other drink, too, and sets down the glass.

A MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than 
Fred, approaches him.

				MYSTERY MAN
		We've met before, haven't we?

				FRED
		I don't think so.  Where was it that you
		think we've met?

				MYSTERY MAN
		At your house.  Don't you remember?

				FRED
			(surprised)
		No, no I don't.  Are you sure?

				MYSTERY MAN
		Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now.

				FRED
			(incredulous)
		What do you mean?  You're where right
		now?

				MYSTERY MAN
		At your house.

				FRED
		That's absurd.

The Mystery Man reaches into his coat pocket, takes out a 
cellular phone and holds it out to Fred.

				MYSTERY MAN
		Call me.

Fred snickers, like this is a bad joke.  The Mystery Man puts 
the phone into Fred's hand.

				MYSTERY MAN
				(CON-T)
		Dial your number.

Fred hesitates, puzzled.

				MYSTERY MAN
				(CON-T)
		Go ahead.

Fred shrugs, laughs, dials his number. We HEAR a pick up as 
we stay on FRED'S FACE.

				PHONE VOICE OF 
				MYSTERY MAN
		I told you I was here.

Fred, still holding the phone, stares at the man standing in 
front of him.

				FRED
		How did you do that?

The Mystery Man points to the phone.

				MYSTERY MAN
				Ask me.

Fred, mirthful at first, as if it is a party trick of some 
kind, suddenly turns serious - it's obvious he's thinking now 
of the videotapes.  He speaks into the phone.

				FRED
			(angrily)
		How did you get into my house?

				PHONE VOICE OF
				MYSTERY MAN
		You invited me.  It's not my habit to go
		where I'm not wanted.

Fred looks at the man in front of him, but speaks again into 
the phone.

				FRED
		Who are you?

The man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person.

				PHONE VOICE OF
				MYSTERY MAN
		Give me my phone back.

The man in front of Fred reaches out his hand for the phone.  
Fred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone 
back to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket.

				MYSTERY MAN
		It's been a pleasure talking to you.

The man walks away from Fred.  Renee appears and comes up to Fred.

				RENEE
		I thought you were getting me a drink?

				FRED
		Just a minute.

He takes Renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the 
party, Andy.  He grabs Andy and points across the room toward 
the Mystery Man, who is engaged in conversation with OTHER 
GUESTS.

				FRED
		Andy, who is that guy?

				ANDY
			(looking at the Mystery Man)
		I don't know his name.  He's a friend of
		Dick Laurent's, I think.

				FRED
		Dick Laurent?

				ANDY
		Yes, I believe so.

				FRED
			(remembering something)
		But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

				ANDY
		He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick.
		How do you know he's dead?

Andy and Renee exchange a worried look, which Fred does not notice.

				FRED
		I don't.  I don't know him.

				ANDY
			(angrily)
		Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was
		dead?

				RENEE
		Honey, who?... Who's dead?

Fred takes Renee by the arm away from Andy.

				FRED
		Let's go home.

				RENEE
		But...

				FRED
		Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want
		to come here in the first place.

Fred drags the reluctant Renee out of Andy's house.

								CUT TO:

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Fred is driving fast and recklessly.  Renee is drunk and is 
smiling at him.

				FRED
		How'd you meet that asshole, Andy,
		anyway?

Renee stares out the front window - thinks back.

				RENEE
		It was a long time ago... I met him at 
		this place called Moke's... We... became 
		friends... He told me about a job...

				FRED
		What job?

				RENEE
		I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's 
		okay...

				FRED
		He's got some fucked up friends.

								CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Fred and Renee's car pulls up in front of their house.  Fred 
jumps out of the car.

				FRED
		Stay in the car!

Fred enters the house, careful to turn off the alarm first.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT

There are only a couple of dim lights on, the house is mostly 
dark.  Fred moves slowly and carefully through his house -
searching each room for a possible intruder.

Fred's POV - moving creepily room by room through the dark 
house - past the telephone - down the hall to the bedroom.

There is NO ONE there.

He goes back outside for Renee.

								CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Renee is standing next to the car, shivering.

				FRED
		I told you to stay in the car!

				RENEE
		Why? what is it?  Why did you make me
		wait out here?

				FRED
		I thought there might be somebody inside.

				RENEE
		Was there?

				FRED
		No... of course not.

They enter the house.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - NIGHT 

Fred switches on more lights.

				RENEE
		It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had 
		the strangest feeling... Like this had 
		happened before.  I mean, your telling me 
		to stay outside while you went in like 
		that.

Fred looks at Renee, then continues to look around the house, 
disturbed, seriously disquieted.  Renee, still tipsy, follows 
him, moving from room to room.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM, ETC. - NIGHT

Fred and Renee are preparing to go to bed. Renee goes	into
the bathroom off the bedroom. Fred takes another look	out
into the hallway.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Fred walks down the hallway.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Fred looks around the dark living room.  Then absentmindedly, 
he begins to inspect objects.  He picks up an ashtray and 
studies it - lost in thought.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Renee is washing her face, standing at the sink in her slip.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

Fred is staring at himself in a mirror.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Renee comes in.  Fred is not there.  She goes to the door and 
peeks down the hallway.

				RENEE
			(tentatively)
		Fred?  Fred, where are you?

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

No one is in the living room now - but a SHADOW moves slowly 
across a wall.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Renee's POV - down the hallway.  There is just darkness at 
the end of the hall.  It is EERIE.  After a moment, Fred 
slowly walks out of the darkness toward Renee.  He walks out 
of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of 
darkness at the end of the hall.

								FADE OUT:

								 FADE IN:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Footsteps can be heard on the stairs.  Fred's head appears at 
the top of the stairway.  He comes up into the living room 
carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously 
received.  His expression is strained.  He is alone.  Fred 
pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the 
VCR, turns it on.  He sits on the couch and watches.  We go 
from a WIDE SHOT to a FULL FRAME SHOT of the video.

On the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, 
accompanied by the DRONING SOUND.  The camera moves eerily 
down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle.  
The camera turns slowly into the bedroom - looking down.

BLOOD is splattered over the floor, bed, walls.  The camera 
drifts.  THE DEAD BODY OF RENEE lies on the floor at the foot
of the bed.  She is badly mutilated.  Fred is hovering over 
her on the tape, ON HIS KNEES, A HORRIFIED, UNBELIEVING 
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE.  On the tape, Fred turns away from 
Renee - his hands raised, dripping blood - her blood.  His 
movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains 
strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling 
some enormous pressure.  He looks directly at the camera, his 
face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped 
image goes to snow.

								CUT TO:

INT. THE MADISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Fred, sitting in front of the TV, shudders as the tape ends.  
He sits trembling, attempts to speak, almost chokes, and 
finally releases a tortured, warbly cry.

				FRED
		Renee!

Fred looks up as if seeing something, he starts to stand, 
-staggering, partially paralyzed.

				FRED (CON'T)
			(Shouting)
		RENEE!


								CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
Fred's POV: A BIG FIST slams into Fred's face, knocking him 
back in a chair.  Ed and Al are standing in front of Fred.

				ED
		Stay put, killer!

The Detectives' POV: Fred's face is a bloody mask.  He is 
crying, whimpering.

				FRED
		I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill
		her!

								CUT TO:

INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

Fred, his lips and eyes swollen, sits on a cot, dressed in 
jail clothes.  He studies his hands, which appear crippled.  
He flexes the fingers, slowly, painfully.

								CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DAY

We are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom 
and living room windows. Inside the house, INVESTIGATORS and 
FORENSIC EXPERTS are moving around, measuring, scraping 
samples of carpet, searching for fingerprints on furniture.

								CUT TO:

INT. CITY MORGUE - NIGHT

Renee's CORPSE on a slab is rolled into an examining room by 
an ATTENDANT.  The entrance of the body is shown reflected in 
a chrome-framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall.  The 
Attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a 
rack of instruments, positioning the corpse.  As he is doing 
these things, the MEDICAL EXAMINER enters, accompanied by his 
GIRLFRIEND.  The M.E. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo.  The 
young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, 
pearls, spike heels.  The couple are close; she has an arm 
through his, and she laughs, nervously.  He is smoking a 
cigarette.

				ATTENDANT
		Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?

				M.E.
		Party at the mayor's house, George.  This
		is his daughter, Joyce.

				ATTENDANT
		Howdy, Joyce.

				JOYCE
		Howdy, George.

The Attendant uncovers the body - individual parts are 
wrapped like packages from a butcher's shop, and labeled: L. 
ARM, HEAD, R. BREST (misspelled).

				M.E.
			(looking at the packages)
		Just like Christmas.

He begins to unwrap them.

				JOYCE
		I don't know if I can watch this.

The M.E. tosses his cigarette down on the floor.  The camera 
goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain; 
smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drain's 
filter screen.

				M.E.
			(Voice-over)
		Leave any time you want, lover.  I won't
		take it personally.

The camera stays on the drain as we HEAR the M.E. unwrapping 
the packaged body parts.  Joyce's high heels enter the frame 
around the drain.  She is stepping nervously, like a spooked 
horse.  The clatter of her heels is very loud.  We hear the 
M.E. chuckle.

				M.E.
			(Voice-over)
		Easy, girl, easy.

				JOYCE
		You talking to me or... her?

				M.E.
			(laughs)
		A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce.

								CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The camera is behind a female FOREMAN in the jury box.  The 
shot begins on her shoes and travels up her body as she
stands.  Over her left shoulder we see Fred standing at the
defense table. Over her right shoulder the JUDGE is seated.

				JUDGE
		Have you reached a verdict?

				FOREMAN
		Yes, we have, your honor.

				JUDGE
		Please hand it to the bailiff.

The BAILIFF goes to the Foreman, takes the paper from her, 
then takes it to the Judge.  The Judge opens it and reads it 
to himself, then hands it back to the Bailiff, who returns it 
to the Foreman.

				JUDGE
		And what is your verdict?

The camera moves to Fred, registering his tension.  The 
camera goes to the Foreman's face.

				FOREMAN
		We the jury find the defendant guilty of
		murder in the first degree.

Fred faints.  Fe is lifted up by his ATTORNEY and GUARDS in 
attendance.  Fred revives slightly.

				JUDGE
		Fred Madison, the jury having found you 
		guilty of murder in the first degree, it 
		is my order that on a date to be 
		determined, you be put to death in the 
		electric chair.

We see Fred's eyes roll open as he cranes his neck around and 
upwards, looking at the video camera high on the wall of the 
courtroom, pointing down on him.

								CUT TO:

INT. LINGERIE SHOP - DAY

MARIAN and RAQUEL, two exquisite young women, are looking 
over the merchandise.

				RAQUEL
		Did you see that about the guy who 
		chopped up his wife into a million 
		pieces?

				MARIAN
		How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit
		with that stuff.

				RAQUEL
		They're gonna cook him.

				MARIAN
		Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have 
		a choice... You can die by hanging or by 
		firing squad.

				RAQUEL
		Which would you choose?

Marian holds up a black teddy to her body.

				MARIAN
		Andy would go for this, don't you 
		think?... Firing squad, definitely.

				RAQUEL
		Do they aim for the head or for the
		heart?

				MARIAN
		The heart, I guess.

				RAQUEL
		I wouldn't... The brain would know what's 
		going on.  Your heart would be ripped 
		open trying to pump blood, blood pouring 
		into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, 
		Marian.

Raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest.

				MARIAN
		Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be
		hung, huh?

They both giggle at the obvious joke.

				RAQUEL
		Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, 
		you black out.  It might take a while for 
		the body to die, but you wouldn't feel 
		it.

Marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch.

				MARIAN
		You might be right, Raquel.

Marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and 
wiggles it.  The girls giggle.  Raquel sees Andy walking into 
the store.  He is sneaking up behind Marian, and motions with 
a finger to his lips to Raquel not to say anything.  When 
Andy gets directly behind Marian, he puts his hands over her 
eyes.

				ANDY
		Guess who?

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY

Fred, in the custody of GUARDS, wearing handcuffs and leg 
irons, is being escorted to his cell.  He appears zombie-like 
as the guards open the cell door, unlock and remove his 
shackles, and lock him in.

				GUARD
		Make yourself to home, fella.

The guards leave.  Fred stands near the cell door, begins to 
look around at the four walls, the single cot, the wash 
basin, and the toilet bowl without a seat.  He hears the 
muffled, DISTORTED NOISES - VOICES from the surrounding 
cells.  Lost voices - the voices of death row.  Fred 
realizes where he is now.  He walks over to the cot and 
slowly sinks down and sits on the edge.  Fred perched on the 
cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the 
middle of an ocean.

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - DAY

A TRUSTEE is pushing a meal cart along the row.  At each

INT. PRISON - EXERCISE YARD - DAY

This is a small narrow yard, not the large exercise yard for 
population.  This yard is for use by death row prisoners 
only, to exercise in one hour each day, by himself.  Fred is 
released into the area, which is more like a dog run.  The 
Guards watch Fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise 
yard.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - NIGHT

There is more activity on the row tonight than usual.  A 
COUPLE of MEN in suits walk through with an air of authority.

There is a building murmur among the prisoners.

Fred sits on the edge of his bed, listening as sound of 
the prisoners builds.  He's shaking.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRIS0N - DEATH ROW - NIGHT

TWO GUARDS are standing at the guard station.

				GUARD #1
			(very quietly - solemnly)
		Here he comes.

Several of the men in suits, along with several GUARDS, and a 
CLERGYMAN, a PRISONER in the middle of the group, enter the 
hallway.  They proceed past the guard station down the hall.  
As the procession files by, DEATH ROW INMATES come to their 
doors and talk to the prisoner.

				INMATE #1
		See you soon, Sammy.  Don't think takin' 
		a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me 
		back the twenty you owe me.

				INMATE #2
		Don't take it personal, pal.

				INMATE #3
		Un fuerte abrazo, amigo!

As the men march down the hallway, they pass Fred's cell.  
His window panel is empty.  The camera stops on Fred's cell 
door, as we HEAR other prisoners talking to the inmate on his 
way to the ELECTRIC CHAIR.

				INMATE #4
		Hang in there, honey.

				INMATE #5
		Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G.

								CUT TO:

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT

The prisoner is strapped into the electric chair.  Behind a 
glass partition WITNESSES are seated. One of the men in 
suits, the WARDEN, goes to a telephone on the wall and stands 
with his hand on the receiver.  He picks it up.

				WARDEN
			(into phone)
		Line check.
			(pause)
		Okay.

The Warden hangs up the telephone and stays next to it.

We see one of the condemned man's WRISTS being clamped with 
an electrical device.  The other wrist is clamped.

A metal halo is placed around the condemned man's head.  A 
large electrical cable leads off from the halo.

Electrically conductive ointment is smeared around the areas 
where the clamps have been placed.

The Clergyman moves close to the condemned man continuing to 
give the man his last rites.  When he is finished, he nods to 
the Warden.  The Warden approaches the condemned man.

				WARDEN
		Any final words, Sam?

The condemned man shakes his head "no".

The Warden and the others clear the room and the doors are 
locked.

The EXECUTIONER steps into place near a huge lever.  He looks 
to the Warden.

The Witnesses sit in silent anticipation.

The hands of the clock on the wall have moved past midnight.

The Warden takes one last look through a window at the 
condemned man - then nods to the Executioner.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT

Fred sits frozen at the edge on his bed.

A distant but LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM begins.

Fred's head jerks upward to the light on his ceiling.  It has 
dimmed to almost nothing.

Fred sits in the humming darkness.

							SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PRIS0N - EXERCISE YARD - DAY

The Guards release Fred into the yard for his exercise.  At 
first the sunlight is blinding, and Fred covers his eyes.  He 
moves along the wall, tentative, his fingers feeling the way.  
Fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned 
against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face.  Very 
soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is 
bathed in shade.  Fred stands up, but is almost immediately 
hit by a searing pain in his head.  Fred holds his head with 
his hands, sinks down to his knees.  The Guard, who has been 
observing Fred from the doorway, comes over to him.

				GUARD
		Something wrong?

				FRED
		My... My head.

				GUARD
		Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess.  
		You want to come in?  Still got forty-
		five minutes outside if you want it.

				FRED
		No, no.  I want to go in.

The guard assists Fred back inside the building.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - DAY

Fred is on his cot, holding his head.  He is obviously in 
pain.  He gets up and staggers to the cell door.  Fred pushes 
a CALL button next to the door to summon a guard.  The GUARD 
comes and speaks to Fred through a double mesh opening.

				GUARD
		What's botbering you, Madison?

				FRED
		The pain is getting worse.  I need more
		aspirin.

				GUARD
		I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to
		the doctor.

The guard leaves. Fred collapses to the floor of the cell,
writhing in pain.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - INFIRMARY   DAY

Fred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons, a GUARD 
on either arm.  He is placed on a chair in the middle of the 
room.  The guards stand one on each side of him.  A DOCTOR 
enters.  He is in late-middle age, with serious eyebrows.  
Fred's head is hanging down, chin on chest.  The Doctor lifts 
Fred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his 
face is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing.  The Doctor takes 
a light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's 
eyes.  He feels Fred's forehead.  After this, he allows 
Fred's head to drop down again.  The Doctor takes Fred's 
pulse.  He drops Fred's wrist.  He next takes Fred's blood 
pressure.

				DOCTOR
		You sleeping okay?

				FRED
			(strained whisper)
		I can't sleep.

The Doctor goes over to a cabinet, unlocks a drawer, and 
removes a large blue pill.  He fills a paper cup with water 
from a dispenser, goes back to Fred and places the pill in 
Fred's mouth.  The Doctor tilts Fred's head up and pours the 
water down his throat, some of it dribbling down the front of 
Fred's shirt.  The Doctor looks into Fred's mouth to make 
sure he swallowed the pill.

				DOCTOR
		You'll sleep now.
			(to Guards)
		Take him back to his cell.

The guards lift Fred by his arms, and shuffle march him out 
of the infirmary.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT

Fred awakens on his cot.  He turns and sits up in the 
darkness.  A stream of light through the slot window 
illumines Fred's head, the forehead of which is swollen and 
discolored.  He staggers up and shuffles over to the call 
button, which he leans on.  A few moments later, a GUARD 
appears on the other side of the mesh.

				GUARD
		What is it?

				FRED
		Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more
		aspirin.

				GUARD
		The doctor said not to give you anything.
		You can see him in the morning.

				FRED
		But my head...

The guard looks at Fred through the window, and what he sees 
disturbs him.  The guard makes a strange face.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - NIGHT

The guard walks away from Fred's door to the guard station, 
where another GUARD is sitting at a table, reading a 
magazine.

				GUARD #1
		Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty
		fucked up.

				GUARD #2
			(not looking up from his
			magazine)
		Which one?

They both laugh.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRIS0N - FRED'S CELL - SAME - NIGHT

Fred is on the floor lying on back. The camera comes 
slowly down at him from the ceiling, like a weight pressing 
on his head.  Fred's pain is demonstrably overwhelming him 
now.  He moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness, 
making grotesque, otherworldly sounds.  As the camera moves 
into a CLOSE UP, the last image of Fred's head shows the 
discolored swelling has increased.  Fred looks up, sensing 
something.

								CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADIS0N HOUSE - NIGHT

There is a "For Sale" sign posted in front.  The camera pans

The interior of the house is dark, but fleetingly we are 
aware of movement, shadows inside.

								CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marian and Raquel are in the living room, attired in the 
undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store.  HOT 
MUSIC is BLARING from a stereo.  Marian and Raquel are 
dancing, as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be.  
Andy is lying on his back on the rug, dressed only in 
undershorts and socks, the girls stomping feet stepping 
furiously around his head and body.  His eyes are closed at 
first, but when he opens them, he sees their feet in a blur.  
He tries to get up, but he is too strung out, and he 
collapses again.  Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and
feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance.  
Andy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts 
tumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, 
turns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy.  
Marian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, 
shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.  Andy 
makes another attempt to sit up - he looks at Marian, reaches 
for her but falls back, dead to the world.  Raquel and Marian 
don't quit.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - FRED'S CELL - NIGHT

Fred is still curled on the floor, but spasms begin to rock 
his body.  He goes into convulsions, blood gushes from his 
nostrils.  His head is badly swollen.  Fred vomits repeatedly, 
and drags around in his mess.  Fred turns, straining upwards 
as we've seen him do before.  His face and head are hideously 
deformed.

Fred brings his shaking, tortured hand to his forehead.  He 
pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes.  
As his hand passes over his face, Fred's features are removed 
leaving a blank, white mass with eye sockets.

We move into the eye sockets and beyond.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

We see a clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We are 
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
desert landscape.  This gliding, eerie POV continues until the 
headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the 
road.  This figure is a man, PETE DAYTON.  Pete turns, 
unsettled, as he looks directly at us as we move closer to 
him.  The ghost image of a house appears behind Pete.  There 
is a girl, SHEILA, standing on the lawn in front of the 
house.  She is afraid and is trying to communicate with Pete.  
Pete doesn't seem to hear her and continues to stare directly 
at us.  Now Pete seems to move toward us as we move toward 
him.  His head fills the screen.

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW - MORNING

A GUARD is making his early morning rounds.  He stops at each 
cell and looks in, making a mark with a pencil on a piece of 
paper on a clipboard. when he comes to Fred's cell, he is 
about to make a check-mark, but looks in again and appears 
confused.  THE MAN INSIDE IS NOT FRED.

				GUARD
		Who are you?  What are you doing in this
		cell?

The MAN in the cell sits still on the cot, staring straight 
ahead.  The man is thin, younger than Fred.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - DEATH ROW HALLWAY - MORNING

The guard hurries over to the guard station.  He picks up the
telephone and dials.  He begins to sweat.

				GUARD
		This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah, 
		look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I 
		mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No, 
		there's somebody in there, but it ain't 
		Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain 
		Henderson's comin''?... Right.

Johnny Mack hangs up.  He sweats.  He walks back down the row 
and looks in again at Fred's cell.

				JOHNNY MACK
		F-u-u-u-ck me!

He walks back to the station.  A supervisor arrives, CAPTAIN 
HENDERSON.
	
				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Now, Mack, what's the situation?

				JOHNNY MACK
		I'm not entirely certain, Captain.
		You'll have to see for yourself.

Together they walk quickly to Fred's cell and look in.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		That's not Fred Madison?

				JOHNNY MACK
		No, sir, it's not.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Who is it?

				JOHNNY MACK
		I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?

INT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Captain Henderson is standing in front of a desk, behind 
which the Warden is seated.  A nameplate on the desk reads: 
WARDEN MARSHALL R. CLEMENTS.

				WARDEN
		Repeat that, Bill.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred
		Madison in that cell.

				WARDEN
		Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else
		could it be?

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		I don't know.  The guards say they've
		never seen him before.

				WARDEN
		Where is he now?

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		He's in the infirmary, being examined.

				WARDEN
		Did you ask him who he is?

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		He... He can't talk. it appears as if he
		can't talk, anyway.

				WARDEN
		If he's not Madison, then where's
		Madison?

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		I've got men searching the building and
		the grounds now.

The Warden stands up and comes around the desk.

				WARDEN
		I want to take a look at this man myself.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - INFIRMARY - DAY

The man from Fred's cell is just finishing being 
fingerprinted.

The doctor with serious eyebrows - DR. ROGOFF - is inspecting 
the man's face.  The Warden enters with Captain Henderson.
GUARDS are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the
room.

				WARDEN
		What is this, Rogoff?

				DR. ROGOFF
		I don't know yet.

Dr. Rogoff begins to draw blood from the man's arm. He takes
several vials.  The man watches the blood coming out of his
arm, but doesn't seem to understand where he is or what is 
happening to him.

				WARDEN
		Who is this man?

				DR. ROGOFF
		He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll 
		run these blood tests right away.  We'll 
		find out soon enough.

Dr. Rogoff opens the man's mouth and peers in with a pencil 
light.

				WARDEN
		He's not Madison?

				DR. ROGOFF
			(slowly, deliberately
		Not even close.

Dr. Rogoff stands up, puts the light in his breast pocket.

				DR. ROGOFF (CON'T)
		I examined Madison last night, Marshall.
		He had a headache.

				WARDEN
		A headache?

				DR. ROGOFF
		I did a routine once-over, and gave him a 
		sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man 
		before.  Neither have the guards.  I 
		don't think he's in the system.

The Warden moves closer to the man - he looks closely at him.

				WARDEN
		Where the hell did you come from, mister?

CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - he's staring straight up.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Present are the Warden, Captain Henderson and TWO other 
PRISON OFFICIALS.  The Warden is looking at a computer next 
to his desk.

				WARDEN
		Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger
		is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
		He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday
		is April 21st.  He was born and raised
		right here.  He lives with his parents,
		William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland
		Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five
				(MORE)

				WARDEN (cont'd)
		years ago for auto theft, for which he 
		was put on probation for one year.  That 
		was his first and only offense.  No 
		record since then.

Warden Clements looks up, takes a deep breath and stares at 
the men in front of him.

				WARDEN (CON-T)
		How about Madison?  Have we had even a
		hint of his whereabouts?

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an 
		APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed 
		nationwide.

				PRISON OFFICIAL #1
		I had a call from the governor's office
		about this.

				WARDEN
		How the hell does she know?

				PRISON OFFICIAL #1
		There's press outside right now.

				WARDEN
		How the hell... 7



				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		One of the guards must have leaked it.

				WARDEN
		What's the word on the street?

				PRISON OFFICIAL #2
		Only that Madison has apparently escaped.
		Nothing about the other guy.

				WARDEN
		Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid

Johnny Mack looks around, up and down the walls, half peers 
under the cot, then - checking first to see no other guard is 
watching him - he looks inside the toilet bowl, then gets 
down on his knees and really looks under the cot.  He gets up 
and sits down on the bed.  He rubs a hand over his face.  
Johnny Mack is clearly perplexed.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

A press conference is being held.  Present are REPORTERS, TV 
cameras, et al.  The Warden and Captain Henderson represent 
the prison.

				WARDEN
		I have a statement to read... Fred 
		Madison, an inmate being held on death 
		row has, apparently... has escaped.  An 
		all-points bulletin has been issued to 
		authorities not only statewide, but 
		nationwide.  We are confindent that he

				REPORTER
		Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death

The Warden and Captain Henderson leave the room without 
answering.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - LONG CORRIDOR - DAY

Pete's parents, BILL and CLAIRE DAYTON, escorted by a PRISON 
GUARD, are approaching the Warden's office.  It is a long 
walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in 
detail as they get closer and closer to the office.  The 
Daytons are a middle-aged, San Fernando Valley couple.  Bill 
Dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short-sleeves rolled 
up. His skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is 
slicked back in a duck-tail.  He's working-class, ex-biker.  
Claire Dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone 
to seed from too much sun, cigarettes and booze.  She retains 
the remnants of a good figure, but it's going fast.  Claire 
is wearing sunglasses.

								CUT TO:

INT. PRISON - WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

The Daytons are ushered in by the guard.  The Warden is 
standing behind his desk.  Dr. Rogoff is standing to one 
side, and next to him is Captain Henderson.  The Daytons 
stand just inside the room for a moment before the Warden 
extends his right hand.

				WARDEN
		I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain 
		Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit 
		down.

Bill and Claire move to the chairs in front of the desk and 
sit down.  The Warden, Dr. Rogoff and Captain Henderson all 
sit down.

				WARDEN (CON'T)
		Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told 
		over the phone, your son, Peter, is here.

Claire Dayton removes her sunglasses.  She and Bill wait -
the warden is searching for words.

				WARDEN (CON'T)
		He... He was discovered this morning... 
		in a cell on death row.

Bill and Claire look at each other - bewildered.

				WARDEN (CON'T)
		A cell that was supposed to be
		occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.

				BILL
		The wife killer?

				WARDEN
		Yes.

				CLAIRE
		How is this possible, Warden?

The warden shakes his head.

				WARDEN
		...Tell me, what was Peter's condition 
		the last time you saw him?

Bill and Claire look at each other again - briefly.

				BILL
		His condition?  What do you mean?

				WARDEN
		His physical condition.

				BILL
			(hesitates)
		Same as always.  Pete takes care of
		himself.

Bill and Claire look at each other once again.

				CLAIRE
		I saw him before he went to the garage 
		day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. 
		Look, is he okay?  Can we see him?

The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff.

				DR. ROGOFF
		He has a hematoma on his forehead and a 
		condition called blepharitis... that's 
		redness and swelling around the eyes.

				BILL
		Was he in a fight?

				DR. ROGOFF
		These conditions don't indicate a fight.

				CLAIRE
		But what is the cause then? ... And how
		did he get in that cell?

				DR. ROGOFF
		He can't talk.  Or won't.

				BILL
		That doesn't sound like Pete.

				DR. ROGOFF
		Your son has experienced some sort of 
		trauma, I'm afraid.  We were hoping that 
		the two of you could help explain the 
		cause of the trauma and how he came to be 
		here.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		You don't know Fred Madison?

				BILL
		No... Only what was in the news.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Do you think Pete knows him?

				CLAIRE
		I wouldn't know how.

				WARDEN
			(to Claire)
		You say you haven't seen your son since
		the day before yesterday?

				CLAIRE
		When he went to work, right.

				WARDEN
		What about yesterday?

				CLAIRE
		He didn't come home.

				BILL
		Sometimes he stays at a friend's.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Any particular friends?

				BILL
		A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's 
		his own man; he comes and goes as he 
		pleases.

				CLAIRE
		I want to see him.

				WARDEN
		Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we
		can.
			(to Dr. Rogoff)
		Mel, let's get Peter in here.

Dr. Rogoff leaves the room.  While he's gone, nobody talks, 
increasing the tension.  Dr. Rogoff returns with Pete Dayton, 
dressed in his own clothes: jeans, boots, sport shirt.  
Pete's forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen.  
He can walk, but unsteadily.

Pete looks around the room - sees his parents.

Claire jumps up.

				CLAIRE
			(tenderly)
		Pete...

She and Dr. Rogoff help get Pete settled in a chair.  Bill is 
taken aback at the sight of his son, but says nothing.

				WARDEN (CON'T)
		Pete, can you tell us now, anything about
		this?

				CLAIRE
		Pete, what happened to you?

Pete has a dazed look on his face.  He starts to speak, then 
stops.

				CLAIRE (CON'T)
		It's okay.  Take your time, honey.

Pete's gaze drifts from his mother's face around the room and 
back to her face.

				PETE
			(afraid - quiet)
		Where ... am I?

The Warden and Captain Henderson look to Dr. Rogoff.

				DR. ROGOFF
		You're in the state penitentiary.  You
		were found in a cell on death row.

				PETE
		My head hurts.

Pete rubs his head like it's about to explode with pain.

				WARDEN
		A man named Fred Madison was occupying 
		that cell.  He's missing. we're trying 
		to find out how it is you were in there 
		and not him.

				PETE
		I... I don't know.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		Do you know Fred Madison?

				PETE
			(straining)
		No.

There is a silence in the room, as Pete massages his 
throbbing temples.

				CLAIRE
			(worried)
		Warden, can we take him home?

The Warden looks at Dr. Rogoff.

				DR. ROGOFF
			(to Warden)
		From a medical standpoint, I don't see
		why not.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
		We need to find out what happened here.

				BILL
			(standing up)
		Have you made any charges against him?

				WARDEN
		No.

				BILL
		Then he's coming home with his mother and
		me.

				WARDEN
		All right... but you see our 
		predicament... Legally we can't hold 
		him, but he may be able to help us... 
		perhaps later.  For now, he's free to 
		leave.

Bill and Claire help Pete up and carefully escort him out of 
the warden's office. With a nod from the Warden, the guard 
accompanies them out of the room.  The Warden, Captain 
Henderson and Dr. Rogoff stand but remain in the office.

				CAPTAIN HENDERSON
			(to warden)
		You just gonna let him go?

				WARDEN
		We'll get a tail put on him.

Pete sits down on his bed and looks up at his parents -
shaking his head with confusion and embarrassment.

				BILL
		Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be
		okay.

Bill's ear.  Bill nods and Claire walks quietly down the 
hallway and opens Pete's door.

She looks in on him sleeping.

EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - DAY

An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from the 
Dayton house.  In the front seat are the Detectives, Ed and 
Al. Al, who is on the passenger side, is holding two 
styrofoam cups filled with coffee.  Ed removes from his 
inside jacket pocket a 5" x 7" photo of Pete Dayton, which he 
props up on the dashboard so that it is visible for both 
himself and Al.  Al hands one of the cups to Ed.

				ED
		Thanks, Al.

Al studies Pete Dayton's face in the photo.

Pete slowly moves up to a sitting position, then stands.  He 
stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry, 
unwatered lawn on his bare feet.

He walks over and leans over the neighbor's fence.  His eyes 
fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b child's plastic
swimming pool.  He watches the boat as the warm breeze blows 
it lazily in a circle.

A small plane drones overhead.

In the distance, a WOMAN finishes hanging out some wash and 
goes in the back door of her house.  The slamming of her 
screen door sounds a thousand miles away.

Pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful 
surroundings - but something doesn't feel right to him.

								CUT TO:

INT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT

Pete is eating a sandwich - he is looking much better.
Claire opens a bag of chips and sets them in front of Pete as 
Bill comes in the front door.

Bill comes in and pops a beer - looks around.

				BILL
		Where's Pete?

				CLAIRE
		Out in back.

				BILL
		You talk to him?

				CLAIRE
			(urgent)
		No... Here he comes.

Their gazes follow a path from the backyard into where Pete 
has been sitting all the time.

				BILL
		How're you feelin'?

Pete looks at his parents - he can't figure out what has just 
happened.

				PETE
			(unsure - brow furrowed)
		Better.

				BILL
		Arnie called this morning while you were 
		sleepin'.  They miss you pretty bad down

				PETE
		Okay.  Thanks.

				PETE
		What night is that?

				BILL
		The night before you showed up in the

				CLAIRE

Bill and Claire just stare at him.  Pete shakes his head and 
takes another bite of his sandwich - but inside the worrisome 
feeling returns.

INT. DAYTON HOUSE - PETE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pete is stretched out on his bed watching television.  He 
hears the front door bell ring - footsteps, and a moment or 
two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his 
friends, CARL, LANIE and STEVE ("V") saunter in.

				"V"
		Where the fuck have you been?

Pete pulls himself up to a sitting position.

				PETE
		Hey.

				CARL
		You look like shit.

				LANIE
		What happened?

				PETE
		Just haven't been feelin' well.

				"V"
		You're not contagious are you?

				PETE
		I don't think so.

				"V"
		Good... You up for a drive?

				PETE
		Where to?  Hey, Lanie, I heard you were
		out of it for a while, too.

				LANIE
		They found a cyst on my god damn ovary.  
		Had to cut it out.  You wanna see the 
		scar?

Lanie pulls up her shirt and pulls down her pants a ways
revealing a fresh scar about three inches long.

				CARL
			(winking)
		Hadn't slowed her down none.

				LANIE
			(smacking him)
		Shut up, bone-head.

Then Lanie laughs good-naturedly.

				"V"
		Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten

				PETE
		Sheila'll be at "Tops".

				"V"
		Sure, what's wrong with that?

				PETE
		Okay.

Pete hauls himself up off the bed and throws on a black
leather jacket.

The four of them go through the living room where Bill and 
Claire are drinking and watching TV.

				PETE

		Goin' out with these clowns for a while.

"V" drives a black, beat-up '66 Grand Prix.  Carl and Lanie 
are in the back seat, and Pete rides shotgun.  The four of 
them., are cruising down Van Nuys Boulevard along with many 
other MUSCLE CARS and LOW-RIDERS filled with KIDS looking for
action. "V's" car is making a hell of a noise.

				PETE
		I hate ridin' in this fuckin' car.

				CARL
		Take it easy, Pete, "V" loves this rod.

				"V"
		Look at that goin' my way.

"V" has seen a couple. of GIRLS in short, tight dresses 
walking up the boulevard.

				"V" (CON'T)
		Oh my, oh my.

				LANIE
		Keep it in your pants, "V".

Some big cars nearby rev their engines.  "V" guns his car and 
it lurches roughly forward.  The sound of the rough running 
engine reverberates in Pete's brain.

				PETE
		This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment,
		Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?

				"V"
		Texaco... What's wrong with that?

				PETE
		Listen.

				"V"
		You gotta be kiddin'... This is the 
		boulevard... You can't hear yourself 
		think.

Pete shakes his bead with disgust.

"V" pulls the car off the boulevard into "Tops" drive-in.  
Cars are lined up at the "to go" window and all along the 
side of the building where people are hanging out under a 
long metal awning.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

"V" pulls into a parking spot by the awning.  The headlights 
illuminate a group of HIPSTERS - some dancing, some just 
hanging out.  THREE or FOUR GIRLS hanging out together turn 
toward "V's" car.  They see Pete in the front seat, and one 
of the girls, Sheila, smiles and walks toward him.

				SHEILA
		Hey.  Where have you been?

Pete talks to her through the open window while "V", Carl and 
Lanie climb out through "V's" door.  "V" leans back in.

				"V"
			(to Pete)
		You want somethin'?

				PETE
		No, I'm okay.

"V" walks off with the others to the "take out" window.
Sheila leans in closer to Pete.

				SHEILA
		I missed you.

				PETE
		Yeah?...

				SHEILA
		Yeah.

Sheila's girlfriends saunter over and lean on the car around 
her - looking in at Pete.

				GIRL #1
		What happened to your face?

				PETE
		Nothin'.

				SHEILA
		What are you guys doin'?

				PETE
		Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".

				SHEILA
		You want some company?

				PETE
		Sure.

"V", Carl and Lanie return with burgers and drinks.  "V's" 
got a mouthful of burger.

				"V"
			(muffled)
		What's happenin'?

				PETE
		They're comin' with us.

				"V"

		Pile in.

Sheila and her girlfriends jump in the car with "V", Carl, 
Lanie and Pete.  "V" fires up the rough-running engine and 
pulls out - leaving behind a cloud of smoke.

INT. TEN PIN BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

The bowling alley is divided into a game room area, a bar/ 
restaurant area and a bowling area.

Pete and the group stroll into the bar and take a large 
booth.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

A WAITRESS takes orders for drinks.

Bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance.

"V" takes one of Sheila's friends and dances with her.

Sheila takes Pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance.  The 
music is fast, but they dance slow.

				SHEILA
		Why haven't you called me?

				PETE
		Sorry... I...

Sheila looks around and moves closer to Pete.  She whispers 
urgently, worried.

				SHEILA
			(whispering)
		What's happening to you?  What happened
		to your face?

				PETE
		I don't know.

				SHEILA
			(whispering)
		What do you mean? ... You've been acting

				PETE
		What night?

				SHEILA
		Last time I saw you.

				PETE
		I don't remember... What happened that

				SHEILA
		You sure weren't acting like the Pete

				PETE
		Whatiya mean?

				SHEILA
		You were acting like a different person.

Pete laughs, but Sheila doesn't.

				PETE
		Who else could I be7

Sheila stares seriously at Pete, but then laughs too.

				SHEILA
		I don't know.

Sheila leans in very close to Pete and whispers in his ear.

				SHEILA (CON'T)
		You still care about me?

				PETE
		Sure.  Sure I do.

Sheila pushes her mouth on Pete's and they kiss., Pete breaks 
away - looks at Sheila - serious.

				PETE (CON'T)
		What else about that night?... Did

				SHEILA
		You really don't remember?

				PETE
		No... I told you.

				PETE
		Sure.

Arnie waves to Mr. Eddy from the office.

Pete comes up out of the well and turns.  When he sees Mr. 
Eddy, he heads across ihe garage to greet him.  Mr. Eddy 
opens his arms wide and embraces Pete.  When he pulls away, 
he sees Pete's face.

				MR. EDDY (CON'T)

Mr. Eddy drives.  Pete is in the passenger seat up front, and 
the two, stone-faced assistants ride in back.

				MR. EDDY
		Now listen... It only happens when I'm 
		accelerating.  I think it's the 
		carburetors.

Mr. Eddy pulls out after a light turns green and gives the 
car a stab forward.

				PETE
		No, it's not the carburetors.  Pull over,
		but keep it runnin'.

Mr. Eddy smiles as he pulls over.

				MR. EDDY
		Best god damn ears in town.
			(to the guys in back)
		You guys are lookin' at him.  The man
		with the best god damn ears in town.

When the car stops, Pete gets out, pops the hood and 
disappears down by the engine.

Mr. Eddy sits, smiling at Pete as he works.

Pete pops up and gives Mr. Eddy the "thumbs up" and gets back 
into the car.

				PETE
		Give that a try.

				MR. EDDY
		All right!

Mr. Eddy carefully pulls out into traffic and accelerates 
when he gets the chance.

				MR. EDDY (CON'T)
		Beautifull Smooth as shit from a duck's

Mr. Eddy hangs a right turn and heads up into the hills.

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAY

Mr. Eddy takes the big Pullman along the scenic Mulholland 
Drive - cruising smoothly.  A silver-gray Infiniti is moving 
up fast behind the Mercedes.

								  CUT TO:

INT. MR. EDDY'S 600 PULLMAN - DAY

Mr. Eddy looks into his rearview mirror.

				MR. EDDY
		Oh, shit... Is that what I think it is?

Pete turns and looks back.  A car is TAILGATING them, the 
silver-gray Infiniti.  The two assistants in the backseat 
turn nonchalantly to take a look - then they return their 
look to Mr. Eddy.

Mr. Eddy starts to take a slow burn - keeps looking at the 
Infiniti in the rearview mirror.

The assistants look to one another take a deep breath.

Mr. Eddy slows slightly and then keeps the Pullman steady at 
32 m.p.h. The Infiniti moves up ten feet behind the Pullman, 
and blows its horn.

Mr. Eddy rolls down his window.

The assistants are paying close attention - they buckle their 
seatbelts.

Pete notices a tension in the car.  He watches Mr. Eddy's 
face.

Mr. Eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road, pastes a 
polite, courteous smile on his face, puts his left arm out 
the window and waves the Infiniti by.

The Infiniti jets forward and swerves around the Pullman.  
When the cars are side by side, the irate DRIVER in the 
Infiniti gives Mr. Eddy "the bird" and flies past.

CLOSE ON MR. EDDY'S RIGHT FOOT as it slams down on the gas 
pedal.

The Pullman catapults forward toward the Infiniti.

Pete is thrown back - he grabs on to the door handle and the 
seat for support.

The Pullman gains on the Infiniti in a flash.  The Infiniti 
tries to go faster, but Mr. Eddy's Pullman has much more 
power.

				MR. EDDY
			(clenched teeth)
		This is where power and mechanical
		excellence pays off.

Mr. Eddy jams the Pullman into the back of the Infiniti and 
pushes it faster and faster along Mulholland.  The Driver of 
the Infiniti tries to brake and blue-gray smoke streams out 
from beneath the Infiniti with a scream of burning rubber.

At a turn, Mr. Eddy steers his massive Mercedes and the 
Infiniti ahead on a gut-wrenching path off the road, up a 
mountain and into a little glade of trees.  Dust and brush 
fly everywhere.

Mr. Eddy and his assistants leap from the Pullman and make 
for the Driver's side of the Infiniti.

Mr. Eddy throws open the Infiniti's door and pulls the 
trembling and screaming Driver out like a rag doll.

Mr. Eddy pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and pistol whips 
the Driver to the ground.  He smashes the butt of his gun 
across the man's face, tearing a gash which starts to gush 
with blood.

Mr. Eddy's assistants each draw .45's and point them at the 
Driver.

Mr. Eddy, red-faced with anger, leans close to the man.

				MR. EDDY
		DON'T YOU EVER FUCKIN' TAILGATE.

Mr. Eddy hits the Driver in the side of the head with his 
gun.

				MR. EDDY (CON'T)
		WHAT DID YOU SAY?

				DRIVER
			(scared shitless)
		I...	I didn't say anything...

		Tell him you won't tailgate.

		I won't ever tailgate.

		DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS

		HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! 
		YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... 
		IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD 
		HAVE HIT ME.  I WANT YOU TO GET A

				DRIVER
		I'll get a manual.
			(almost a whisper)
		and study it.

				MR. EDDY
			(kicking the man)
		FUCKIN' "A".

Mr. Eddy and his assistants return to the Pullman - get in 
and slam their doors.

Mr. Eddy throws the Pullman into reverse and pulls back off 
the hill onto Mulholland Drive.  He eases the car into 
"drive" and leaves the crying and beaten tailgater behind.

INT. MR. EDDY'S 600 PULLMAN - DAY

Mr. Eddy rotates his neck - shaking out some adrenaline 
remnants.  Pete is visibly shaken by what he has seen.

				MR. EDDY
		Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is
		one thing I can't tolerate.

				PETE
		I can see that.

				MR. EDDY
		I'll bet you know how many car lengths it

puts them into Pete's hand.

				PETE
		Thanks, Mr. Eddy.

				MR. EDDY
		No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the

Mr. Eddy reaches into the glove compartment and takes out a

He fires up the big engine and heads off for work.

Ed and Al follow.

								DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ARNIE'S GARAGE - DAY

Pete is on a skate - working under a car.  The radio is on 
and a tune comes on that begins to drive Pete crazy - it 
gives him a headache.  The tune is one of Fred Madison's be-
bop saxophone pieces.  Pete gets out from under the car and 
goes to the radio.  He changes the station.  PHIL, another 
mechanic working nearby, looks at Pete.

				PHIL
		Why'd you change it?  I liked that.

				PETE
		Well, I didn't.

Pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the 
car, he lays on the skate - unable to work.

A car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the 
garage.

Pete looks up - from under the car he sees the wheels of a 
Cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors.  He sees
a car door open and Mr. Eddy's feet appear and walk in his 
direction.

Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car.  He 
stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees -
back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the
car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like 
Renee.

CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except
she is about eight years younger.  The girl is staring right 
into Pete's eyes.

Mr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from 
Pete.  Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting 
on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between 
Pete and the girl.

				MR. EDDY
		I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. 
		Think you'll get a chance to give her a 
		once over today?

				PETE
			(regaining his composure)
		Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy.  You gonna pick
		it up later, or tomorrow?

				MR. EDDY
		If you think you can finish it, I'll be
		back later today.

				PETE
		It'll be ready.

				MR. EDDY
		You're my man, Pete.


Mr Eddy pinches Pete's cheek - which Pete doesn't like, but 
aliows.  Mr. Eddy gives Pete a big smile then turns, goes 
back to his car, escorts the beautiful girl outside where the 
Pullman is waiting.

Pete watches her walk and move.  He watches her until Mr. 
Eddy drives her away.  She steals one last glance back at 
Pete before she disappears.

When she is gone, Pete replays the scene of seeing this 
beautiful girl over again in his mind.  The scene is 
accompanied by Lou Reed's version of "This Magic Moment".

INT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT

Pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his 
bed.  He HEARS a succession of highly-amplified SOUNDS at 
intervals with eerie stretches of silence: CRICKETS in 
fractured cadence a distant TELEVISION - a FLY buzzing 
slowly in the room a MOTH'S wings beating against light 
bulbs in the ceiling fixture - the washing of DISHES.

Pete's reaction to these sounds is one of petrified 
confusion.  Underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly, 
steady DRONE.

Pete gets up off the bed, unsteadily.  He moves toward his 
bedroom door.  As he moves the amplified SOUNDS shift.

He can hear laughter.  The laughter seems to be LOUD, but at 
the same time coming from people who are trying to contain 
the laughter - to hide it.

Pete opens his door and peers out.

Pete's POV down the hall toward the living room - his mother 
and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty 
smiles in his direction.  They are smoking a joint, passing 
it back and forth.  They are not looking directly at him.  
They seem to be looking, but not seeing.

Pete's parents POV down the hall toward Pete's room.  There 
is no one there - just an empty hallway.

Pete's parents continue to stare, but then turn away toward 
each other - they start to laugh quietly again.

Pete's Pov - the hallway and the living room - there is no 
one in the living room. It's empty.

streaming into an empty coffee cup.  The camera stays on the 
top of Al's head until he has completed the last few spurts 
of his micturition.  Al's head comes up and he opens the 
passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street.  He 
closes the door and zips up his trousers.

He drives past "Tops", but doesn't see anyone he knows.

He turns off the boulevard and drives through San Fernando 
valley neighborhood streets.

He pulls up in front of Sheila's house and honks his horn.

He lights a cigarette while he waits.

In a few minutes Sheila comes out and leans in the passenger 
side window.

				SHEILA

Pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the 
car.

He cuts the engine, turns to Sheila and kisses her.  She 
breaks away.

				SHEILA
		Why don't you like me?

				PETE
		I do like you, Sheila.

Sheila puts her lips up' close to his and whispers.

				SHEILA
		How much?

Pete kisses her and she kisses him back.  They start to feel

wearing no bra and Pete begins to feel her breasts while she 
unbuttons his shirt.  They continue to kiss hard throughout.

Pete is ragging off some grease from his hands when he

Alice looks hard at him, then smiles.

Alice walks to the office inside the garage - picks up the

Just inside the room Alice takes Pete's hand and they turn to

Alice steals a look back.

At a tralfic light, Pete revs up the big Camaro and expertly

between two cars going in opposite directions - blasts up a 
block and hangs a hard right - disappearing from view.

Ed and Al go out into the traffic after them, but the

Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers".  He spots 
"V's" car parked at "Tops".

He pulls in beside "V's" car and shuts down the engine.  The 
usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila.

Pete goes up to "V" and Carl and says hello.  He lights a 
cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the 
awning above.  "V" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad 
mood.

Sheila is over with her girlfriends.  She hasn't seen Pete 
arrive.

Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction.  She looks 
like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything.  She 
keeps looking - staring.

Sheila's POV she sees "V", Carl and a lot of PEOPLE, but 
Pete is not there.

Pete looks at Sheila.  He's unsettled and confused by her 
staring, but not seeming to see him.  He watches her turn 
away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out 
to dance to the LOUD music.

Pete watches her dance.  Suddenly, he can't see her.  He 
thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the 
building - out of view.  He moves to look and his head is 
struck by a violent pain.  He grabs his head with his hand 
and leans forward.  "V" grabs his arm.

				"V"
		You okay, man?

				PETE
		What?

				"V"
		You okay?... What's wrong7

Pete looks up at "V".  He doesn't seem to recognize him -
"V's" head is a featureless blur.  Pete shakes his head 
trying to drive out the pain.

He looks over again for Sheila.  He sees her there dancing 
with her girlfriend.

				"V"
		Pete... You okay?

				PETE
		Yeah.

Pete stands back up against the post - turns to "V" -
recognizing him.

				PETE (CON'T) 
		I'm, okay... You okay?

				"V"
		Sure, I'm okay.

Some drunk GUYS move over to Sheila and her girlfriend.  They 
cut in on the girls.  The guy with Sheila puts his hand 
around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind.  
She tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter -
laughing with his buddy.

"V" and Carl look at Pete as he pushes off the post.  Pete 
crosses quickly to the man dancing with Sheila.  He slams his 
fist into the man's nose - almost snapping the man's neck in 
the process.  The man goes down bleeding.

Pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready 
for a fight.  He hits the man in the gut - the man's head 
goes down and Pete brings his knee up cracking the man's 
face.  The man's torso flies up with Pete's knee - then 
continues on as the man falls to the floor.  Pete picks him 
up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off.

Pete stands and turns - pulsating with anger.  Sheila is 
there beside him.

				SHEILA
		Where'd you come from?

				PETE
		I've been here.  You were lookin, right
		at me.

				SHEILA
		I was?

				PETE

Sheila sinks into his arms.

the same bed, as with Alice.

				SHEILA
			(whispered pain)
		Pete... Pete...

Pete keeps on - harder - obsessed. When he comes, he crashes 
down on Sheila, who wraps her arms around him tight.  She 
doesn't know what is going on with him.  Her eyes are open 
wide as she listens to his frantic breathing.

She doesn't know what to say - or what questions to ask.

				PETE
		Hey.

		Sit down a minute.

				PETE
		What's up?

				BILL
		Sit down.

Pete sits in a chair opposite Bill and Claire.

				BILL (CON'T)
		You don't look so good.

				PETE
		I gotta headache... What's goin' on?

				BILL
		The police called us.

				PETE
		Yeah? what did they want?

				BILL
		They wanted to know if we'd had a chance 
		to find out what happened to you the 
		other night.  They wanted to know if you 
		remembered anything.

				PETE
		But I don't remember anything.  What did
		you tell 'em?

				CLAIRE
			(whispers)
		We saw you that night, Pete.

				BILL
		You came home.  Your friend Sheila
		brought you here.

				PETE
		Sheila?

				BILL
		Yes, there was a man with you... She 
		brought you here... She didn't know what

				PETE
		What is this? Why didn't you tell me?
		What?... I don't remember any of this.

				CLAIRE
		We know that.

				PETE
		Who was the man?

				BILL
		Never saw him before in my life.

				PETE
		Did you tell the police this?

				BILL
		We're not saying anything about that 
		night to the police. We should all 
		forget that night.

				PETE
		What happened to me?

Bill and Claire just stare at Pete.

				PETE (CON'T)
		Please tell me.

				BILL 
		No.

INT. ARNIE'S GARAGE - DAY

Pete is working on a car.  The Mercedes Pullman pulls into 
the shop.  Mr. Eddy gets out with his two assistants.  They 
stay by the car while Mr. Eddy walks over to Pete. Mr. Eddy 
smiles.


				MR. EDDY
		How ya doin', Pete?

				PETE
		Okay.

				MR. EDDY
		I'm sure you noticed that girl that was 
		with me the other day... Good lookin' 
		blonde?  She stayed in the car?...

Pete just stares at Mr. Eddy.  His heart begins to race.

				MR. EDDY (CON'T)
		Her name is Alice.  You know I love that 
		girl to death. If I ever found out 
		somebody was makin' out with her, I'd 
		take this ...
			(he opens his coat and pulls 
			out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk 
			and holds it up in front of 
			Pete's face)
		...and shove it so far up his ass it 
		would come out his mouth... Then you 
		know what?...

				PETE
			(very quietly)
		What?

				MR. EDDY
		I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right
		between the eyes.

Abruptly, Mr. Eddy becomes cool - he holsters his pistol and 
smiles at Pete.

				MR. EDDY (CON'T)
		So, Pete, you're lookin, better.  What
		have you been up to?

CLOSE UP ON PETE'S FACE - staring at Mr. Eddy.

Pete moves into the kitchen and picks up the phone.

				PETE
		Hello.

				ALICE
		Meet me at the Starlight Motel on 
		Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty 
		minutes.

				PETE

		Okay.

Alice hangs up.  Pete stares at the phone for a moment, then 
hangs it up slowly.

Pete pulls his Camaro into the parking lot.  When he gets out

Pete takes a stairway past a "Coke" machine and meets Alice 
in front of a second floor room where the door stands open.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		I already got the room.

Pete follows Alice into the motel room and she shuts the 
door.

				ALICE
		He'll kill us.

				PETE
		Are you positive he knows?

				ALICE
		I'm not positive... but... he knows.

				PETE
		So what do we do?

				ALICE
		I don't know.

				PETE
		We should stop seeing each other.

				ALICE
		No... no.

Alice moves closer to Pete and melts into him.  She places 
his hand on her breast and looks in his eyes.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		I don't want to live without you.

She kisses Pete and pulls up her sweater to let him feel her 
bare breasts.  Pete kisses her back - lost in his longing for 
her.

Alice breaks away.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		We have to get away... We have to get
		some money.

Pete just stares at her.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		I know a guy... He pays girls to party
		with him... He always has alotta cash...

Alice puts her band up to Pete's cbeek and lets it drift 
around.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		He'd be easy to rob... Then we'd have the 
		money... and we could get away ... We'd be 
		together.

Alice kisses Pete's lips over and over - looking in his eyes.

				PETE
		Have you partied with him?

				ALICE
		I used to.

Inside, Pete goes crazy with jealousy.

				PETE
		You like it?

				ALICE
		No, honey... It was part of the deal.

				PETE
		What deal?

				ALICE
		He works for Mr. Eddy.

				PETE
		What's he do?

		He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

		It was a long time ago... I met someone

				PETE
		In pornos?

				ALICE
		No... A job... I didn't know what.  He 
		set up an appointment for me to see a

								CUT TO:

ALICE'S STORY

We see Alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room. It 
feels like we are inside of a large building - maybe an 
office building.

Alice is waiting nervously.

A SLICKSTER in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a 
closed door.

There is another door off the room which is open onto a room 
where a MUSCLE MAN in tiny briefs is doing bench presses.

No one is saying anything.

				ALICE
			(voiceover)
		I went to this place... They made me wait 
		forever.  There was some guy guardin' the 
		door... I started gettin' nervous... In 
		another room I could see some guy liftin'
				(MORE)

				ALICE (cont'd)
		weights... Both these guys gave me the
		creeps... They never said anything to
		me... So I just smoked cigarettes and
		waited.

We move in on a nervous EXHALE OF SMOKE to a CLOSE UP of 
Alice waiting.

We see a CLOSE UP of the man guarding the door.

We see a CLOSE SHOT of the man bench pressing a lot of 
weight.

Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the 
closed door.  The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a 
crack.  He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he 
turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through.

Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking.

She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger 
room.  There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning 
comfortably at different points on the walls.  There is only 
one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it.

No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and 
from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of 
the room.  She does, and she instinctively turns to the man 
sitting in the chair.

They all just stare at her silently.  She looks around 
nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's.

Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and 
cocks it against her head.

Alice goes weak in the knees.  Her eyes fill with fear.

The men continue to stare.

Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?".

Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't 
asked for it with words.

Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she 
knows how.

The men just stare without expression.

When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to 
him.  Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making 
herself available for whatever he wants.

Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes.  She reaches her 
hand up to stroke his cheek...

								 CUT TO:

INT. STARLIGHT MOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

Alice's hand reaches up and strokes Pete's cheek.

				PETE
		Why didn't you just leave?

Alice doesn't say anything.  She drops her hand - looks down.

				PETE (CON'T)
		You liked it.

				ALICE
		If you want me to go away, I'll go away.

The feelings shift inside Pete.  Alice looks in his eyes.

				PETE
		I don't want you to go away.

Alice smiles a little - leans in and they kiss.

				ALICE
			(whispers)
		I love you, Pete.

They kiss some more.

				PETE
			(desperate whisper)
		I love you, Alice.

They start to make love - undressing each other and kissing 
all the while.  Alice stops.

				ALICE
		So, should I call Andy?

				PETE
		Andy?

				ALICE
		That's his name...Andy.  Our ticket out
		of here.

				PETE
		Yeah.  Call him.

Alice gets serious.

				ALICE
		I'll set it up for tomorrow night.  
		You'll meet me at his place at eleven 
		o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a 
		bus ... Make sure no one follows you...
		His address is easy to remember... It's 
		2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white 
		stucco job on the south side of the 
		street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... 
		The back door will be open... That leads 
		into the kitchen - go through the kitchen 
		to the living room - there's a bar 
		there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy 
		to fix me a drink... When he does, you 
		can crack him in the head... Okay?

				PETE
		Okay...

				ALICE
		Lemme call him now.  Make sure he's not
		already busy tomorrow night.

				PETE
		Okay.

Still entwined with each other, Alice reaches for the phone
and dials a number. It starts to ring and she smiles at Pete
when she hears it being answered.

				ALICE
		Andy?... It's me, Alice.  How ya doin?...
			(whispers)
		Andy... I can get away tomorrow night...
		I could come to your house... That sounds
		good... Around nine... Yeah, me too,
		Andy... Great... See ya then.

She hangs up the phone.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		Set.

				PETE
		Why are ya goin' so early?

				ALICE
		'Cause that's how long it's gonna take,
		baby.

				PETE
		What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?

				ALICE
		Are you kidding?... I've got so much on
		Andy, it isn't funny.

				PETE
		What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do
		about Mr. Eddy tonight?

				ALICE
		I'm not goin' home tonight ... I'm goin'
		somewhere else..
			(off his look)
		To a girlfriend's house.
			(she smiles)
		But, we still have a coupla things to
		take care of...

				PETE
		Oh, yeah?... What else?

Alice reaches down between their legs.  Pete smiles.

				ALICE
		This... and this.

They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly -
then wildly.  Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		Are you my man?

				PETE
			(getting hotter)
		Yes.

				ALICE
		Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?

Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		Are you?

Pete stares at her - then nods.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT

Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.  When he 
gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front 
step.  She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to 
see him.  She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she 
YELLS.

				SHEILA
			(total horror)
		THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!!

As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her 
eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then 
the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this 
time.  Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step.

				PETE
			(frightened)
		Sheila?

She heads toward him.

				PETE
		Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin'
		here?

				SHEILA
		You've been fucking somebody else haven't
		you?

				PETE
		Sheila...

				SHEILA
		You fuck me whenever you want... You
		don't call... Tell me who she is.

Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his 
shirt.

				PETE
		Hey... Sheila.

				SHEILA
		What's the BITCH'S name?!

				PETE
		Look Sheila... I'm sorry...

				SHEILA
		YOU'RE SORRY!!

				PETE
		Go home, Sheila.

Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest.

				SHEILA
		YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
		YOU'RE SORRY!!

She starts crying and hitting him harder.

				SHEILA (CON'T)
		FUCK YOU!!

Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood.  
INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER.

Bill comes out of the house.  Claire is behind him waiting on 
the front porch.

Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.  She is 
sobbing as she tears at him.

				PETE
		Sheila... Stop...

				SHEILA
		FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!

Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the 
shoulders.

Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill.

				BILL
		Why don't you two come inside and talk 
		things over quietly... Come on... Come on 
		in, Sheila.

Sheila gets to her feet - crying.  She looks down at Pete, 
who remains lying on the front lawn.

For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED.  
The DRONING SOUND returns.

				SHEILA
			(to Pete)
		You are different.

				BILL
		Sheila... 

				SHEILA
			(to Bill)
		TELL HIM!

The phone inside the house starts to ring.  Claire turns in 
the doorway and goes to answer it.

				BILL
		Sheila... Don't.

				SHEILA
		I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. 
		Dayton... I won't bother you or any 
		member of your family again.

Sheila runs off crying.  Pete and Bill watch her go.

Claire comes to the door.

				CLAIRE
		Pete... There's a man on the phone.  He's
		called a couple of times tonight.

Pete pulls himself up.

				PETE
		Who is it?

				CLAIRE
		He won't give his name.

Pete walks slowly inside - stares at the phone and picks it 
up.

				PETE
		Hello.

				MR. EDDY
			(phone voice)
		Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?

				PETE
		Who is this?

				MR. EDDY
		You know who it is.

Bill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching 
Pete.  Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his 
parents staring at him on the other.  He waves his parents 
away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.

				PETE
		Mr. Eddy?

				MR. EDDY
		Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?

				PETE
		Okay.

				MR. EDDY
		You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.

				PETE
		Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...

				MR. EDDY
		I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.

Pete doesn't know what to say.

				MR. EDDY
		You sure you're doin' okay? Everything
		all right?

				PETE
		Yeah.

				MR. EDDY
		That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to
		talk to a friend of mine.

Pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone.  There 
is a long silence.  Pete can hear breathing.

				VOICE
		We've met before, haven't we?

Pete freezes.  His mind is scrambling.

				PETE
		I don't think so.  Where was it that you
		think we've met?

				VOICE
		At your house.  Don't you remember?

				PETE
		No. No, I don't.

				VOICE
		We just killed a couple of people...

				PETE
		What?

Pete can hear Mr. Eddy laugh in the background.

				VOICE
		You heard me... We thought we'd come over
		and tell you about it.

Pete is getting pale with fear.

				PETE
		What's goin' on?

				VOICE
		Great question!! In the east ... the far 
		east... when a person is sentenced to 
		death... they're sent to a place where 
		they can't escape... never knowing when 
		an executioner will step up behind them 
		and fire a bullet into the back of their 
		head... it could be days... weeks... or 
		even years after the death sentence has 
		been pronounced... This uncertainty adds 
		an exquisite element of torture to the 
		situation, don't you think?  It's been a 
		pleasure talking to you.

Pete can hear the phone being passed again.

				MR. EDDY
		Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell
		you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.

The phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his 
fate.  He hears a NOISE and turns.

Down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring 
at him.

CLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living 
room as if sensing something, but not seeing.

PARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond.  There is no 
one there.

A City Bus pulls up to the stop.  The doors open and Pete

The bus stops and Pete gets out.  He starts walking.

								     CUT TO:

EXT. DEEP DELL PLACE - NIGHT

We see a street sign saying "Deep Dell Place".  Pete walks up 
the street looking at numbers.

He finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.

He stares at the house from the sidewalk.

Lights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big 
shadows of trees over the front of the house.

Pete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m.

He walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and 
comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.

He stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the 
fence, but crashes on something on the other side.

He freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through 
the trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece.  
He hears echoing sounds of love making.

He makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries 
the back door.  It opens.

								     CUT TO:
INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living 
room.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is 
running in the living room.  A porno film is being projected 
on a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film.  
A man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS 
of flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her 
eyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute 
of it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control.  
He looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks 
up a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs.

Feet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down.

Pete runs for the bar.

Along the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well-
stacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, 
and ducks behind the bar.

He can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two 
glasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno 
film.  He clenches his teeth with rage.

Suddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each 
other.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the 
bronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls.  
The breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his 
forehead.

Pete turns.

Alice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for 
a pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth.  
She is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is 
playing on the wall 
behind her.

These images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves 
unsteadily toward her.

				ALICE
		You got him.

				PETE
			(still holding the figurine)
		Alice, I...

Pete starts to tremble.  He drops the figurine.  He tries to 
embrace her.

There is a crashing noise behind him.

Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the 
wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE.

Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down.  When Pete hits the 
ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms.  This, and 
Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the 
rectangular glass-topped coffee table.  There is a sound like a
hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner 
embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead.

CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the 
table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach 
touching the floor.

				ALICE
			(amazement - no feeling)
		Wow!

Pete pulls himself off the floor.

Pete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee 
table, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body.

While Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly 
picks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it 
lay Andy's trousers.  She goes through the pockets, finds a 
roll of cash bound by a rubber band.  Alice hands the roll to 
Pete.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		Put this in your pocket.

Alice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his 
Rolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain 
dangling from his neck.  These items she puts inside the 
empty pillowcase.

Alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the 
living room and puts them on.  Pete watches her, trembling, 
unable to say anything.

She comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, 
hyperventilating.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		You all right?

				PETE,
		We killed him.

				ALICE
		You killed him.

				PETE
		Alice?

Alice slides up close to Pete.

				ALICE
		It was an accident... Accidents happen
		every day.

Pete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding 
on for dear life.

				PETE
		Alice...

				ALICE
			(pushing back)
		We gotta get the stuff and get out of
		here.

Alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase.

Pete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur.  He looks 
around the room, which spins in and out of focus.  His eyes 
land on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall.  This photo 
troubles him.  Pete squints, then points to the photograph.

				PETE
		Is that you?  Are both of them you?

CLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame: 
Andy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy.

Alice stops and comes back.  She looks at the photo, walks 
closer to it, and points at herself.

				ALICE
		That's me.

She turns to Pete.  Pete is staring at the photograph - at 
Alice and Renee in the photograph.  His nose is bleeding
profusely.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		Pete?...

Pete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt.

				PETE
		Where's the bathroom?

				ALICE
		Up the stairs - down the hall.

Pete runs up the stairs	- about to get sicker. Alice watches
him go with a nuance of	disdain.

								      CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

Pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the 
hallway.  THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND 
LONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE.

Pete wanders down this "changed" hall.  On his left, he 
identifies a door with the number 25 on it.  He pauses for a 
moment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he 
comes to a door with the number 26 on it.  He enters through 
this door.

Inside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN.  Her arms 
are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her 
from behind.  The man's face is blank, featureless, and is 
buried in the woman's back - we can't see it.

Pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version 
of Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror.  
He's looking at her reflection in the mirror.  Pete's head is 
pounding.

				WOMAN/ALICE
			(to Pete)
		Did you want to talk to me?

Pete rubs his head - the pain is severe.

				WOMAN/ALICE
				(CON'T)
			(laughs)
		Did you want to ask me "why"?

Pete staggers out of the room.

He closes the door.  The hallway has "changed" back to Andy's 
hallway.  The doors no longer have numbers.

Pete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering.  He 
starts down the stairs.

								      CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at 
the desk in the corner, filling the pillowcase with cash and 
jewelry.

She has a PISTOL in her hand.

Alice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's 
face as Pete makes his way to her.  His head is still 
throbbing with pain.  His focus goes from her face to the gun 
- which is pointing right at him - back to her.  Alice 
smiles.

				ALICE
		Don't you trust me, Pete?...

She laughs and hands him the pistol.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		Stick that in your belt.

She shows him the pillowcase filled with loot.

				ALICE (CON'T)
			(going through the loot)
		Look at all this shit... I know a 
		fence... he'll give us money and get us 
		passports in exchange for this and the 
		car...
			(looks up at him)
		We can go anywhere.

				PETE
		Alice?

Alice grabs Pete's arm and hurries him toward the door.

				ALICE
		Come on, baby.

								     CUT TO:

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Alice takes Pete to Andy's car and throws him the keys.

				ALICE
		You drive.

Alice jumps in Andy's car and tosses the bulging pillowcase 
in the back.  Pete takes the revolver out of his belt.  He 
opens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits 
inside.  He sets the pistol on the seat between them.  He 
looks up at her.  She smiles wildly.  Pete slalms the door -
starts the car and they drive off.

								     CUT TO:

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - EDGE OF THE DESERT - NIGHT

Alice and Pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the 
end of a street at the edge of a desert.  Alice gets out into 
a hot wind.  Pete stays in the car as she goes up to the 
house.

Pete's POV: He watches Alice ring the doorbell.  She waits 
in front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in 
the wind.

A HOUSEBOY opens the door.  Alice says something to him -
Pete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his 
driver's side window is down.  All he can hear is the hot 
wind blowing.

The Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in 
the car.  The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.  The 
Houseboy points out toward the desert.  Alice turns back to 
the car. The Houseboy watches her.

								      CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S CAR - NIGHT 

Alice gets into the car.

				ALICE
		Come on.

Pete starts the car and begins backing it out the drive.  The 
Houseboy is still standing - watching them.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		We have to go to the desert.  He's at his
		cabin.

Pete and Alice drive off.  The Houseboy continues to watch 
them.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT - TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

We see the clean moving POV illuminated by headlights.  We're 
floating down an old two-lane highway through a desolate, 
desert landscape.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

Pete and Alice pull off the two-lane highway onto a barely 
discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

Pete and Alice drive up to a ONE ROOM CABIN built on stilts 
next to a dry lakebed.  They both get out and go up the 
stairs to a porch where Alice knocks on the door.  There is 
no answer.

Alice opens the door, but there is NOBODY INSIDE.

				ALICE
		We'll have to wait.

The hot wind continues to blow.

Alice and Pete walk back down to the car.

The HEADLIGHTS are on and Alice reaches in through the window 
and switches on the RADIO.  She can't get anything in but 
static, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out.  
She hits the "seek" button.  The radio starts to search.

Pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her.  
Alice walks slowly to him.

The camera captures this from a back seat perspective - then 
drifts toward them.

				PETE
		Why me, Alice?  Why choose me?

The radio sticks on a particular tune - a tune filled with
longing. Alice begins to dance.  She takes Pete's hand and
pulls him close to her.

				ALICE
		So we can be together... You still want
		to be with me, don't you Pete?

Alice gives Pete that wild smile.

				ALICE (CON'T)
		More than ever?

She kisses Pete over and over.  He begins to kiss her back.  
She starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare 
of the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.

The scene is out of a dream.  Alice and Pete help each other 
undress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind 
whips at their bodies.

They sink down on the soft ground and start making love.

The lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, 
bathing them in a pristine glow.

The music fades and the radio begins to "seek" through static 
for another station.  The music it finds now is LOUD and 
INTENSE.

Alice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her 
approach to love making with Pete.  She is the aggressor, 
highly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not 
giving, insatiable.

The headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.  They 
become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.

Pete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.

The driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.  The 
radio strains to hold the station.

Pete's white-hot body clings to Alice.  He chokes with 
emotion.

				PETE
		I want you... I want you...

With a burning smile, Alice rolls them out of the beams of 
light into the darkness.  The wind billows a black cloud of 
dust around them.

Alice pulls away from Pete and brings her dark mouth to his 
ear.

				ALICE
		You'll never have me.

Alice glides away from Pete and stands up looking down at him 
from above.

She turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears 
within it.

Pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness.  He's 
holding his head and shaking.

As he starts to stand - he turns into the glare of the
headlights and we see that it is NOT PETE - BUT FRED.

As Fred stands up, the car's LIGHTS DIM and the RADIO FADES.

Fred looks at the car.  He sees some movement inside.  Fred 
looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat.

CLOSE UP OF THE MAN - it's the Mystery Man from Andy's party.

				VOICE FROM BEHIND
				FRED
		Hello.

Fred turns toward the cabin and sees the Mystery Man now 
standing in the doorway.

Fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty.  He 
looks back at the cabin and sees the Mystery Man still in the 
doorway.

				MYSTERY MAN
		Here I am.

Fred is dizzy with fear and confusion.

He pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to 
the cabin toward the Mystery Man, who goes inside.  Fred 
stops in the doorway.  He looks around.

				FRED
		Where's Alice?

				MYSTERY MAN
		Alice who?

Fred looks around again but there is no one there except the 
Mystery Man - standing in the center of the room.  Fred 
stares at him.

				MYSTERY MAN
				(CON'T)
		Her name is Renee.  If she's told you her
		name is Alice, she's lying.
			(filled now with anger)
		AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR
		NAME?!

Fred freaks, scared to death. He bolts down the stairs to 
the car, stumbling more than once. 

Fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical 
charge by the use of the headlights and radio.

The Mystery Man appears in the doorway of the cabin.  He 
starts toward Fred.

The starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically.

The smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car,

The engine catches.  Fred revs it - throws the car in reverse 
and peels out away from the Mystery Man, whose hand is
reaching for him.

Fred swerves the car around - throws it in drive, and takes 
off across the dark desert.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Fred pulls up onto the two-lane highway.  An old, rusted 
roadsign is posted there.  It reads: "LOST HIGHWAY".

								      CUT TO:

Fred is driving along the two-lane desert "lost highway".  
The wind is picking up even stronger than before.  A big 
storm is blowing in.

Fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: LOST HIGHWAY 
HOTEL.  The sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it.

Fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it.

He gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under 
his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two-story 
building.

								     CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - OFFICE - NIGHT

Fred walks up to the registration desk, where a CLERK is 
smiling at him in a half-baked way.

				CLERK
		You just got in before the big storm
		hits.

Fred pulls the roll of bills from his pocket.

				FRED
		I need a room.

								     CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

The hallway is strangely similar to Pete's vision upstairs at 
Andy's.  Fred comes to the door numbered 25, looks at his key 
which says "25" and unlocks the door and enters.

								     CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - NIGHT

Fred takes the revolver out of his shirt and puts it under 
the pillow on the bed.

He sits on the edge of the bed.  He takes a cigarette from a 
pack in his shirt pocket and lights it with a match from a 
book of "Lost Highway Hotel" matches.

Fred smokes the cigarette, listening to the wind blow.  
Lightning cracks outside the window.

Fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside 
table.  As the last of the blue smoke drifts away, Fred falls 
back on the bed.

Fred closes his eyes.

								    FADE OUT:

								     FADE IN:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The camera moves in on the door numbered 26.

								      CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - NIGHT

Renee is in bed with Mr. Eddy/Laurent.  He and Renee are 
feverishly making love as the storm rages outside.

								 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A criminal investigation is under way.  Ed and Al are 
present, among a fleet of LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL who are 
busy dusting for fingerprints and examining the murder site.

				ED
		Hey, Al, look at this.

Al walks over to where Ed is looking at the photo on the 
wall.  Al looks at it.

				AL
		It's her, all right.  Fred Madison's 
		wife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent-
		head over there.

CLOSE UP ON THE PHOTOGRAPH - that shows RENEE AS THE ONLY 
WOMAN IN THE PICTURE, standing between Andy and Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent.

				AL
		We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over
		this place.

				ED
		You know what I think?

				AL
		What's that, Ed?

				ED
		There's no such thing as a bad
		coincidence.

								     CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN

Renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed, pulling 
on her stockings.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her.  
Renee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and 
kisses her lover while he sleeps.  Renee leaves the room, 
closing the door as quietly as possible behind her.

As the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up 
and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes 
one out, lights it with a book of "Lost Highway Hotel" 
matches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.

								     CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN

Fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE -
the same attitude he had on the videotape.  He strains 
upwards and looks eerily around the room.  He gets up and 
crosses slowly to a window.  He takes the edge of the window 
curtain and pulls it back.

The view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel.

Fred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, 
get in and drive away.

Fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under 
the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.

								    CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - CORRIDOR - PRE-DAWN

Fred crosses over to Room 26 and knocks softly on the door.

								    CUT TO:

INT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 26 - PRE-DAWN

Mr. Eddy/Laurent is standing - almost dressed, when he hears 
the knock.

				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
		Renee?

He goes to the door and opens it a crack.

As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room.

Fred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun 
barrel.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his 
forehead and nose.

				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
		What the fuck? What's going on?

				FRED
			(pointing the gun at him)
		You're coming with me.

Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and 
marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye.

The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the 
window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear 
down below in the back lot.

Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. 
Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into 
the trunk of a car.  Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into 
the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car 
- the Mercedes 600 Pullman.

As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. 
The hand moves the window curtain further to one side.  The 
camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery 
Man.  The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches 
Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAYBREAK

Fred is driving along the road.  Suddenly he pulls the car 
off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted 
spot, stops and gets out.

Fred opens the trunk. When he does ...

Suddenly, Mr. Eddy/Laurent charges up and attacks Fred -
knocking them both to the ground.  Mr. Eddy/Laurent tries to 
strangle Fred, but Fred's anger is too great.  Fred tears 
loose and gets Mr. Eddy/Laurent in a hold bending his head 
back.  Fred's hand reaches out behind him - feeling, 
searching.

A KNIFE appears.

it comes into Fred's hand from another.

Fred slices Mr. Eddy/Laurent's throat, and throws him down.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent squirms on the ground - his hand grasped 
around his throat - trying to hold his neck together.  Blood 
is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of 
him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.

Fred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right 
at Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.

CLOSE UP ON MR. EDDY/LAURENT - he lifts his head and stares 
at Fred.  Blood is rushing out of him.

				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
			(wet and jagged)
		What do you guys want?

The camera pans around to Fred - we see that the Mystery Man 
is standing beside Fred, and it is the Mystery Man who is 
holding the gun, not Fred.

The Mystery Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a 
little watchman TV.  He turns it on and hands it over to Mr. 
Eddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move 
in until the screen fills the frame - as with the former 
videotapes.  The full frame of the TV screen reveals -

INT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We see the movie screen on a wall in Andy's living room.  
Marian, Raquel and RENEE'S images are being projected on this 
screen, simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two 
men. Watching this movie in Andy's living room are several 
people in shadows behind the light of the projector.  Among 
them we see RENEE and MR. EDDY/LAURENT standing next to ANDY.
Mr. Eddy/Laurent and Renee are hot - kissing - his hand is up 
under her skirt.  They are watching the porno film.  They are 
watching murky images of sex turning to violence.

In a CLOSE UP we see Renee and Mr. Eddy/Laurent in the 
shadows looking out at the film, both half-smiling, stoned, 
aroused.

The image on the Watchman changes now.

EXT. DESERT - DAYBREAK

On the Watchman TV screen Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees an image of 
Fred and the Mystery Man staring at him.  The Mystery Man's 
image speaks.

				MYSTERY MAN
			(on TV screen)
		Now you can hand it back to me.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent sees the Mystery Man's image reach out a 
hand.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent looks up.  The Mystery Man has his arm 
outstretched just as it was on the video image.  Mr. Eddy/ 
Laurent hands the Watchman back, and locks eyes with the 
Mystery Man.

				MR. EDDY/LAURENT
			(wet and jagged)
		You and me, mister, we can really out-
		ugly the sumbitches, can't we?

The mystery Man unloads the pistol into Mr. Eddy/Laurent, who 
jerks and dies in the dust.

The Mystery Man then leans close to Fred and whispers in his 
ear.

The camera moves in, past the Mystery Man to a CLOSE UP OF 
FRED'S EYES as he listens.

The camera cuts back wide to reveal Fred holding the gun.  He 
is standing alone - there is no Mystery Man.  Fred turns to 
go back to the car.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING

Fred drives up to his house in Mr. Eddy/Laurent's Mercedes 
600 Pullman and stops in front.  He gets out of the car, goes 
to the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL.  There is a BEEP sound.

				FRED
			(into intercom)
		Dick Laurent is dead.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - STREET - EARLY MORNING

As Fred finishes this sentence we see the cop car containing 
Ed and Al pull in to the curb just up the street from Fred 
and Renee's house.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. THE MADISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING

Fred turns and sees the cop car.  He jumps in his car, fires 
it up, and peels out.  The cops give chase.

								      CUT TO:

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

Fred is behind the wheel of his car.  Behind him are the 
cops.

CLOSE UP ON FRED'S FACE - through the front windshield.  The 
shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit.

Fred's face begins to change again, grotesquely contorting as 
he races into the vortex.  His tormented SCREAM blends with 
the howling SIREN of the police car gaining on him.

EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY


The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men
imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK
CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.
His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white
sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late
thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-
let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from
a glass of iced tea. Then:

                          CRAWFORD
           I should have caught you at the boat
           yard when you got off work. You
           don't want to talk about it here...

                          GRAHAM
           I don't want to talk about it
           anywhere.
                   (beat)
           If you brought pictures, leave them
           in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin
           will be back soon.

                          CRAWFORD
           How much do you know?

                          GRAHAM
           What was in the 'Miami Herald' and
           the 'Times.'
                   (beat)
           Confessions?

                          CRAWFORD
           Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He
           smashes the mirrors and uses the
           pieces.
                   (beat)
           None of them knew that;

                          GRAHAM
           What else did you keep out of the
           papers?

                          CRAWFORD
           Blond, right-handed, really strong,
           wears a size eleven shoe. The prints
           are all smooth gloves. He's on a
           full moon cycle. Both times. His
           blood is AB Positive.

                          GRAHAM
           Somebody hurt him?

                          CRAWFORD
           Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.

Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham.

2.
Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.
                           CRAWFORD
           Will... you saw this in the papers.
           The second one was all over TV. Did
           you ever think about givin' me a
           call?

                          GRAHAM
           No.

                           CRAWFORD
           Why not?

                           GRAHAM
           The Bureau already has the best lab.
           Plus you have Bloom at the University
           of Chicago...

                           CRAWFORD
           And I got you down here fixing fuckin'
           boat motors.

                           GRAHAM
           You don't need me. I wouldn't
           be useful to you anymore, Jack.

                           CRAWFORD
           Last two like this we had, you
           caught.

                           GRAHAM
           That was three years ago. And by
           doing the same things you and the
           rest of them at the lab are doing.

                           CRAWFORD
           That's not entirely true, Will.
           It's the way you think.


                           GRAHAM
           I think there has been a lot of
           bullshit about the way I think.
                   (beat)
           I came down here to get away from
           all that.

                          CRAWFORD
           You look all right now.

                          GRAHAM
           I am all right.

Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps
them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.




3.
                            CRAWFORD
            If you can't look anymore, I
            understand...

                            GRAHAM
            As long as they're dead...

                           CRAWFORD
            These are all dead, Will.


 PICTURES

 If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two
 snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck
 carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family
 behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.


 CLOSE: GRAHAM

 looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he
 puts them down and looks along the beach.


 GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN

 KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the
 water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.
 MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands
 watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen
 around her ankles. Her body language openly states
 hostility. It's towards Crawford.

                           GRAHAM (O.S.)
            Let's talk after dinner. Stay and
            eat.


                            CRAWFORD (O.S.)
            I'LL come back later. I got messages
            at the Holiday Inn to collect

 Molly starts walking forward. On it...

                            MOLLY
            He stopped by to see me at the shop
            before he came out here.

                            GRAHAM
            What did he want?






4.
                                 MOLLY
                 He asked how you are.

                                GRAHAM
                 And you said?

                                 MOLLY
                 I said you are fine, he should leave
                 you the hell alone.

                                 GRAHAM
                 I'm a forensic specialist, Molly.
                 You've seen my diploma?
                          (sarcastic)
                 I got a diploma and everything.

                                 MOLLY
                 You mended a crack in the wallpaper
                 with your diploma.
                          (heat)
                 You are open and easy now... It took
                 you a lot of work to get to that...

                                 GRAHAM
                 We have it good, don't we?

                                 MOLLY
                 All the things that happened to you
                 before make you know that...

      There is a soft pleading in her voice.

                                GRAHAM
                 What the hell can I do?

                                 MOLLY
                          (after a pause)
                 What you've already decided. You're
                 not really asking.

                                GRAHAM
                 If I were?

                                 MOLLY
                          (facing him)
                 Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.
                 And Kevin.
                          (heat)
                 That's selfish, huh?

                 He'll never see me or know my name.
                 If we find him, the police will have
                 to take him down. Not me, I'm just
                 looking at evidence.

On the porch swing. Beyond them at the water's edge Graham
nothing to each other    the fence. Crawford and Molly say

                           MOLLY
           Whatever I say, you'll take him
           away, won't you?

                          CRAWFORD
           I have to.

                           MOLLY
           You're his friend, Jack. Why can't
           you leave him alone?

                           CRAWFORD
           Because it's his bad luck to be
           special.

                           MOLLY
           He thinks you want him to look at
           evidence.

                          CRAWFORD
           Nobody's better with evidence. But
           he has the other thing, too. He
           doesn't like that part of it...

                          MOLLY
           You wouldn't like it, either if you
           had it.

There is a pause between them. Molly lights a cigarette.
Crawford leans forward, resting his thick, pale, forearms
on his knees.

                          CRAWFORD
           Talking about 'like,' you don't like

Small poplars line the curb. It rained. The sidewalks are
wet. They are drying in splotches. The street is deserted.
The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME. An Atlanta
Police department car pulls to the curb and stops. The door
opens, lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the
passenger side.

           Thanks for the lift.

                          OFFICER
           I'll come inside with you, if you
           like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd
           probably want to be alone.

                          GRAHAM
           That's right.

 Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us. We PAN AROUND as
 he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house
 with all of the Atlanta Police department "crime scene" postings
 Graham doesn't enter the front door. Be walks around the side.

 INT. LEEDS HOUSE, KITCHEN - WIDE - NIGHT

 Three big sliding glass doors. The center one has been re-
 placed with plywood. It's dark. A flashlight's beam starts
 playing through the bushes in the side yard.., then the light
 appears and blasts IN the LENS. It lights lots of dishes in
 the sink. The dark kitchen looks like anybody's kitchen. The
 house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been
 undisturbed.


 CLOSE: GLASS DOOR

 We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham
 enters. It's like he's a burglar.


 GRAHAM'S FEET

 walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going.
 A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly.
 Graham's feet pass our of frame...


 INT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR

 is empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps
 up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash-
 light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark
 stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master
 bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing.


 INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH
 Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch.

 BLOOD

 screams at us from the walls.

 CLOSE: GRAHAM

8.
WIDER - GRAHAM
moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half
the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The
mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi-
cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the
file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports.


OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM

standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The
crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial
blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or
bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic.
Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his
own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference.

                           GRAHAM
           intruder entered through kitchen
           sliding door. Probably a glass
           cutter. Why didn't he care that he
           left AB saliva on the glass? it was
           hot out that night. inside, the
           house must' have been pleasantly cool
           to him.
                   (beat)
           The intruder cut Charles Leeds'
           throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs.
           Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was
           rising... Bullet entered the right of
           her navel and lodged in her lumbar
           spine, but she died of strangulation...
           increase of serotonin and free
           histimine levels in the gunshot wound
           indicates... she lived at least five
           minutes after she was shot... All
           her other injuries were post-mortem.
                   (beat>
           Then he went toward the children's
           room.
                   (beat)
           Direction and velocity of blood
           stains on the east wall indicate
           arterial spray.;. With his throat
           cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight.
           Because the intruder was moving to
           the children's room...
                   (beat)
           in the children's room the intruder
           shot the first boy in bed. Second
           boy was found in bed, but dustballs
           indicate he was dragged out from
           under his bed to be shot...

	      ligature mark around Mr. Leed's
           chest, believed to be post-mortem.

He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on
the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the
faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be
is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees...


ZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE

still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham
is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom.
He doesn't let it unnerve him.

EXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT

The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and
sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed
reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond
him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant...
More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid
meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image.
He takes out his tape recorder again.

                         GRAHAM
           There's a wicker dog bed on the back
           porch. There's a doghouse in the

GRAHAM

snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2.


CONVENTIONEER #2

sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles:


                           CONVENTIONEER #1
           What the fuck are you lookin' at?

Graham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens.

ZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT

We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home
movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while
the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next
to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All
are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth-
day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath
her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's
smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds
runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his
wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He
looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to
the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy
blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera
a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A
big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.
11.

The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to
follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise.


GRAHAM

has hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch
of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in
outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial
splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs.
Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat-
tress.

                           GRAHAM
                   (into the tape
                   recorder)
           When they were dead -- except
           possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed
           the mirrors and began selecting
           shards that he used later on Mrs.
           Leeds... What did he do in the
           interval? Struggling with Mr.
           Leeds and killing the others would
           take less than a minute. What
           else?
                   (beat)
           Three bloodstains on the east wall,
           not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray.
           What did killer do after they were
           dead?

Graham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks
up the phone and dials. He waits. Then:

                           GRAHAM
                   (into phone)

           Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will.
           Good night.

Will hangs up the phone. He reaches over and punches "Play"
on the VTR.


12.

WIDE SHOT: THE ROOM - GRAHAM
VTR backs up, starts to play and we see the image of Mrs.
Leeds again in the home movie: they follow the yellow rib-
bon down the stairs to a bicycle. It's indoors. It's rain-
ing outside. The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic.
Mrs. Leeds smiles.

                           GRAHAM
                   (into tape recorder)
           You moved the kids after you killed
           them, didn't you? Did you arrange
           them for your performance with Mrs.
           Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr.
           Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the
           postmortem ligature on his chest.
           Did you make them your audience?
           Did you open their eyes? There is
           something you can't afford for me
           to know about. Isn't there? Mrs.
           Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was
           maddening to have to wear gloves when
           you touched her, wasn't it?
                   (beat)
           There was talcum powder on her leg.
           There was no talcum powder in the
           bathroom.
                   (beat)
           The powder they found came out of a
           rubber glove as you pulled it off

           to touch her. You took off your
           glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU,
           YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH?! You touched
           her with your bare hands! And then
           you put the gloves back an. And
           you wiped her down! While your
           gloves were off?
                   (shouts)
           DID YOU OPEN THEIR EYES? THEIR DEAD
           EYES?!


FAST MOVEMENTS: GRAHAM'S HAND

He is cold, calm.

            You said the guy down here is good.

                            GRAHAM
            He is good. Bur not as good as Price.

            What do you want to do?


                            GRAHAM
            Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails.

                            SPRINGFIELD
            Our people swear he wore surgeons'
            gloves the whole time. They dusted
            everything.

                            GRAHAM
            The report didn't mention nails and
            eyes.

                            SPRINGFIELD
            Why do you think he took his gloves
            off?

                            GRAHAM
            Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman.
            I'd want to touch her skin in an
            intimate situation, wouldn't you?

                            SPRINGFIELD
                   (sudden distaste)
            'Intimate? !"

                            GRAHAM
            Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.
                   (beat)
            Everybody else was dead.
14.

Springfield looks at Graham. Springfield needs answers, not
voodoo. Then they enter the squad room. Twenty detectives
sit at desks. Graham and Crawford move to the back of the
class.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           All right. House to house interviews
           will be extended four additional
           blocks. R & I has loaned us two
           clerks to help cross-matching airline
           reservations between Birmingham last
           month and between Atlanta now.
                   (beat)
           Dr. Princi.

DR. DOMINIQUE PRINCI, Chief Medical Examiner for Fulton
County, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of
teeth. He hold's up a dental cast.

                           DR. PRINCI
           This is what the subject's teeth
           look like. The Smithsonian in
           Washington reconstructed them from
           the impressions we took of bite
           marks off the Leeds woman here and
           off the Jacobi woman last month in
           Birmingham.
                   (beat)
	     As you can see, he has pegged lateral
           incisors -- the teeth here and here.

The teeth look like teeth from a small bear.

                          SPRINGFIELD
           Investigator Graham has worked this
           kind of thing before. Can you add
           anything?

Graham doesn't like talking in public. He stutters and
starts to say something...

                           SPRINGFIELD
           Can't hear you. Can you come up to
           the front?

Graham walks to the front of the room.

                           GRAHAM
           He may have a history of biting --
           barroom fights or child abuse.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           He only bit women so far, right?

                          GRAHAM
           That's all we know about.

                          GRAHAM (CONT'D)
                   (beat)
          Most of the time in sex assaults the
          bite mark has a livid spot in the
          center. A suck mark. These don't.
          So, for him, biting may be a fighting
          pattern as much as sexual behavior.
                   (beat)
          You could try emergency room
          personnel, treatment for bite wounds.
          I know that's pretty thin...
                   (beat)
          He bites a lot.

                          SPRINGFIELD
          What's average?

                          GRAHAM
          Sex murder: three. He likes to
          bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.

          Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...
                   (beat)
          ... that's all I have.

Graham sits down.

                          SPRINGFIELD
          All right. Vice and Narcotics, take
          the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.
          Marcus and Whitman heads up at the
          funeral. The rest of you, your
          assignments are on the sheet. Let's
          go.

They start to rise. Springfield remembers.

                          SPRINGFIELD
          One more thing: I've heard officers
          referring to the killer as the 'Tooth
          Fairy.
                   (on laughter)
          Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear
          that in public or internal memoranda.
          That's it.

Detectives file out. Crawford and Graham remain.
Springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other
detectives to leave.

                          SPRINGFIELD
                   (to Crawford)
          We don't have shit, and we know it.

Dr. Princi joins them.


16.

                           SPRINGFIELD
                   (to Graham)
           The Commissioner was saying you
           were the one that caught Dr. Lecter
           three years ago.
                   (beat)
           He killed nine people, didn't he?

                           GRAHAM
           Nine that we know of. Two didn't
           die.

                          SPRINGFIELD
           What happened to them?

                           GRAHAM
           One's on the respirator at a hospital
           in Baltimore. The other is in a
           private mental hospital in Denver.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           What did the psychologists say was
           wrong with Lecter?

                          GRAHAM
           Psychologists call him a sociopath.
           They don't know what else to call
           him.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           What would you call him?

Graham doesn't answer.

                          SPRINGFIELD
           To yourself...

                          GRAHAM
           I call him a monster.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           I understand he cut you pretty good...

                           GRAHAM
                   (cold right turn>
           What about the dog?

                           SPRINGFIELD
           It's at the vet's. The kids brought
           it in with a puncture wound in the
           abdomen. icepick or an awl.

                           GRAHAM
           Was the dog wearing a collar with
           the Leeds' name on it?

                          SPRINGFIELD
           No.
17.


                          GRAHAM
          Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have
          a dog?

                          CRAWFORD
                   (alert)
          A cat. We found a litter box
          downstairs but not the cat.
          Neighbors are watching for it.

                          GRAHAM
          Why don't you get Birmingham P.D.
          a methane probe out of D.C. and
          have them cover the backyard...
          maybe the cat's dead and the kids
          buried it.

Crawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield
answers.
                          SPRINGFIELD
          Yeah?
                   (waits)
Lemme put you on the speaker phone.

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          Who am I talking to?

                          CRAWIIORD
          Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and
          you got Will Graham here.

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          I got a partial with a tented arch
          that's probably a thumb print and
          a fragment of a palm.

Springfield reacts.

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          Came off the oldest kid's left eye.
          It stood out against an eight-ball
          hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.

                          CRAWFORD
          Can you make an identification off
          it?

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          Don't know. The palm came off the
          nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
          I want to work these up in my own
          darkroom. I'll fax the prints down
          to you this afternoon.
Hangs up.



18.
SPRINGFIELD
thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very
changed.


GRAHAM

senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank.
He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches
Graham all the way to the door.

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY

coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield,
the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No-
body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who
separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is
LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them.

                           LOUNDS
           Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie
           Lounds? I covered the Lecter
           case for the Tattler. I did the
           paperback... !


CLOSE: GRAHAM

walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel
trap. He's repressing something powerful.

                           LOUNDS
                   (running on, behind
                   them)
           When did they call you in, Will?
           What have you got?

Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now.

                          CRAWFORD
           Lounds, give it a rest...

                           LOUNDS
           Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!

Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford
tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:

                           LOUNDS
           How does this guy compare with
           Lecter? How does he do them?

Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to
turn him around.


19.

 GRAHAM

 Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under
 him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The
 impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The
 violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from
 Lounds.


                            GRAHAM
                    (very low)
            Keep the fuck away from me!

 Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham
 lets go.


 WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY

 down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and
 lands on all fours.

                            CRAWFORD
                    (over his shoulder
                    to Lounds)
            Get the hell away from here, Lounds!
                                                 CUT TO:
 INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY
 Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee.
 Crawford is looking at him. Finally:

                            GRAHAM
            ...snuck in the hospital while I
            was sedated, flipped back the sheets
            and shot pictures. The only decent
            thing he did was run a black square
            over my balls...

                           CRAWFORD
            I know...

 Graham looks away. Then he lights another cigarette.

                            GRAHAM
                    (back to business)
            Atlanta and Birmingham can run
            the thumb print against known sex
            offenders. Five will get you
            ten they don't come up with an
            identification. Jimmie may in the
            Finder program... if he's ever been
            printed and in his Index.






20.

               		CRAWFORD
Say we've arrested a good suspect.
You walk in and see him. What
is there about him that doesn't
surprise you?

               GRAHAM
I don't know, Jack. He's got no
face for me.

               CRAWFORD
You can tell something about him
or we wouldn't have found the finger
print. ..

               GRAHAM.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack,
all right?
        (pause)
We'll get him one way or the other.

               CRAWFORD
What's one way?

               GRAHAM
We find an event that connects both
families. Same vacation hotel; same
hospital, different times. Then we
check employees and come up with a
male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...
        (beat)
If we find out how he found them,
then we'll find him.

		  CRAWFORD
We're running it through the
computers now. So far there's no
event or service that doubles back
into both families. Plus they were
big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing
trips, scuba, videogames, lots of
routine medical and dental. It's
a haystack.
        (beat)
What's the other?

               GRAHAM
He makes noise going in and the
husband gets to a gun in time.

               CRAWFORD
No other possibilities?

               GRAHAM
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across
a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza
you're thinking about.

                (beat)
         The Tooth Fairy will go on until we
         get smart or get lucky. He won't
         stop.

                     CRAWFORD
         Why?

                      GRAHAM
         Because he has a genuine taste for
         it, Jack.

                      CRAWFORD
         See? You do know something about
         him.

                      GRAHAM
                (long stare at
                Crawford; then)
         ... I'm going to see Lecter.

Crawford's cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth:

                     CRAWFORD
         For Christ's sake, why?

                      GRAHAM
               (matter-of-fact)
         To recover the mind set.

                                       CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM - DAY

In the middle of packing. Then the PHONE RINGS.

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
         Hello, hotshot!

                     GRAHAM
         Hey, baby! Where are you?

                      MOLLY (V.O.)
         At the store. You doin' some good?

                      GRAHAM
         None you'd notice. I'm lonely...

                     MOLLY (V,O.)
         Me, too. And very erotic...

                     GRAHAM
         Tell me about yourself.

                      MOLLY (V.O.)
         Which part? That or the day-to-day.

22.
                     GRAHAM
               (laughs)
        Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.
              (beat)
        How's Kevin?

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
        Kevin's fine. He had to recover the
        turtle eggs you two fenced in. The
        dogs dug them up. Tell me what
        you're doing.

                     GRAHAM
        Eating junk food.
               (beat)
        They don't have a lock on anything,
        Molly. There's not enough
        information. Or I haven't done
        enough with it...

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
        Will you be in Atlanta for a while?
        I'm not buggin' you about coming
        home, I just wondered.

                     GRAHAM
        Z don't know. I'm goin' up to
        Baltimore this afternoon.

                    MOLLY (V.O.)
        To do what?

                    GRAHAM
        I have to see somebody.

There is a silence. Graham does not want to tell her that
he is going to see Lecter. Molly stays cool, she doesn't

pursue it.

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
        I'm thinking about painting the
        kitchen. What color do you like,
        Will? Are you there?

                     GRAHAM
               (coming back)
        Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it
        yellow.

                    MOLLY (V.O.)
        Yellow's a bad color for me. I'LL
        look green at breakfast.

                    GRAHAM
        Blue, then.

                    MOLLY (V.O.)
        Blue is cold.
23.

                     GRAHAM
         Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-
         brown for all I care...
               (beat)
         Look, I'm sorry. When I come home,
         we'll go to the paint store together
         and get some chips and...

Molly interrupts:

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
         Will, I don't know why I'm talking
         about this stuff...
               (beat)
         I called to tell you: I love you
         and I miss you. And you are doing
         the right thing. It's costing
         you, too. And I know that. And
         I'm here. I'LL be here whenever
         you come home. Or I'LL meet you
         anywhere.  Anytime. That's what I
         called to say...

Graham holds the phone close to him. As if it were a part of
Molly herself.

                     GRAHAM
         Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now,
         baby. ..

                     MOLLY (V.O.)


                     GRAHAM
         I love you...

WIDE SHOT: GRAHAM

slowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on
the bed. All over the room are clothes out of drawers and
closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half-
packed.

                                       CUT TO:

INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE
DR. CHILTON - DAY

                     DR. CHILTON
         Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr.
         Graham. Or should I call you Dr.
         Graham?

                     GRAHAM (O.S.)
         I'm not a doctor.
               (beat)
         I need to see Lecter in as much
         privacy as possible.
24.
 TWO SHOT
 Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears
 repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of
 Staff, but not gifted.

                      DR. CHILTON
         Dr. Lecter will stay in his room.
         That is absolutely the only place
         where he is not put in full body
         restraints. One wall of his room
         is a double barrier. I will have
         a chair put just outside.

                      GRAHAM
         I might have to show him some
         material that could stimulate him.

                      DR. CHILTON
         As long as it's on soft paper.
         You may(Pause) find this curious.

 He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the
 spiky lines.

                      DR. CHILTON
         Here Lecter's resting on the
         examining table getting an
         electrocardiogram. Complained of
         chest pains. Pulse seventy-two.
         Here he grabs the nurse's head and
         pulls her down to him. Here he's
         subdued by the attendant and
         Lecter's shoulder is dislocated.
         Do you notice the strange thing?
                 (pause)
         His pulse never got over eighty-
         five. Even when he tore into her
         face.

 Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a.
 response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is
 a blank.

                      DR. CHILTON
         The consensus around here is that
         the only person who has demonstrated
         any practical understanding of Dr.
         Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham.
         Can you tell me anything about him?

                     GRAHAM
         No.







25 .

                      DR. CHILTON
         When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders,
         their 'style,' so to speak, were you
         able to reconstruct his fantasies?
         And did that help you identify him?


DR. CHILTON

looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility.
Right now he's seeing some more.

                      GRAHAM
                (stands)
         I want to see Lecktor now.

                     DR. CHILTON
         Uh... sure...


INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY

We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters.
An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the
bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN
and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer
to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single
chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now:


GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL

A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham
from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The
occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In
the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the
cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He
appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not
stirred. Then:

                      LECKTOR
         That's the same atrocious aftershave
         you wore in court three years ago.

                      GRAHAM
         I keep getting it for Christmas.


CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD

turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain.
Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham
is the patient.
                      LECKTOR
         Did you get my card?

                     GRAHAM
         I got it. Thank you.
26.


GRAHAM' S
struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his
emotional reactions.

              LECKTOR
      And how is Officer Stuart? The one
      who was the first to see my basement.

              GRAHAM
      Stuart is fine.

              LECKTOR
      Emotional problems, I hear. He was
      a very promising young officer. Do
      you ever have any problems, Will?

              GRAHAM
      No.

              LECKTOR
      Of course, you don't.
          (pause)
      I'm glad you came. My callers are
      all professional. Clinical
      psychiatrists from cornfield colleges
      somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.

              GRAHAM
      Dr. Bloom showed me your article on
      surgical addiction in the journal
      of Clinical Psychiatry.

              LECKTOR
      And?

              GRAHAM
      Very interesting, even to a layman.

Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his
head. Then:

              LECKTOR
      A layman.., layman. Interesting
      term. So many experts on government
      grants. And you say you're a
      'layman?' But it was you who caught
      me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know
      how you did it'

              GRAHAM
      You've read the transcript. It's
      all there.

              LECKTOR
      No it's not. Do you know how you
      Did it Will?

27.
        GRAHAM
It's in the transcript. What does
it matter now?

        LECKTOR
    (smiles)
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

        GRAHAM
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.

        LECKTOR
Yes, I thought so.

        GRAHAM
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.

        LECKTOR
Yes .

        GRAHAM
You read about it, I'm sure.

        LECKTOR
In the papers. I don't rear out the
articles.
    (laughs)
I wouldn't want them to think I was
dwelling on anything morbid. You
want to know how he's choosing them,
don't you?

        GRAHAM
I thought you would have some ideas.

        LECKTOR
Why should I tell you?

        GRAHAM
There are things you don't have.
Research materials... I could speak
to the Chief of Staff...?

        LECKTOR
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He
fumbles at your head like a freshman
pulling at a panty girdle.
    (laugh;)
He actually tries to give me a
Thematic and Apperception test.
Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to
come up. It's a card with a woman
in bed and a man in the foreground.
I was supposed to avoid a sexual
interpretation. I laughed in his
face.
    (beat)
Never mind, it's boring.

28.

               GRAHAM
      You'll get to see the file on this
      case. And there's another reason.

              LECKTOR
      Pray tell.

               GRAHAM
      I thought you might be curious to
      find our if you're smarter than
      the person I'm looking for.

               LECKTOR
      Then by implication, you think that
      you are smarter than me, since you
      caught me.

               GRAHAM
      No. I knew that I'm nor smarter
      than you are.

               LECKTOR
      Then how did you catch me, Will?

              GRAHAM
      You had disadvantages.

              LECKTOR
      What disadvantage?.

              GRAHAM
      You're insane.


              LECKTOR
      You're very tan, Will.

Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a
tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to
Lecktor.

               LECKTOR
      Your hands are rough. They don't
      look like a cop s hands anymore.
      That shaving lotion is something a
      child would select. It has a ship
      on the bottle, doesn't it?

Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling
into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to
find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then
relaxes:

               LECKTOR
      Don't think you can persuade me with
      appeals to my intellectual vanity.


29.


              GRAHAM
     I don't think I'll persuade you.
     You'll do it or you won't. Dr.
     Bloom is working an it anyway, and
     he's the best...

              LECKTOR
          (interrupts)
     Do you have the file with you

             GRAHAM
     Yes.

             LECKTOR
     Pictures?

             GRAHAM
     Yes.

              LECKTOR
     let me have them,, and I might
     consider it.

             GRAHAM
     No.

             LECKTOR
     Do you dream much, Will?

             GRAHAM
     Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

              LECKTOR
     You haven't threatened to take away
     my books yet.

Graham gets up and starts to walk away.

              LECKTOR
     let me have the file. Then I'll
     tell you what I think.


Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant.
Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding
tray. Lecktor pulls it through.


GRAHAM
sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take
one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:






30.

GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP
DR. LECKTOR

Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour-
nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with-
no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc
All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light.
Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The
shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high
resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a
hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the
mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:

              LECKTOR (O.S.)
      There is a very shy boy, Will.


GRAHAM

snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor.

              LECKTOR
      What were the yards like?

              GRAHAM
      Big backyards, fences, some hedges,
      why?

              LECKTOR
      Because, my dear Will, if this
      Pilgrim imagines he has a
      relationship with the full moon,
      he might go outside and look at it.
      Have you seen blood in moonlight,
      Will? It appears quite black. If
      one were nude, it would be better
      to have outdoor privacy for this
      sort of thing.

              GRAHAM
      That's interesting.

              LECKTOR
      It's not 'interesting'. You thought
      of it before.

              GRAHAM
      Yes. I'd considered it.

              LECKTOR
      You came here to look at me, Will.
      To get the old scent again, didn't
      you?

              GRAHAM
      I want your opinion.


31.

                       LECKTOR
          I don't have one right now.

                       GRAHAM
          When you do have one I'd like to
          hear it.

                      LECKTOR
          May I keep the file?

                      GRAHAM
          I haven't decided yet.

                       LECKTOR
          I'll study it, Will. When you get
          more files, I'd like to see them,
          too. You can call me. When I
          have to call my lawyer, they bring
          me a telephone. Would you like to
          give me your home number?

Threat.


                       GRAHAM
          No.

                       LECKTOR
          Do you know how you caught me,
          Will?

                       GRAHAM
          Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can
          leave messages for me at the number
          on the file.

Graham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked.
Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to
get unlocked faster!

                       LECKTOR
          Do you know how you caught me?

The door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run
through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears
is :

                       LECKTOR (O.S.)
          The reason you caught me, Will, is:
          we're just alike. You want the
          scent? Smell yourself.

The DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor.

INT. CHESAPEAKE: STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY
INSANE, CORRIDOR - GRAHAM - DAY

walks down the corridor. He's very stiff. He's walking
towards the outside door. The door is a rectangle of white
light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly
polished institution's floor. Graham walks for the light.

EXT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY

The DOOR SLAMS open and Graham comes out into daylight and
air. The air is tactile to him. He can almost feel the
motes of dust and light that swim freely. He breathes.


GRAHAM'S POV: GRASS

is dappled with pointillist points of color: a spectral
breakup. As it returns to a normal green...


TIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM

breathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building:
"CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE." He
leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image
is flattened in a LONG LENS. We hear a CLICK. It FOCUSES
and DE-FOCUSES.

INT. G:,TEWAY LABS - SCREEN DIVIDED INTO FOUR QUADRANTS - DAV

The quadrants display 4 home movies at six times normal
speed: an old couple, 2 men, a baby and a family. The fam-
ily quadrant slows to normal. We TIGHTEN in on it. We will
come to know these people as the SHERMANS. An 11-year-old boy,
a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade
sign says:   "THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL." Mrs. Sherman has
brown hair.  She wears a bikini.   She has a nice body. She's
sensuous and tan in her thirties.  She dives into the pool.
The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs.
Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair.

33.

A couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the
image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool
and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis-
tening. Her teeth are white. She smiles at the camera.
Whoever controls the console puts Mrs. Sherman in reverse.
It runs forward again. Mrs. Sherman's glistening body coming
our of the water...


REAR SHOT: CONSOLE AND A MAN

Beyond is the screen. The man at the console is FRANCIS
DOLLARHYDE. He has a weightlifter's body. We don't see his
face. Black goggles with red lenses are on the console. He
puts them on and watches Mrs. Sherman...

in the brilliant aluminum and peach cafeteria gets coffee.
A newspaper's under his arm. As he waits to pay, EILEEN
approaches. She, too, wears goggles, but on a lanyard around
her neck. She's petite, fragile. Dollarhyde towers over her.

                     EILEEN
         Mr. Dollarhyde?

CLOSER - DOLLARHYDE

looks up.


34.

His face bears the scars of a Z-plast procedure to fix a
harelip and cleft palate. Immediately, in characteristic
gesture, he curls his right hand under his nose to hide
his Z-plast scars.

                     DOLLARHYDE
         Yes, Eileen.

                     EILEEN

         Bill told me to tell you there was
         a variation in the gamma of the
         number three developer. But he
         caught it.

                     DOLLARHYDE
         And?

                     EILEEN
         On the densitometer it came out
         within tolerances.

                     DOLLARHYDE
         Thank you, Eileen.

Graciously Dollarhyde lets her go first and then he crosses
to an empty table. He opens his newspaper.


TRACK ACROSS FRANCIS DOLLARHME'S BACK

where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and
past his cheap haircut's line at the nape of his neck into
his left shoulder to reveal he's reading the National Tattler.
It's about Will Graham with a Freddie Lounds byline. The
only words we catch are: "FBI Manhunter Consults Fiend Who
Tried To Kill Him, by Freddie Lounds." We also catch: "The
Tooth Fairy - Psychopathic Slayer of Entire Families in
Birmingham and Atlanta..."


CLOSE: FRANCIS DOLLABHYDE

takes off the black goggles with red lenses. His eyes are
white violet. He turns the page.


NATIONAL TATTLER'S OLD PICTURE OF GRAHAEI

It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor.
It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a
myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary
colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals.
The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover-
ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal'
Lecktor."


35.

 EXTREMELY CLOSE: SECOND IMAGE OF WILL GRAHAM
 in newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi-
 tal. The half-tone dots comorising the image are visible.
 Dollarhyde's massive finger slides across the image, brush-
 ing it sensitively. It works its way to Graham's face and
 the finger stops and blots it out.

         Thank you so much. I'll call you
         when I'm finished.

 Attendant hesitates. Then he leaves. Lecktor is allowed to
 call his attorney in privacy.


 LECKTOR

 picks up the phone and punches in his number.

                      LECKTOR

         Linda doesn't come in nights.

                     LECKTOR
         Maybe you can help me. This is
         Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards
         Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom
         asked me to send a copy of 'The
         Psychiatrist and the Law' to
         someone. Linda never sent me the
         address and phone number.

                     GRADUATE STUDENT (V.O.)
         She'll be in, in the morning...

                     LECKTOR
         I have to catch Federal Express
         within about five minutes. I'd be
         immensely appreciative if you'd
         pull it out of her Rolodex for me.

There is a pause. Lecktor is waiting.

                     GRADUATE STUDENT (V.O.)
         She doesn't have a Rolodex.

                     LECKTOR
               (smiling)
         I'LL bet she has a call caddy right
         next to her phone.

         Yeah. ..

                     LECKTOR
         Well, zip that little Pointer right
         on down to the letter G.

         Okay.

                     LECKTOR
         We're looking for Graham. The man
         the book is supposed to go to is a
         Ms. Will Graham.

IT. HE KILLS THE PETS. REGARDS, CRAWFORD."

Clears the trays.

GRAHAM

contorts his body to pull his briefcase from under the seat
in front. He extracts the Leeds and Jacobi files. From each
he takes a snapshot of a happy family picture and paperclips
them to the front of the files. He stands them on the dinner
tray and stares at them.


GRAHAM'S POV: HAPPY FAMILY PORTRAITS

SLOWLY ZOOM IN TO the Jacobi family. As we get CLOSER and
CLOSER TO Mrs. Jacobi in a bikini, her face abstracts into

TRAY

The file has spilled open. Crime photos of the Leeds and
Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost
separated head of Mr. Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the
pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and
in his lap...


GRAHAM

mumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos. The

                     GEEHAN
            It was last Thursday. This
         couple from Duluth. I had them
         down to the short strokes talking
         mortgages -- I mean, that man could
         have written a check for the whole
         goddamn place. I'm figuring:
         Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you
         gonna unload this turkey.
               (beat)
         Then the squad car rolls up. They
         ask a coupla questions. The good
         officers give them the whole
         fuckin' guided tour. Who was
         laying where. Where all the blood
         sprayed... terrific!

         Off they go in their Sedan DeVille

         at it?

In the empty white living room. Graham walks OUT OF FRAME.
Bare floors and dead air. His footsteps echo in the empty

An image from Bill Owens' "Suburbia." A family house. No

REARSHOT: GRAHAM

starts backing up and we MOVE WITH him. He looks over his
shoulder at us and keeps walking backwards. Trees enter the
frame on the left and right.


TRACKING GRAHAM IN PROFILE

He stumbles through underbrush into a dry streambed. He
backs up a slope on the other side and finds himself in some
trees. There are three. Graham looks around.


BRANCHES


now obscure the Jacobi house. Something glints right...


SEARCHING THROUGH GRASS

At the base of one elm tree. A ring tab from a soft drink
can is half-buried in leaves. Graham's fingers move leaves
aside.



41.
GRAHAM

looks slowly up the tree trunk.


RED CREEK MUD

Wedged into the first strong limb, it's from the instep of
a boot.

GRAHAM

hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs
the far side of the elm. His head and his cheek raise
through limbs. His eye is six inches away when he finds a
soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk.

             GRAHAM

     I love it. Sweet Jesus, yes come
     on, can.

He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt,
bracketing exposures. Then he tears a small branch and uses
it to put the can in an evidence bag. Graham climbs higher
until his foot is level to where he saw the mud. He looks
to his left. Something he sees stops him cold.


A SYMBOL

is carved in the wood.


GRAHAM

photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by
a cutting tool. Then he looks...


OVER GRAHAM'S SHOULDER: THE JACOBI HOUSE

A perfect view.

GRAHAM

high in the tree, leans back against the trunk. Re seems
frozen. Then:

             GRAHAM
          (mumbling to himself)
     ... after you killed the cat and
     threw it into the yard, my man,
     you climbed up hero and waited.
     You used a cutting tool on these
     branches so you could see.

Graham waves Crawford to the other phone.

               DR. CHILTON (V.O.)
      From Hannibal Lecktor's cell. It

      Book code?

               BOWMAN
     'One hundred prayers' could be the

     be line and letter. But what book?

              CBAWFORD
     Not the Bible?

               BOWMAN
     No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians
     has only six chapters. The same
     with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four
     chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a
     Bible.

               GRAHAM
     Then the Tooth Fairy named the
     book in the part Lecktor tore out.

               BOWMAN
     Right .
           (beat)
     What about sweating Lecktor?

     it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy
     would know Lecktor has in his cell.

               GRAHAM
     He'd know it from articles he's
     read about Lecktor...

               CRAWFORD
           (looks at watch)
      We let Lecktor's message run as is
      and decode it after. Or we pull
      it, work our the code and put ours
      in next week.

               GRAHAM
      Can we still get Lecktor's message
      out of the paper?

               CRAWFORD
      Yes. And I'm leery of running
      Lecktor's message without knowing
      what it says.

Graham has to decide. Long pause. Then he looks up:

      Run it.

               CRAWFORD
      What if it encourages the Tooth

Finally, he stirs, then fights his way up out of sleep.

         Will, Bowman just broke the code. It
         was a James Beard cook book. You

feels vulnerable. The dappled leaves whip across her face

      I found a curly piece of metal in
      the clothes of one of the girls.
      The kind of shred a pipe threader
      makes. I was taking a look at
      steam fitters, plumbers. It took
      a long time. In one place there
      was a resignation letter from a
      man named Hobbs. I saw it and it
      was.., peculiar.
           (beat)
      I was going up these stairs to
      Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway
      up when he shoved his wife down
      at me. She was dying.
           (beat)
      I sent the officer with me to call
      a SWAT team. But I could hear kids
      in there and screaming. I couldn't
      wait .

               KEVIN
      You went in the apartment?

               GRAHAM
      Yes. Hobbs had one of his
      daughters from behind. He was
      cutting her. I shot him.


We get the feeling Graham is leaving out lots of pieces and
gives Kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know.


               GRAHAM
      I kept thinking there must be some
      way I could have handled it better.
      It kept replaying in my mind.
      Later I got depressed. A doctor
      friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked
      me to go into a hospital. After a
      while I got some distance on it
      and was okay.


               KEVIN
      Did the girl die?

               GRAHAM
      No.

               KEVIN
      She got all right?

               GRAHAM
      ...after a while.

               KEVIN
      And Hobbs died?

               GRAHAM

Kevin pauses, then asks with 11-year-old innocence:

               KEVIN
      Killing somebody feels that bad?

EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM
turns and stares at Kevin:

               GRAHAM
      Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in
      the world.

Kevin thinks about this for a long time. He nods. He feels
he understands Graham and is closer to him for it:

               KEVIN
      What kind of coffee do you like?

               GRAHAM
      Huh?

               KEVIN
      You like that Colombian stuff, don't
      you?

Kevin reaches for the coffee and puts it in the basket.

      Mom likes that, too.

      It's hard to have anything, isn't it?
      Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This

When she said this she was staring out to sea. Now she turns
to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm. He still stares
out to sea:

               GRAHAM
      Slick as hell.

Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own.

               MOLLY
      You remember when we first met?
      And were together alone in that
      room. And the exhilaration was
      too much to hold on to. And then
      something flickered across your
      face like a shadow and I asked you
      what was wrong?

               GRAHAM
      I remember.

               MOLLY
      Do you remember what you said?

      I need to talk to you about Will
      Graham.





71.

                BLOOM
What about him?

                CRAWFORD
I need to ask you questions of a
psychological nature.

                BLOOM
Remember when you asked for a
study on him, I refused. Same
goes for now.

                CRAWFORD
That was Peterson upstairs.

                BLOOM
It was you who did the asking.

                CRAWFORD
He doesn't think you run mind games
on him.

                BLOOM
I wouldn't presume to try.

                CRAWFORD
You're never alone in a room with
Graham, are you? You're smooth
about it, but you're never one-on-
one with him. Why's that? Do you
think he's psychic?

                BLOOM
He's an eideteker. He has almost
total recall.   But I don't think
he's psychic.   What he has it empathy
and projection  He can assume your
point of view and mine.., and some
other points of view that scare and
sicken him.


                CRAWFORD
Why aren't you ever alone with him?


                BLOOM
Because I'm professionally
concerned about him. And he'd
pick up on that. He's fast. He
hates being prodded and poked.
    (beat)
So do I.
    (beat)
What do you want?

                CRAWFORD
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs.
Could he kill again if he had to save
his life? Or would he hesitate?




72.


                BLOOM
      I'll tell you the events. The
      psychology's none of your business.
      Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven-
      year-old daughter's throat. Graham
      shot him with his .38 six times.
      Hobbs still didn't go down. He had
      to wade in...

               CRAWFORD
      That's when it happened?

                BLOOM
      No. It happened when Graham went
      to see Hobbs' daughter four months
      later in the hospital. She saved
      her carotid artery.., but lost
      three fingers and her larynx. She
      was connected up to a voice box.
      When Graham went to see her, she
      asked him -- through the speaker:
      'Why did you have to kill my
      daddy? '
           (beat)
      That's when Graham had his nervous
      breakdown.

               CRAWFORD
      What's the bottom line?

                BLOOM
      If he pushes too deep into our boy's
      mind-set, he may destroy himself.
           (beat)
      What are you planning, Jack?

                CRAWFORD
      Could he handle a direct contact?

               BLOOM
      I don't recommend it.

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      You don't recommend what, Sidney?

Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't.

                BLOOM
      Crawford has a proposition. I
      don't think it's a good idea.

                GRAHAM
      If the Tooth Fairy listens to
      Lecktor, he'll come for me. So
      we're going to set me up as bait
      to draw him out. Give him a
      clean shot.

Crawford's embarrassed. Bloom said Graham was fast.

               GXAHAM
      I'll use Lounds.

Now Bloom's surprised...


               GRAHAM
      Sidney, he doesn't read the "Sunday
      Times literary supplement. He
      reads Lounds in the "Tattler."

INT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT - GRAHAM + LOUNDS - DAY
Graham leans against a table, his back to a window.
               GRAHAM
      I believe he's socially
      maladjusted. Laughed at by his
      contemporaries...

               LOUNDS
      How does he rate compared to Dr,
      Hannibal Lecktor?

               GRAHAM
      He's not as intelligent.


PULL BACK to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and
assistant. Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his
tape recorder.

               GRAHAM
          (to Bloom)
      What have we missed?

               BLOOM
      He may have an unconscious
      homosexual conflict. A fear of
      being gay. He objects to the word
      'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains
      indicate that he put the shorts on
      Charles Leeds after he was dead.
      I believe he did this to emphasize
      his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds.

Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again.







74.
                 GRAHAM
       The killer has sexually molested
       all his male victims. He is a
       homosexual and impotent with
       persons of the opposite sex.
           (beat)
       Our forensic psychologists have
       projected he may have been the
       product of an incestuous home
       life .
           (added afterthought)
       And probably had sexual relations
       with his mother...

Crawford stifles a laugh...

                LOUNDS
       How long will you stay in
       Washington?

                GBAHAM
       Until we've taken out the Tooth
       Fairy.

Graham gestures for Lounds to turn off the tape recorder.

                GRAHAM
       All right. Let's shoot the
       pictures .

                LOUNDS
           (to Crawford)
       I want shots with me and Graham
       together .


Graham reacts.

                LOUNDS
       C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You want
       this to look real, don't you?



STILL PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV THROUGH CAMERA: GRAHAM + LOUNDS

Lounds lays Graham's arm over his own shoulder and mugs :or
the camera. Behind him is the flood-lit Capitol dome and
the sign of a motel across the street.


                GRAHAM
       Keep the motel sign across the
       street just slightly out of focus.
       He has to be able to read it, but
       it can't look too obvious.


Lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits.
The photographer starts breaking down his gear. Crawford
takes Graham aside.

      hear?

               GRAHAM
      Pretty well.

               SPURGEN
      I'm gonna spray your suit jackets.
      It'll be invisible in this light,
      but you'll stand out like a zebra
      for us.
           (beat)
      They told me you checked out a .44
      Charter Arms Bulldog.

               GI(AHAM
      Yes .

               SPURGEN
      Good. You'll load these, Ever
      fire them?

Spurgen hands Graham a glycine envelope containing 25 rounds
of .44 Special ammunition.



GRAHAM EXAMINES ONE ROUND

Instead of a lead bullet, there's a matte-black, blunt-nosed
cylinder .

      seven out of eight times'

               SPURGEN
      You got it.

               GRAHAM
      Let's walk the route.

As they start across the parking lot:

                            CUT TO:


INT. LAMBERT ST. LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - FLOOR
DAY

We've been here before. The floor is empty. In the WIDE
ANGLE -- OUT OF FOCUS -- the NEWSSTAND OPERATOR is squatted
down reading the "Chicago Tribune." In the empty space is
dumped a bundle of "Tattlers" A pair of black zippered boots
enters and stands behind the man.


                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
           (without looking)
      What is it?

               VOICE (O.S.)
      A "Tattler."

               NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
      You'll have to wait until I bust a
      bundle.

One black boot kicks the "Tattler" bundle.

               VOICE (O.S.)
      Now.





77.

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
           (hot)
       I said wait 'til I bust a bundle.
       Understand?

A hand and a flash of bright steel rip through the FRAME.
The wire is cut with a POP. A dollar bill is thrown on
the floor. The hand whips a "Tattler" out from the center of
the bundle. RAISE UP WITH the outraged Newsstand Operator.

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
       Hey. Hey you.

The retreating man turns to face him. It is Francis
Dollarhyde.

                DOLLARHYDE
       Me?

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
       Yeah, you. Fuckin' told you...

                DOLLARHYDE
              (interrupting)
            You told me what?

He starts coming back. He rakes off his silver sunglasses
revealing the white violet eyes.

                DOLLARHYDE
       You told me what?!


CLOSE: NEWSSTAND OPERATOR

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
       You got a quarter comin' back.

                            CUT TO:


EXT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT, PARKING LOT - GRAHAM'S CAR -
NIGHT

pulls into the prescribed space. It's raining. He kills the
engine and gets out.


HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM

exiting the car. The image is in GREEN AND BLACK. We are:

EXT. ROOFTOP - SWAT #1

behind the balustrade in a prone firing position sighting
through a heavy-barrelled Heckler and Koch Model 93 with a
Startron scope.







78.

A SECOND HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM
also in GREEN AND BLACK. Reveal we are:



EXT. SECOND ROOFTOP - SWAT #2

with the same rifle sweeping the parking lot. He reacts to
something to his left.



GRAHAM

... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the
apartment building.., hears something through the delicate
patter of the rain.



GRAHAM'S POV: CORNER OF BUILDING

A distant "plop-plop-plop" of running feet...


GRAHAM'S
eyes tighten.


CORNER OF BUILDING

HOLD. Then entering around the corner is a running MAN.
He's 6'2". He's heavy and wears a running suit with the
hood up. His face is lost in its shadow.



RUNNER'S RIGHT HAND

is gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket, grasping
something...



RUNNER'S FEET ACROSS WET BLACK TARMAC
splash through shallow puddles.


GRAHAM'S FACE

in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER...



GBAHAM'S EYES

like taut wire about to snap.







79.
WIDE PROFILE:  GRAHAM
on the left.   The Runner enters on the right. In SLOW MOTION
as they cross, Graham slams him sideways...


RUNNER

is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side
of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to
fight ...


.44 BULLDOG

comes up.., pressure on the trigger.


RUNNER'S HEAD

turns INTO CAMERA. He is a black man with a moustache and
scared eyes staring into the .44. His hands shoot into the
air:

               RUNNER (MAN)
      Yo, boss. Plastic and cash in the
      right pocket...!

               GRAHAM
               (re the mistake)
      God-dammit!!!

Walking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest.
Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive.
The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two
D.C. cops are running in.


               RUNNER
      Arrest dat sucker...!

Crawford catches up to Graham:


               CRAWFORD
      You okay?

Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest
across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile,
Spurgen is with the Runner.


               SPURGEN
      It was a mistake . Sorry we...



               RUNNER
      'Sorry' yo' mama!!

Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops
him.




80.

                SPURGEN
       Hold on! We thought you were
       someone we're trying to catch...

                RUNNER
            (backs up)
       Hold onto this!!
            (grabs his groin)
       I get dat cannon stuck up mah
       face?! Car dirt splattered up
       and down mah Calvin Kleins?!

       'Catch somebody?!' You couldn't
       catch yo' ass with yo' right hand!
       You lucky you muther-fuckers catch
       a cold! Who the hell goin' pay my
       cleanin' bill? Huh?

HUGE LAUGHTER which is coming from...

                            CUT TO:


INT. "TATTLER" GARAGE - ELEVATOR DOOR - NIGHT

slides open. Lounds and TWO SECRETARIES are cracking up.
He apparently told them the funniest joke they ever heard.

                SECRETARY
       See you, Freddie.


LOUNDS


pleased with himself, walks to his car.


REAR: LOUNDS' HEAD

enters FRAME, unlocking his car door. A hand falls on
Lounds' shoulder and turns him INTO CAMERA: Lounds' self-
satisfied smile still beams. A chloroformed rag jams
into his face. A massive hand holds his head and neck
steady and is nor bothered by his struggles.


                            CUT TO:


INT. DOLLARHYDE HOUSE (ST. LOUIS) - LOUNDS - NIGHT

is unconscious. A hand puts ammonia under his nose.
Lounds regains consciousness. He tries to move. He can't.
There are sanitary napkins covering Lounds' eyes and mouth.
The one on his mouth is removed. We will see ONLY Lounds.

                DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
       Are you cold? Would you like a
       blanket?




81.

               LOUNDS
      Was I in an accident?

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.

               LOUNDS
      My back hurts, my skin. Did I get
      burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Burned? Burned. No. You just
      rest there. I'll be right back.

               LOUNDS
      Let me lie down.  Listen, I want
      to call my office. My God, I'm in
      a Stryker frame.  My back's broken.
      Tell me the truth.

Footsteps are going away.

               LOUNDS
      What am I doing here?

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

Lounds reacts.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      I don't want to know.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      According to you I'm a sexual
      failure. An animal, you said.
           (beat)
      You know now, don't you?

               LOUNDS
      Yes .

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you feel privileged?

               LOUNDS
      I'm very scared.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      Yes .








82.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you believe God is in attendance
      here, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      I don't know...

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      In a little while I'll help you
      understand.

A kettle WHISTLES.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      I'll be right back.
           (singsong)
      Don't... go away...

As if he had any choice. Lounds' face moves; He strains.
His arms are glued to the chair. Dollarhyde's hand comes
back with a cup of tea and a straw. Lounds sips.

               LOUNDS
      I'd do a big story. Anything you
      want to say. Describe you any way
      you want or no description!

The hand rips off the sanitary napkins covering Lounds' eyes.
Lounds jams his eyes shut. The lights brighten. A single
finger taps the top of his head.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.

               LOUNDS
      No. I don't want to see you.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
      You're here to titillate your
      readers. If you don't open your
      eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to
      your forehead.

A finger taps Lounds on his chest. A touch on his eyelids.
Lounds slowly opens his eyes. His face goes white.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (singsong)
      Well: here...I...am...


LOUNDS' POV: THE RED DRAGON

Dollarhyde opens and drops the black silk kimono.









83.

His muscular frame bears the full body tattoo of William
Blake's Red Dragon -- the head on Dollarhyde's chest, the
tail snaking down and wrapping around one of Dollarhyde's
legs. His back is to us in a weight-lifter's pose. A
rolled-up stocking covers Dollarhyde's head to just below
his nose. Dollarhyde's teeth are jagged and brown-stained.
And he smiles at Lounds in front of the white screen.

               LOUNDS (O.S.)
      Oh my dear God Jesus.


LOUNDS

turns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head.
The kimono is on again.


PAST LOUNDS' HEAD: SCREEN

A slide appears. It is Blake's painting.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Look at the screen. That is William
      Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and
      The Woman Clothed with the Sun.
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Yes ...

Next picture: Mrs. Jacobi, eyes wide.

               DOLLARHME
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Yes .

CLICK. Next slide. Mrs. Leeds alive, locked into a silent
scream in her bedroom.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Yes.

CLICK.


LOUNDS

staring in horror. We will not see the rest of the slider.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood,
      her husband beside her. Do you see?






84.

               LOUNDS
      Yes .

                DOLLARHYDE
      Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
           (as Lounds nods)
      The Dragon rampant. Do you see?


               LOUNDS
      Yes .

               DOLLARHYDE
      Freddie Lounds. Your photograph.

      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Oh, God.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Please, no.

               DOLLARHYDE
      'No' what?

               LOUNDS
      Not me.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Are you a man?

               LOUNDS
      Yes.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Do you imply that I'm a queer?

               LOUNDS
      God, no.

               DOLLARHYI)E
      Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      No.



REAR OF DOLLARHYDE'S HEAD

Beyond him is the screen and the image of Freddie Lounds with
Graham's arm over his shoulder.








85.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Before me you are a slug in the sun.
      You are privy to a great becoming
      and you recognize nothing. You are
      an ant in the afterbirth.
           (beat)
      It is your nature to do only one
      thing correctly: tremble. Bur fear
      is not what you owe me. Lounds:
      you and the others, YOU OWE ME AWE!
           (long pause)
      We have one more piece of work to do.

Dollarhyde leaves. Lounds closes his eyes.

                LOUNDS
           (to himself)
        Didn't take off the mask. Please,
      God, let him not take off the mask.
      If he comes back with it off, I'm dead...


DOLLARHME'S HAND

carries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds'
face .
                DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.

Lounds obeys.


CLOSE: DOLLARHYDE

The stocking mask and teeth -- stained and jagged -- are in
place.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Now you will read this into the
      tape recorder.


ON LOUNDS

                LOUNDS
      'I have had a great privilege. I have
      seen with wonder the strength of the
      Red Dragon. All I wrote about him
      before was lies from Will Graham. He
      made me write them. Now I understand.
           (beat)
      'Will Graham: you will learn from my
      own lips how much you have to dread.
      Because I was forced to lie, he will
      be more merciful to me than to you.
           (beat)
      'I will be a testament to the truth, now.
      About his work. About his becoming.'






86.

DOLLARHYDE'S HAND
turns off the tape recorder.

                DOLLARHYDE
      You did very well.   I apologize for
      the crude images.    Next time I'll
      have film stock that doesn't need
      lights .

               LOUNDS
      You'll let me go now?

               DOLLARHYDE
      You will tell the truth?

               LOUNDS
      Absolutely,

DOLLARHYDE
      Good .
           (beat)
      We'll seal your promise with...


DOLLARHYDE'S FACE,

with the stocking rolled down over his nose, smiles his
dentured smile. And with his kimono open, revealing the
face of the dragon emblazoned in crimson on his muscular
torso; he leans INTO CAMERA...


               DOLLARHYDE
      ... with a kiss.



VERY WIDE ANGLE

The figures seen from the back. We don't know what Dollar-
hyde, leaning over Lounds, is doing, but Lounds screams.

                            CUT TO:



EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT

Dollarhyde's van is on the left against the wall. The alley
is empty. Then we see shapes between the van and the wall.



CLOSER: OVER LOUNDS' RIGHT SHOULDER

We do not see his face. We see his shoulder and his lap.
From an unseen facial wound, blood drips onto his pants' leg.
Dollarhyde starts spilling liquid on Lounds. Lounds starts
to moan and rouse from unconsciousness. His head starts to
turn. He knows he's going to die. And he has some courage.




87.

               LOUNDS
      Go 'head and kill 'ee, you 'astard!
      You rot in 'ell. rot in 'ell!

INT. "TATTLER" GARAGE - OVER PARKING ATTENDANT'S RIGHT
SHOULDER ON THE RACING FORM - NIGHT

He pencils some selections. START TRACKING LEFT ACROSS
the back of his neck. Midway we hear the SQUEAK of a wheel-
chair. The parking attendant hears it, too. As the TRACK
CONTINUES OVER his left shoulder he puts down the Racing
form and looks. Nothing. Then he goes back to the Racing
Form.


PARKING ATTENDANT

reads. Now the wheels SQUEAK and ECHO LOUDER. His head
raises again...


OVER PARKING ATTENDANT'S LEFT SHOULDER

He turns INTO CAMERA. There's a loud WOOSH. His eyes go
wide. He explodes out of his chair, SCREAMING.


WHAT HE SEES: LOUNDS IN WHEELCHAIR - A MAN AFLAME

Lounds is a fireball racing TOWARDS US. Just before the
fireball would smash into CAMERA...

                            CUT TO:


INT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GRAHAM + MOLLY - NIGHT

Graham and Molly are sitting at the kitchen table over cups
of coffee. It's dark. Graham is looking down into the Formica.
He and Molly say nothing for a long time. Then:

               MOLLY
      Can I have one of your cigarettes?

               GRAHAM
           (surprised)
      You haven't smoked in two years.

               MOLLY
      I'd like one of your cigarettes,
      please.

Graham gives her one. Molly lights up. She picks a piece or
tobacco from her lips. She's trying to control fear.







88.

               MOLLY
      Have you ever omitted telling me.
      things before?

               GRAHAM
      No.

               MOLLY
      Then why?

               GRAHAM
      I wanted it over fast.
           (beat)
      It felt dirty to not tell you.

               MOLLY
      Can you quit?

               GRAHAM
      No.

               MOLLY
      And... where are things?

               GRAHAM
      Where we're at is nowhere. We have
      nothing. We're running out of time.

There is a long pause. Molly suspects:

               MOLLY
      What will you do?

               GRAHAM
      I have to go back to Birmingham.

               MOLLY
      Is Crawford going with you?

               GRAHAM
      No. I have to be. in there...       
      alone. Maybe there's something for
      me if I know how he feels and thinks.

               MOLLY
      William: you are going to make
      yourself Sick or get yourself killed.

Graham says nothing.

               MOLLY
      Kevin and I have lived through... with
      Kevin's father... once before... and
      we can't...

She can't finish. There's a pause. Then: She looks at him.








89.

                GRAHAM
      You should go to Montana. Stay with
      Kevin's grandparents. They haven't
      seen him for a while.
           (beat)
      I'll come and get you afterwards...

                MOLLY
      Will


He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about
himself:

                GRAHAM
      Molly.
           (pause)
       I love you. And I'm not really
      going to be fit to be with for
      awhile...


They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate.
Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham
sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around
his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the
mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen.


                            CUT TO:

      To witness the act. We know he
      thinks the act is making him into
      something different. His 'becoming'
      ...but I don't know what it is he
      thinks he's becoming.
           (beat)
      The answer is something to do with
      how he uses the mirrors. That's
      what's missing for me. why the
      mirrors?

                BLOOM (V.O.)
      The usual motivation doesn't apply
      to him, nor the way he uses them.
      I don't have an answer for you.

      Listen to me, my friend: leave this.

AFTERNOON

Outside is gray. Rain stripes the glass. Sheets of rain
whip across the silver planes and yellow utility vehicles.



CLOSE: WINDOW

Graham's hand enters and flattens against his half-reflection
on the cool glass. He hears:

               VALERIE LEEDS (V.O.)
           (ansaphone
           recording )
      'Hello. This is Valerie Leeds. I'm

               GRAHAM
      I'm sorry, too...

               WAITRESS
      Excuse me...?

Graham turns. The WAITRESS looks at him strangely.

               GRAHAM
      Coffee ...

She leaves. Graham sits. He stares at his handprint and
says :

                GRAHAM
      It's just YOU and me now, sport.
      And I'd better hurry up and find you.

INT. DARKROOM - DOLLABHYDE - NIGHT

Entering. It is almost totally dark. In the green dullness
we make our the forms of a WOMAN and Dollarhyde.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde.
      I came about the low light level
      infrared film stock.

                REBA (WOMAN)
Put your back against the doer.
      Come forward three steps until you
      feel the tile an your feet and there
      will be a stool just to your left.

We see Dollarhyde's form follow instructions and sit.

                REBA
Can you give me an idea of the
      conditions...

               DOLLARHYDE
      Shooting at maybe eight feet. I
      can't use any lights.

               REBA
      What's being photographed?

               DOLLARHYDE
      The activities of nocturnal animals.

               REBA
      When do you need it?

               DOLLARHYDE
      In eight days.

                REBA
      Let me stick this in the black hole.

We see some movements. Then the light comes on.

DOLLARHYDE'S

hand is curled under his nose, hiding his Z-plast scars.
Then he reacts to something. His face lights up in an
uncharacteristically open smile.







92.

He brazenly looks the woman up and down. We don't understand
why he can do this.


REBA McCLAIN

is blind. Her white cane is propped in the corner. She's
thirty with a handsome prairie face.

                REBA
      The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film
      must be handled in total darkness.
      I keep the samples straight by touch
      code .
           (beat)
      It's still easier to handle than a
      1200 series. Think it'll do?

               DOLLARHYDE
      It'll do fine.


RALPH DANDRIDGE,

young manager of the department enters, checks watch.

                DANDRIDGE
      Reba, dear, I've got to fly.
           (beat)
      Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be
      too much trouble could you help her
      home ?

                REBA
      I can 'help' myself home, Ralph...

Dandridge leaves. Dollarhyde stares after him. He doesn't
Like him. Then:

               DOLLARHYDE
      I'LL take you.

                BEBA
           (standing close)
      No, thanks. I manage very well.
           (beat)
      I'LL order you twelve hundred feet:

Reba walks our of the dark room.

                            CUT TO:


INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN, TRAVELLING - OUT OF WINDOW - NIGHT

We pass Reba on the sidewalk. She is walking briskly with
her cane and tapping in front of her. She's very confident.






93.

                DOLLARHYDE
       Ride with me.

                REBA
       Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I
       do it all the time.

DOLLARHYDE
       Dandridge is a condescending prick.
       Ride with me. It would be because
       I want you to.

Reba stops. She likes Dollarhyde's directness. He gets our
and comes around to help her in. He starts to take her arm.

                REBA
       It's better if I rake your arm.

                            CUT TO:


INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - DOOR - NIGHT

We hear footsteps come up. Reba's key is in the lock.
As the door is starting to open:

                REBA
       Come on in.
           (beat)
       How about a gin and tonic?


                DOLLARHYDE
       Tonic will be fine.


                REBA
       In the kitchen.


INT. REBA'S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - REBA

enters. She momentarily forgets, retraces her steps and
turns on the light. She opens the refrigerator. During
the next pieces of dialogue, we will see Reba being ex-
tremely competent making the drinks.

                DOLLARHYDE
       How did you come to Gateway?


                BEBA
       They had to shape up their employment
       practices to keep this defense
       contract.

Reba takes a l0-inch chef's knife and deftly cuts the lime,
guiding it with her thumb.

                DOLLARHYDE
       You worked out well.



94.

                REBA
      You know you speak very well,
      although you avoid fricatives and
      sibilants in your speech. At the
      Riker Institute for the Blind. I
      trained in speech therapy for speech
      and hearing impaired children...


DOLLARHYDE

reacts to "speech therapy." Characteristically -- his
attention goes to:


KNIFE

in Reba's hand. Its extremely sharp cutting edge glints
in the light. Another slice of lime falls.

                REBA
      I'll probably go back to it someday.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Uh-huh.

Silence. Reba hands him his drink.

                REBA.
      If you don't want to talk. okay.
      Bur I hope you will... because I
      like what you say.

Dollarhyde is stunned, at both her perception and frankness.

                REBA
      May I touch your face?
           (as Dollarhyde reacts)
      I want to know if you're smiling
      or frowning. I want to know if I
      should just shut up or not...

There's a smile on her face. Now her hand moves up towards
Dollarhyde's mouth with the Z-plast scars where his harelip
and cleft palate were fixed.


REBA' S HAND

Dollarhyde's fist grabs it.


DOLLARHYDE


turns her hand in the light.








95.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Take my word for it that I'm...
      smiling .

There is no smile on Dollarhyde's face.

               RZBA
      If I've offended you, I didn't
      mean to.

He still has her hand in his grasp.

               DOLLARHYDE
      I have to go now.

He lets go of her hand.

It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic
clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them,


REARSHOT: GRAHAM

half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates
motes of dust in the air. Graham merely sits and stares
into all of the debris of this dead family. PULL BACK to
see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray
of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all
the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a
life by two adults and three children. Everything from
washing machines to tricycles to sleds. They litter the
vast floor space. While we WIDEN, we hear:

               VOICE :1(O.S.)
      What's he doin'? Been in there all
      day .

               VOICE :2 (O.S.)

The CAMERA now includes two UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS at
the door. They watch Graham, As we WIDEN and PULL BACK
they fall into REAR SHOT. HOLD.

INT. WHITE CORRIDOR - REBA ON DOLLARHYDE'S ARM - NIGHT

Her cane taps the white tile floor. It's antiseptic and
sinister. We worry about where he's taking her.

                REBA
      Ready to tell me what kind of
      'outing' this is?

               DOLLARHYDE
      It's a surprise.

Her head arcs back as she senses:

                REBA
      Francis? We're at the zoo...!

                REBA
           (aglow)
      Yes!


                DR. WARFIELD
      Are you apprehensive? Your protective
      and muscular gentleman over there is
      watching us like a cat.

               REBA
      No, no! I want to.

Dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment.

                DR. WARFIELD
      All right, put your left hand on the
      edge of the table and you can explore
      with your right. I'll be right here
      beside you.

We see Reba start to reach out. Then we see what she is about
to touch.


TEN-FOOT LONG BENGAL TIGER

Reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm.


REBA'S HAND

The fur springs between her fingers.










97.
TIGER'S GREAT PAW
Reba's hand enters down its foreleg. Warfield -- with two
hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. Reba's
hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the
claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy
supple muscles of his shoulder.


TIGER'S HEAD

Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands
feel the width of his head.


TIGER'S MOUTH

The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the
hairs on her forearms.


TIGER'S CHEST

Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face
lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's
ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills
us and Reba with its bright thunder.

INT. BATHROOM - FAUCET + HANDS

Hands are Reba's. We FOLLOW them up to the wall as they
search for and find a towel. O.S. we hear the hum of a

in the mirror. Feeling her way, she starts out...

98.


We MOVE-PAST objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors,
a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow
arms, a Magnavox console TV set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and
Reba on it. They're watching a movie.

                            DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSER: DOLLARHYDE AND REBA

The film projector hums. We don't see what movie Dollarhyde
is watching.

               REBA

           (beat)
      That was nice of you to think of that.

               DOLLARKYDE
      I made you a gin and tonic. It's by
      the side of the sofa...

Dollarhyde looks at Reba. Then he looks at the film. The
two of them are like a tableau of suburban TV-watching.
They're like a married couple sitting on the sofa. Except:


REAR SHOT OVER DOLLARHYDE + REBA TO THE SCBEEN

The movie is Mrs. Jacobi looking up, And Mrs. Leeds looking
up. And Mrs. Sherman's legs scissoring in the water. Then
her breasts swelling and shining above her suit as she pushes
herself our of the pool. Dollarhyde's blase, watching his
horror show. He looks at Reba.


REBA

unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity. Her breasts
rise and fall with her breathing. The flickering light from
the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes
of her face.


EXTREMELY CLOSE: REBA'S NECK

The smooth skin and down-like hairs undulate from the bearing
of her living heart.


DOLLARHYDE

is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and
doesn't see:

REBA'S HAND
moves along the back of the sofa to Dollarhyde.


REBA

moves towards Dollarhyde's face.


ON DOLLARHYDE, AND REBA

ENTERS THE FRAME and kisses Dollarhyde on the mouth.
Dollarhyde's eyes freeze open. He is stunned. Reba's left
hand opens Dollarhyde's shirt and slides down his' chest towards
his pants...

               REBA

      Let me get them off... it's torn...
      I don't care! Come on. My God, man.
      Yes ...

Reba's hand with her long, gentle fingers ENTERS THE FRAME
caressing the side of Dollarhyde's face. We will hear Reba's
voice and see little of her. We will see Dollarhyde's face
and the expressions on it: wonder and amazement.

               REBA (O.S.)
      You're so sweet, D...
           (heat )
        let me come up to you and take it...
           (beat)
      Yes...


Her hand moves down from his face down his neck and rests on
his chest. It rests on the face of what is tattooed there:

the Great Red Dragon.

               REBA (O.S.)
           (soft)
      Your heart is loud.

caresses her forehead and brushes light brown hair from her
face .


DOLLARHME

wide awake, eases her away. Then he puts his ear to her
breast and listens to her heart beating. Dollarhyde is re-
lieved. Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder
and amazement. Then Dollarhyde leaves...


REBA

Dollarhyde re-enters FRAME and puts a glass of water next to
her. He covers her. He lays down again next to her. Reba
stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily. Dollarhyde supports the
back of her head and offers her some water.


OVERHEAD ANGLE: DOLLARHYDE + REBA

Dollarhyde's arm moves under her pillow. She snuggles closer
to him. Dollarhyde's eyes are moist.  Reba's hand moves up
his stomach and rests on his chest.   It rests above his heart.
It rests on the face of the crimson dragon. When she is asleep
again, Dollarhyde takes her hand off the great tattoo and puts
it on his face.

Dollarhyde -- cloven in two, accepted by a living Reba -- will
not sleep for a very long time.

                            CUT TO:


SAME - DOLLARHYDE - DAY

It is morning. He snaps awake. he is horror-struck: Reba's

               DOLLARHYDE
      Yes, are you okay...?!

               REBA (O.S.)
      I'm fine.


REBA

In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and
presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown
weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.


DOLLARHYDE

nears her, towers above her. He touches her face. Reba folds
into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest. His heart
is going fast. He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen-
ing to him and that she's okay.

               REBA
      Good morning...
           (kisses his cheek)
      If you show me where things are,
      I'll make us some coffee...

               DOLLARHYDE
      No! Don't go back into the house...
          (to Reba's quizzical
           reaction)
           it's too nice outside.

               REBA
      My sister's coming by to pick me up
      for brunch. Why don't you come, too?

               DOLLARHYDE
      I have work to do at the plant.

               REBA
      I'll get my purse.

               DOLLARHYDE
      I'll get it.
           (leaving)
      Stay right here. You lock very good

EXT. SERVICE STATION - ATTENDANT - DAY


He's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls
in.







102.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?

               REBA
      I'm fine, Francis.

Dollarhyde gets out.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Fill it up and check the oil, please.

Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the
nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood,
draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout
into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he
starts to move around the van he sees something in the
interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't
know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He
wipes and wipes the same spot.


REBA'S

dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat.
Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats.
From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can
look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better...


MEN'S ROOM DOOR

Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel
and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the
backside of the van.


DRIVER'S WINDOW

Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on
the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...


ATTENDANT

unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same
spot in front of Reba.


DOLLARHYDE


is coming around the van. Fast.

               DOLLARHYDE
      You sonofabitch...

               ATTENDANT
           (cocky)
      You don't like it? You know what
      you can do about it...

Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him
into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once
and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...
Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it.


REBA'S FACE

through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to
roll down the window.


ATTENDANT

is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has
never seen before, anywhere.


DOLLARHYDE

pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He
advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end
of the spout.


ATTENDANT

is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the
man into the wall, compressing his thorax.

               DOLLARHYDE
      I ought to jam this in your chest,
      and drain your heart...

The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.
Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then
he throws money at the Attendant and leaves...

      we've narrowed it down to those
      cities within the seven-hour driving
      radius that also would've caught
      the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.

               GRAHAM
      What's it narrow down to?

               CRAWFORD(V.O.)
      Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria,
      Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati,
      Toledo and Detroit.

                GRAHAM
          (laughs )
      That's narrow?

               CRAWFORD (V.O.)
      When are you coming back?

               GRAHAM
      When I'm done.

Graham hangs up the phone. He looks out the window at the
rain. He dials again.

                GRAHAM
      It's Will Graham. Is Molly there,
      Mr. Swenson?

               GRAMPA (V.0.)
      Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?!
      You sure are in the center of a
      storm. Burning up lots of
      taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.
           (beat)
      On the news they said he was a white
      man. He isn't really, is he?

                GRAHAM
      Sure he is. Blond.
          (fuck him:)
      Probably Scandinavian, too...

                GRAMPA (V.O.)
      You going back down to Florida after?


               GRAHAM
      Yes. Is Molly there?











105.

               GRAMPA (V.O.)
      My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of
      breakfast every day. Been out
      riding. Must be the good air. You
      oughta see that little booger eat.
      I'11 bet he's gained ten pounds.
           (beat)
      Molly's out in the motor home...

               GRAHAM
      I know... 'Out in the good air...'

               GRAMPA (V.O.)
      What's that?

               GRAHAM
      Tell her I called.

Graham hangs up. He dials again.

               GPAHAM
      This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton
      arranged for me to talk with Dr.
      Lecktor .

               OPERATOR (V.O.)
      I'll put you through.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.
LECKTOR'S CELL - HANNIBAL LECKTOR - DAY

picks up the phone and takes Graham's call.

               LECXTOR
      I wanted to congratulate you for the
      job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired
      it enormously. What a cunning boy
      you are. Will.

               GRAHAM
      What do you want?

               LECKTOR
      You know Lounds's enlightened me on
      one thing: your confinement in the
      mental hospital. My attorney should
      have brought that our in court.

               GRAHAM
      I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of-
      bitches. If you've got something to
      say, Lecktor, say it.









106.

               LECKTOR
      I want to help you, Will. You'd be
      more comfortable if you relaxed with
      yourself. We don't invent our
      natures, They're issued to us.
      Along with our lungs and pancreas
      and everything else. Why fight it?

               GRAHAM
      Fight what?

               LECKTOR
      When you were so depressed after
      you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to
      death, it wasn't the act that got
      you down. Didn't you really feel
      so bad because killing him felt so
      good?
           (ironic)
      And why shouldn't it feel good?! It
      must feel good to God. God does it
      all the time!

Graham laughs. Then he starts to listen closely. There is
something here for him:

               GRAHAM
      I don't believe in God.

               LECKTOR
      You should, Will. God's terrific!
           (beat)
      He dropped a church roof on thirty-
      four of His worshippers in Texas last
      Wednesday night. Just as they were
      grovelling to Him and singing a hymn.
      Don't you think that felt good?
           (beat)
      He wouldn't begrudge you two measly
      murders.

               GRAHAM 
      Why does it feel good?

               LECKTOR
      It feels good because: if you do as
      God does, enough times, you become
      as God is: powerful...

Will Graham thinks about this.

               LECKTOR
           (fading)
      God's a champ! He got a hundred and
      sixty Philippines in one plane crash
      two months ago... Remember the big
      earthquake in Italy last spring...?







107.

Lecktor's voice fades as Will Graham hangs us on him. Graham
sits on the crumpled bed and stares out the window at the rain..

                            CUT TO:


INT. LEEDS HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY

stands in the kitchen. His raincoat and rainhat drip water
onto the floor. The house no longer is a crime scene. It's
been cleaned up. It is absolutely naked. Shades are drawn.
Slashes of light hit the floor. Graham stands there. Then
he walks forward...


STAIRCASE - GRAHAM'S FEET UP TIIE STAIRS

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      I enter. The glass cutter. I lick
      the suction cup. The piece of glass
      I take out is mine. House is mine .
           (beat)
      I walk up these stairs. I pass
      childrens' toys. The children mean
      nothing to me...

The toys appear on the stairs as Graham's feet continue
moving up the stairs to the second-floor landing.


GRAHAM'S POV: APPROACHING LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM DOOR

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      I am soundless. I move to the door.
      I step into the room...


INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM: THE DOOR

It opens. Graham enters.   The room is white. We don't see
the bed. Graham stands there in profile. Beyond Graham OUT
OF FOCUS the wall starts to discolor. Pieces of plaster
start to fall. The room starts to disintegrate around Graham.
We will see what Graham sees in his mind.

                CRAHAM
      I see you there. I breathe in the
      perfume of this room. I am in the
      inner sanctum of a life. You will
      accept me. Take me into you.


GRAHAM'S POV: THE BED


The ceiling and walls decomposing. Nothing falls on the bed.
Mr. Charles Leeds sleeps with his arm under Mrs. Leeds' pillow.







108.

Mrs. Leeds is on her side. Slowly she starts to rise. She
sees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream.
A silent shot shoves her back to the headboard. Red blood
starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound. We
FLOAT CLOSER. In SLOW MOTION Mr. Leeds starts to rise.
Something massive and silver flashes through the FRAME. He Is
gone. Mirrors explode. Mrs. Leeds was looking at her hand
covered with blood. Now Mrs. Leeds looks up at us. Her face
turns into a smile. Her eyes are silver. A silver light
emanates from her mouth. She smiles at us. She wants us. She
really wants us. Her hand gestures us closer. As we MOVE
CLOSER we hear:

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      You will be better than anything...
      anything I have ever known. As I
      see me in your eyes.., as I see me
      accepted there. Reflected there in
      mirrors .
           (beat)
      And you, you are the fuel for my
      changing... as this event becomes
      one more step towards what I am
      becoming that is different than what
      I have ever been before...
           (beat)
      As I see me, accepted by you, in the
      silver mirrors of your eyes...

In the silver mirrors of her eyes, Graham sees reflected
there: himself.


INT. LEEDS LIVING ROOM - WIDE

It is empty. The bare floorboards, a dynamic perspective of
lines, go nowhere. O.S. Graham's scream reverberates in the
empty house.
                            CUT TO:


INT. GATEWAY LABS, MAIN DARKROOM- WIDE FROM THE CEILING
DAY

It is pitch-black. In the green safe light we make our the
rollers and pulleys carrying film through the vats of D76
developer and fixer. It is mechanized. There is no one
to maintain it. Distantly on the floor in a far corner we
perceive the shape of a man and reddish glow. The CAMERA
STARTS MOVING towards the shape on the floor. As we get
closer we realize it's Dollarhyde. Something is wrong with
him. ..

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
      THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE
      THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.







109.

               DOLLARHYDE
      No.

                RED DRAGON (O.S.)

      THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF
      SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE
      A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE
      ME WHAT I WANT!

               DOLLARHYDE
      No!

By now we're close to his body curled up on the floor in the
sanctuary of the developing room. The red glow emanates
from beneath Dollarhyde's shirt.

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY
      PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH
      THEIR...

               DOLLARHYDE.
      Shut up. Stop. Stop it.

He stands.

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS!
      YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!

                DOLLARHYDE
      I want her! I want her alive...
      I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR
      ME!!!

He starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room.
They form a moire pattern of colors on walls. Some splash
on him and make his shirt smoke.


PHONE

Dollarhyde's unsteady hand takes it off the wall. Be pours
sweat. If the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him,
he doesn't acknowledge it. He punches four numbers.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Reba ...

               REBA (V.O.)
      Francis? Where are you?

               DOLLARHYDE
      The developing room.
           (beat)
      I need to... see you.







110.

                REBA (V.O.)
       I want to see you, too, Francis...
       Should I come over?

                DOLLARHYDE
           (into phone)
       No. Reba...?

                REBA (V.O.)
           (phone filter)
       Are you okay...?

               DOLLARHYDE
           (into phone; getting
           control)
       I'll see you later. All right?

                REBA (V.O.)
           (phone filter)
       You'll come by?

                DOLLARHYDE
           (into phone)
       Yes .

                            CUT TO:


EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - SLOW TRACK PAST DOLLARHYDE'S VAN -
NIGHT

He sits under the tree with the lights out. He is waiting.
Watching. He looks at his watch. Then he hears a car
approach and looks up.


DOLLARHYDE'S POV: GREEN OLDSMOBILE
pulls into Reba's drive.

INT. VAN - DOLLARHME'S FACE

Excited. He starts to get out. Now he stops.

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + RALPH DANDRIDGE

exit the Oldsmobile. He helps Reba out of the car. She
makes her own way up the sidewalk to her door. Reba opens
her door with a key. She turns towards Dandridge.

                DANDRIDGE
       There's something on your face.

He brushes at a speck of dust on Reba's cheek.











111.


INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE
stares. Events are threatening Dollarhyde's fragile stabil-
ity. We don't want this to be happening, we don't want
Dandridge to touch her...



DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DANDRIDGE

We see what Dollarhyde imagines: Dandridge's fingers caress
the soft skin of Reba's face. Reba's expression and mouth
are open and warm to him.


INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S FACE
Blank .

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DOLLARHYDE

Reba smiles. Her lips part. His finger brushes between her
lips... His hand goes to her breast...



INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S
hand clutches the dash.

PADDED DASH

His fingers pop through the vinyl, gouging deep furrows. We
hear hyperventilating.


EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - REBA + DANDRIDGE

Normal reality. There was no, there is no seduction. No
contact.

               REBA
      What was it?

               DANDRIDGE
      Pollen .

               REBA
      Thanks for the ride.

               DANDRIDGE
      See you tomorrow.

Reba walks into her apartment












112.
RALPH DANDRIDGE
walks back to his car. We are TRACKING WITH Dandridge walk-
ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge.
Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower
face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge's
face. THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter.
He shot Dandridge three times in the heart.



                            CUT TO:


INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - REBA - NIGHT

Moving in the dark. The DOORBELL RINGS. She has unbuttoned
her blouse. Now she goes back to answer the door.

               REBA
      Who is it?

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      It's me.

               REBA
      Who?

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Me.

               REBA
      Francis.. .?

She opens the door and smiles.

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      It's not Francis?
           (beat)
      No. Francis is gone. Francis is
      gone forever...

As he steps towards her...


                            CUT TO:


THE MOON

It's full and very large as it dawns over black water that
seems to ripple and be drawn to it. PULL BACK to reveal
we are:


INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - WINDOW + NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

Next to the window we see the Jacobi family in fishing
scene on a monitor. They are on a pier into a small lake
with poles and bobbers. The kids turn back and wave AT us.






113.


               CRAWFORD (O.S.)
           What's important?

The scene changes to a birthday party. The Jacobis are
sitting around a dining table. They are singing.



GRAHAM + CRAWFORD


                GRAHAM
      He changes them into beings that
      accept him... And he needs to see
      the acceptance, In the mirrors.
      I didn't understand the mirrors
      before.
           (beat)
      It's very important.

               CRAWFORD
      'Changes?'

                GRAHAM
      It's a word. Killing them...
           (beat)
      His delusion is: if he sees
      himself accepted enough times, he
      will become as one who has the
      power to be accepted all the time.
           (beat)
      And he would record it somehow. So
      he can see himself received over
      and over again...

                CRAWFORD
      VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

               GRAHAM
      How do I know?!


Graham is intent on the tape. Then:


                GRAHAM
      He's very careful, very... designed
      when he chooses,
           (beat )
      If we find out how he finds them,
      then we'll find him.

                CRAWFORD
      There's no connection between the
      families.

               GRAHAM
      There has to be.





114.


                CRAWFORD
           (exasperated)
      There is none! We've run it
      through the computer a dozen
      times .

Graham's beyond frustration.

                GRAHAM
          (suddenly calm)
      He's a very shy boy...

               CRAWFORD
      What?

               GRAHAM
      Something Lecktor said.

                CRAWFORD
      Let's admit we struck out this
      month. The Gulf Stream's standing
      by. The basic lab stuff is on it.
      You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a
      photographer. Anywhere he hits,
      we can be there in an hour and
      fifteen minutes. We get the call,
      we roll. The scene'll be very
      fresh. ..

               GRAHAM
      It's not over yet.

                CRAWFORD
      It's a foregone conclusion. For
      Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.
      The full moon is tonight.

Graham doesn't answer. He's totally concentrated on the
film.



TV MONITOR: JACOBI FAMILY

Donald Jacobi, big birthday card to the camera. It says:
"Happy Birthday - Follow the ribbon." Camera follows Donald
Jacobi following the ribbon into the basement and the flood-
lights reveal a ten-speed bicycle.

               CRAWFORD
      Will?

                GRAHAM
           (explodes )
      You wanna watch this or what?!

Crawford stares at him. Then he works his way through a
report with a penlight.





115.

TV MONITOR: JACOBI FAMILY

We are outside in the rain. Donald Jacobi brings the bicycle
out. The camera pans past: the padlock on the basement door.
Graham's hand flashes INTO FRAME and slams on the freeze
button.


               GRAHAM
      That's why the boltcutter.

               CRAWFORD
      What's that?

                GRAHAM
      He used a boltcutter to trim the
      branch out of his way. When he
      was watching from the woods. Why
      didn't he use it to go through the
      basement door?

                CRAWFORD
      Because a steel door and deadbolt
      were there when they were killed.

                GRAHAM
      You mean Jacobi put it in between
      when this film was made and when
      he was murdered?

               CRAWFORD
      He had to.


Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy
report on Donald Jacobi.


                GRAHAM
      Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday
      party was April fourteenth.
      Sometime between April fourteenth
      and May third they changed the
      door.
           (beat)
      But you can't see either family's
      door from the street. He wouldn't
      know until he got to the house that
      the padlock wasn't there anymore...


He freezes the Jacobi tape and loads and plays the Leeds
tape :


                GRAHAM
           (intently on the screen )
      From the alley he couldn't have
      seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen
      door .
                (MORE)



116.


               GRAHAM (CONT'D)
      There's a lattice porch back there,
      but he was ready with his glasscutter.
           (beat)
      So he was either casing far ahead and
      we didn't check back far enough or...


MONITOR: LEEDS TAPE

The Leeds' gray Scottie perks up his ears and runs in the
glass kitchen door. The camera pans off the dog to Valerie
Leeds coming in the door: behind her the door is vulnerable
with its big glass pane. Her kids follow her through the
door...

               CRAWFORD
      It's getting late and...

                GRAHAM
          (explodes)
      Don't talk to me!!

Crawford's surprised.



EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM


Watching. Then he grabs the phone and punches numbers.

                GRAHAM
      It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is
      still in the storeroom?

               METCALPE (V.O.)
      Yeah. You know what time it is?

                GRAHAM
      Have one of the guards down there
      call me.

               METCALFE (V.O.)
      If the guy's not asleep...

               GRAHAM
      Do it.

He hangs up on Metcalfe.



VTR MONITORS


Graham's hand freezes the Leeds' rape and plays the Jacobi
tape. The Jacobis' cat moves, jumps on the table.





117.


                       GRAHAM
           (to himself)
      You knew that was the Jacobis'
      cat ...

The Jacobi boy pushes the bicycle out of the basement door
with the padlock.

                GRAHAM
           (to himself)
      You brought a boltcutter... 'cause
      you thought there was a padlock...

Next Mrs. 3acobi -- warm, smiling -- watches Donald ride
the bike. Now Graham plays the Leeds' tape, too. The dog
runs to camera...


                GRAHAM
           (to himself)
      And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a
      collar... But you know it's the
      Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!

His tail wagging, his tongue out; he's a friendly dog. Mrs.
Leeds enters and pets him.

                GRAHAM
          (to himself)
      See the woman?

Crawford is staring at Graham strangely. This is why
Crawford drafted him. But Crawford doesn't look like he
wants to be alone in the same room with Graham anymore...

                GRAHAM
      The bloom on the woman. You can
      almost feel her.  You can see her
      again and again. Anytime you want.
           (beat)
      The doggy doesn't have a collar.
      But you know the Leeds' dog, don't
      you?
           (beat)
      And you know the Jacobi cat. And
      the padlock on the door and you
      know you need a boltcutter and
      every other goddamn thing 'cause...
           (shouts)
      YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS!
           (beat)
      Haven't you, my man?


The PHONE RINGS. Crawford answers. His attention is riveted
on Graham.


                CRAWFORD
      It's the guard in the storeroom.



118.


                GRAHAM
           (to Crawford)
      We want the cans the Jacobi home
      movies came in.
           (beat)
      They're in the far corner of the
      room under the windows.

                CRAWFORD
           (into phone)
      There's some film cans in the far
      corner of the room underneath one
      of the windows.


Crawford is very quiet.


               CRAWFORD
      He found them...


Graham pushes aside the videotape sleeve and picks up the
Leeds' home-movie can.


                GRAHAM
           (reads label)
      What it's going to say on the
      Jacobi film can is the same as it
      says on the Leeds' film can:
      Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.

                CRAWFORD
           (into phone)
      Is there a label on the Jacobi can
      that says what lab processed it?


Crawford hears. Then he deflates.


                CRAWFORD
           (to Graham)
      No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...

                GRAHAM 
      Have him peel the top label back.

                CRAWPORD
           (into phone)
      See if there's another label
      underneath.

Crawford hears, Graham's watching him.

               GRAHAM
      It does, doesn't it?





119.


               CRAWFORD
           (punches another
           number)
      I want a chopper on the roof in
      three minutes. To Meigs Field.
           (bear )
      At Meigs have them warn up and
      flight-prep the Gulf Stream.

Graham's already out the door. Crawford races after him.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - REBA - NIGHT

has been placed on the kitchen table. It is chrome and
pale yellow Formica. Her face is bruised and swollen from
where Dollarhyde hit her. She feels, around on the bed.
She's very frightened. She's trying to control herself...

               REBA
      ... You're scaring me with this.

There's no answer. We don't know if there's anyone else in
the room.

               REBA
           (searching).
      Am I alone in this room? Are you
      here...
           (shrill)
      Why are you doing this?!

      Some remarkable events have
      happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.
      Do you know what I'm talking about?


Reba shakes her head.


               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (in a low voice)
      Two groups of people were changed.
      Leeds. And Jacobi. The police
      think they were murdered.
           (beat)
      Do you know what they call the
      being that visited these people?
      You can say.

               REBA
      The Tooth...

In a flash Dollarhyde grips her mouth, shutting off the
sound.





120.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (low)
      Think carefully and answer
      correctly.

His arm exits FRAME.

               REBA
      It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Francis did a thing for you today
      so I couldn't have you. And he
      was wrong.
           (beat)
      I AM THE DRAGON!
          (beat)
      Give me your hand.


Reba's hand is gripped by Dollarhyde's. He brings her
fingers up to his face. For the first time in this scene
we are seeing Dollarhyde's face. The fanged dentures are
in his mouth. Dollarhyde makes Reba's hand feel his teeth.
O.S., we hear Reba start whimpering and try to pull away.
Dollarhyde holds her hand there.


               DOLLARHYDE
      Now you know how the Dragon
      kills...

She stands there, squeezing into the corner, trying to make
herself disappear. Then she senses and freezes as a rabbit
who is hunted and at a certain point, freezes...


DOLLARHYDE

stands four feet from her, just staring. Then he walks
from the room.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S LIVING ROOM - DOLLARHYDE

puts "INNAGADDADAVIDA" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the

Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened.

smashes. His image SHATTERS with the mirrored glass.



DOLLARHYDE'S

forearm destroys the glass shower door. He rips the metal
frame from the walls. He snaps the mitred framework. The
aluminum frame members have sharp 45 degree points. He
takes them and the shards of mirror and leaves for the

      Go on to the house...

He obeys Graham and floors it. Graham puts his black plastic
briefcase on his lap and extracts the .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
He starts to load 6 matte-black, blunt-nosed Glaser Safety
Slugs. He fumbles them in the swaying car. The bullets
fall to the floor.


CAR FLOOR

Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting. Graham's
fingers enter and pick them up. We FOLLOW the rounds as
they slip into the cylinder.


CRAWFORD
is staring at Graham's blankness.

      Will?

               GRAHAM
          (sharp )
      What?

               CRAWFORD
      You're not going to need that.

We don't know why they are slowing down.

slap at them. Ahead, the orchard will parallel the house.
They can get to within 25 yards using the trees as cover.

           (into radio)
      Get the roadblocks set on Route
      Three! There's an access road to
      the back of the house. That ought
      to be a second team's approach.
      Will Graham and I are in an orchard
      due west of the house.

                GRAHAM
      How far away's the back-up?

               CRAWFORD
      Three minutes.

Graham gestures Crawford to a position with a front 3/4 view
of the house.

               GRAHAM
      I'll cover the back.

               CRAWFORD
      Stay in the trees.


As we TRACK with Graham through the trees towards the back,
beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving
past. The windows are large. At the back -- like a ramp --
are two storm cellar doors.

FRONTAL: GRAHAM

in the dark shadows of the trees. He seems to float: through
the branches and slows and settles quietly. Then the ex-
pression on Will Graham's face starts to change...

Shadows. A light comes on. Then the figure of Reba is
swung out of a corner past the window...

On the right we see Dollarhyde's right arm with the aluminum
shafts... Beyond them, THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Graham has
stepped out from the tree line. He stands on the grass.
He looks helpless. His gun hangs idly at his side.


CLOSE: GRAHAM

It's his worst nightmare. About what he's seeing:

          (low)
      ... stop it.


INT. DOLLARHME'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + BEYOND HIM 007 THE

We and Graham see Dollarhyde's arm arc back for an uppercutting
thrust into Reba. Dollarhyde's left hand clutching her dress,
raises her two feet up the wall. And now Graham starts running
forward. And his face is distorted and he's shouting:


                GRAHAM
           (roars)
      STOP IT!!!

Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see:




128.


WINDOW + GRAHAM
-- his arms across his face and his body angled sideways
-- CRASHES through the glass.


DOLLARHYDE

catching Graham's momentum -- throws him across the room.

GRAHAM

CRASHES off the fridge which opens and spills and hits the
floor as...

DOLLARHYDE

ROARS and grabs his 9mm from the kitchen table.


GRAHAM'S FACE

is lacerated from the glass. He sees his own blood on the
floor. He struggles to rise. The first thing up is the
big bore of the .44. It FIRES as if it had its own mind.


DOLLARHYDE'S

left shoulder EXPLODES.


GRAHAM

bleeding, brings the .44 down from the recoil of the first shot.
Now, up on one knee, he FIRES FOUR more rounds into Dollarhyde.



OVERHEAD: THE KITCHEN FLOOR


Graham stands and walks to Dollarhyde. Reba is collapsed in
the corner. Dollarhyde it more exploded from within than
shot. Graham starts to raise the gun...

      I was out in the garden. Mama came
      out and told me when she saw it on
      TV. Why didn't you call me?

               GRAHAM
      Mama was probably asleep.

               MOLLY
      Will? Are you okay?

               GRAHAM
      Not too bad. I'll be here a few
      days longer.
           (beat)
      I want to see you.

               MOLLY
      I want to see you, too.

      Today's Wednesday. By Friday I
      ought to...

               MOLLY
      Mama has all Kevin's uncles and
      aunts coming down from Cheyenne
      next week and...

               GRAHAM
      Come home with me.

               MOLLY
      Will, they never get to see Kevin
      and a few more days...

               GRAHAM
      What's this Mama shit?

               MOLLY
      It's what Kevin called her when he
      was little...

               GRAHAM
      What's the problem, Molly?

               MOLLY

      I came up here after Kevin's father
      died .
           (beat)
      They were very supportive and
      helped me adjust. I got myself
      together. I've gotten myself
      together now, too.

      Small difference: I'm not dead,
      yet .

               MOLLY
      Will?
          (no response)
      You could come up here.

               GRAHAM
      They don't want me up there. Every
      time they look at me I remind them...
      If they thought about it, they'd
      want you. Bur all they really want's
      the boy. And they'll take you.
      But they don't want to see me...

               MOLLY
      That's not true.

               GRAHAM
      Okay. They're full of shit and
      they make me sick...

Then no one says anything.

               MOLLY
      Maybe we should give it some time...

               GRAHAM
      Yeah. That's great. A little
      time.
           (beat
      I tell you what, buckaroo...
           (beat)
      See you around.


Graham slams down the phone. Still half-immersed in a
psychotic landscape of the mind, Graham's psyche resonates
with echoes of Dollarhyde. Now he gets up and walks out of

INT. TAXI (TULSA, OKLAHOMA) - PASSENGER'S POV OF DRIVER - NIGHT


It's raining The DRIVER moves slowly down a residential
street looking for an address. He squints...

      Twenty-three twenty-six..- Twenty-
      three twenty-eight. Here you go.
      
      (pulls up to curb )

      Want me to wait?

      Yes .

INT. HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT


It's open plan. The dining area and kitchen are raised.
The Sherman family are engaged in 7:00 PM suburban family
chaos: GEORGE SHERMAN is trying to watch the news. He
hollers up the stairs for his daughter to turn down her
stereo. His 11-year-old son, FRED, at the dining room
table is supposed to be doing homework. Instead he rolls
up balls of paper and does jump shots from his chair into
the wastepaper can,

      Cut out the basketball and go back

George Sherman goes back to NBC news. The DOORBELL RINGS.
Thirteen-year-old TINA SHERMAN comes down the stairs.

      I'll get it.

Tina opens it.

TINA

screams.

GEORGE SHEBMAN

runs to the door. In a WIDER SHOT, we see there is a sho-
gun resting inside the door jamb. It's within reach or
Sherman's hand. We see why Tina Sherman screamed:

WILL GRAHAM'S FACE

is pulled down slightly on the left side, making his left
eye moon-shaped. There is a half-healed wound and butter-
fly bandage where Dollarhyde stabbed him. He is standing
in a black raincoat with a black hat.


               SHERMAN
      What do you want?

               GRAHAM
      Are you George Sherman?

               SHERMAN
      Yes. Who are you?

                GRAHAEI
      My name's Will Graham. I...

               SXERMAN

            who he is)
      Oh, Jesus... Come in.
           (to wife)
      Honey...!


His wife starts to come forward.


               GRAHAM
      No, that's okay...
           (pause)
      How are you?

There's a searching look on Graham's face. Totally strange.


                SHERMAN
      We're fine. Fine. We're all well.
      We're okay!
           (beat)
      That man, Crawford, called and...
      told me...
           (beat)
      ... how 'bout a drink? Coffee or
      something?

                GRAHAM
      No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...
           (beat)
      ... stop by and...

                SHERMAN
      I can't thank you enough, I..,

Graham shakes his head. He doesn't want to be thanked.
No one knows what to say. Graham looks at them:




133.
SHERMAN FAMILY
standing in awkward places. They ate nothing special. They
are normal human beings living their lives. To Graham they
are very special: they are alive.


                GRAHAM
      I just wanted to stop by and... see
      you... I guess. That's all.


Graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory.
Then he nods. Then he leaves.


GEORGE SHERMAN

closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He
didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.

stands as she comes near him. The aqua highlights of the
water eat into their figures as they look at each other.
Molly touches the wounded side of his face. Then:

               MOLLY
      Let's forget who said what to whom...

               GRAHAM
      You got a deal...

Graham takes Molly's hand.

WATER'S EDGE

Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea.
The highlights burn out sections of the two people.

               MOLLY
      So how'd we do...?

Graham looks at her. He touches the side of her cheek and
her hair. She pushes against his hand with her face to make
closer contact.

               GRAHAM
      We did okay.

Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm
across Molly's shoulder. Molly's arm moves around Graham's
waist. They look out to sea. In front of them, the surf
kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant
atoms.

EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY


The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men
imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK
CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.
His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white
sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late
thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-
let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from
a glass of iced tea. Then:

                          CRAWFORD
           I should have caught you at the boat
           yard when you got off work. You
           don't want to talk about it here...

                          GRAHAM
           I don't want to talk about it
           anywhere.
                   (beat)
           If you brought pictures, leave them
           in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin
           will be back soon.

                          CRAWFORD
           How much do you know?

                          GRAHAM
           What was in the 'Miami Herald' and
           the 'Times.'

           Confessions?

                          CRAWFORD
           Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He
           smashes the mirrors and uses the
           pieces.
                   (beat)
           None of them knew that;

                          GRAHAM
           What else did you keep out of the
           papers?

                          CRAWFORD
           Blond, right-handed, really strong,
           wears a size eleven shoe. The prints
           are all smooth gloves. He's on a
           full moon cycle. Both times. His
           blood is AB Positive.

                          GRAHAM
           Somebody hurt him?

                          CRAWFORD
           Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.

Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham.

Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.
                           CRAWFORD
           Will... you saw this in the papers.
           The second one was all over TV. Did
           you ever think about givin' me a
           call?

                          GRAHAM
           No.

                           CRAWFORD
           Why not?

                           GRAHAM
           The Bureau already has the best lab.
           Plus you have Bloom at the University
           of Chicago...

                           CRAWFORD
           And I got you down here fixing fuckin'
           boat motors.

                           GRAHAM
           You don't need me. I wouldn't
           be useful to you anymore, Jack.

                           CRAWFORD
           Last two like this we had, you
           caught.

                           GRAHAM
           That was three years ago. And by
           doing the same things you and the
           rest of them at the lab are doing.

                           CRAWFORD
           That's not entirely true, Will.
           It's the way you think.


                           GRAHAM
           I think there has been a lot of
           bullshit about the way I think.
                   (beat)
           I came down here to get away from
           all that.

                          CRAWFORD
           You look all right now.

                          GRAHAM
           I am all right.

Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps
them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.




3.
                            CRAWFORD
            If you can't look anymore, I
            understand...

                            GRAHAM
            As long as they're dead...

                           CRAWFORD
            These are all dead, Will.


 PICTURES

 If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two
 snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck
 carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family
 behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.


 CLOSE: GRAHAM

 looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he
 puts them down and looks along the beach.


 GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN

 KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the
 water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.
 MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands
 watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen
 around her ankles. Her body language openly states
 hostility. It's towards Crawford.

                           GRAHAM (O.S.)
            Let's talk after dinner. Stay and
            eat.


                            CRAWFORD (O.S.)

            before he came out here.

            What did he want?

                                 MOLLY
                 He asked how you are.

                 And you said?

                                 MOLLY
                 I said you are fine, he should leave
                 you the hell alone.

                                 GRAHAM
                 I'm a forensic specialist, Molly.
                 You've seen my diploma?
                          (sarcastic)
                 I got a diploma and everything.

                                 MOLLY
                 You mended a crack in the wallpaper
                 with your diploma.
                          (heat)
                 You are open and easy now... It took

                 We have it good, don't we?

                 All the things that happened to you
                 before make you know that...

      There is a soft pleading in her voice.

                 not really asking.

                                GRAHAM

 house feels occupied. The Leed's possessions have been
 undisturbed.


 CLOSE: GLASS DOOR

 We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham
 enters. It's like he's a burglar.


 GRAHAM'S FEET

 walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going.
 A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly.
 Graham's feet pass our of frame...


 INT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR

 is empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps
 up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash-
 light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark
 stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master
 bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing.


 INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH
 Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch.

 BLOOD

 screams at us from the walls.

WIDER - GRAHAM
moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half
the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The
mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi-
cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the
file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports.


OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM

standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The
crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial
blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or
bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic.
Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his
own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference.

                           GRAHAM
           intruder entered through kitchen
           sliding door. Probably a glass
           cutter. Why didn't he care that he
           left AB saliva on the glass? it was
           hot out that night. inside, the
           house must' have been pleasantly cool
           to him.
                   (beat)
           The intruder cut Charles Leeds'
           throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs.
           Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was
           rising... Bullet entered the right of
           her navel and lodged in her lumbar
           spine, but she died of strangulation...
           increase of serotonin and free
           histimine levels in the gunshot wound
           indicates... she lived at least five
           minutes after she was shot... All
           her other injuries were post-mortem.
                   (beat>
           Then he went toward the children's
           room.
                   (beat)
           Direction and velocity of blood
           stains on the east wall indicate
           arterial spray.;. With his throat
           cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight.
           Because the intruder was moving to
           the children's room...
                   (beat)
           in the children's room the intruder
           shot the first boy in bed. Second
           boy was found in bed, but dustballs
           indicate he was dragged out from
           under his bed to be shot...

           unexplained... as does superficial
	      ligature mark around Mr. Leed's
           chest, believed to be post-mortem.
           What did the killer do with them
           after they were dead? And before
           he put the boys back in their beds?

He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on
the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the
faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be
is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees...


ZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE

still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham
is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom.
He doesn't let it unnerve him.

EXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT

The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and
sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed
reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond
him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant...
More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid
meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image.
He takes out his tape recorder again.

                         GRAHAM
           There's a wicker dog bed on the back
           porch. There's a doghouse in the
           back yard. Where's the dog?

snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2.


CONVENTIONEER #2

sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles:


                           CONVENTIONEER #1
           What the fuck are you lookin' at?

Graham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens.

ZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT

We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home
movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while
the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next
to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All
are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth-
day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath
her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's
smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds
runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his
wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He
looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to
the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy
blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera
a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A
big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.
11.

The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to
follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise.


GRAHAM

has hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch
of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in
outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial
splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs.
Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat-
tress.

                           GRAHAM
                   (into the tape
                   recorder)
           When they were dead -- except
           possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed
           the mirrors and began selecting
           shards that he used later on Mrs.
           Leeds... What did he do in the
           interval? Struggling with Mr.
           Leeds and killing the others would
           take less than a minute. What
           else?
                   (beat)
           Three bloodstains on the east wall,
           not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray.
           What did killer do after they were
           dead?

Graham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks
up the phone and dials. He waits. Then:

                           GRAHAM
                   (into phone)
           Molly?

                   (asleep)
           Huh?
                   (beat)
           Will? Is that you?

                           GRAHAM
           It's me. I'll call you tomorrow,
           sweetheart. Go back to sleep.
                   (beat)
           I love you...

                          MOLLY (V.O.)
           Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will.
           Good night.

Will hangs up the phone. He reaches over and punches "Play"
on the VTR.


12.

WIDE SHOT: THE ROOM - GRAHAM
VTR backs up, starts to play and we see the image of Mrs.
Leeds again in the home movie: they follow the yellow rib-
bon down the stairs to a bicycle. It's indoors. It's rain-
ing outside. The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic.
Mrs. Leeds smiles.

                           GRAHAM
                   (into tape recorder)
           You moved the kids after you killed
           them, didn't you? Did you arrange
           them for your performance with Mrs.
           Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr.
           Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the
           postmortem ligature on his chest.
           Did you make them your audience?
           Did you open their eyes? There is
           something you can't afford for me
           to know about. Isn't there? Mrs.
           Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was
           maddening to have to wear gloves when
           you touched her, wasn't it?
                   (beat)
           There was talcum powder on her leg.
           There was no talcum powder in the
           bathroom.
                   (beat)
           The powder they found came out of a
           rubber glove as you pulled it off

           to touch her. You took off your
           glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU,
           YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH?! You touched
           her with your bare hands! And then
           you put the gloves back an. And
           you wiped her down! While your
           gloves were off?
                   (shouts)
           DID YOU OPEN THEIR EYES? THEIR DEAD
           EYES?!


FAST MOVEMENTS: GRAHAM'S HAND

snakes out and hits the "Stop" button on the VTR.


PHONE


is picked up and we MOVE WITH IT to his face. Graham punches
numbers into the phone. He waits. He clamps dawn again.

He is cold, calm.

                           GRAHAM
           Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still

            Get him to Atlanta.

                            CRAWFORD (V.O.)
            You said the guy down here is good.

                            GRAHAM
            He is good. Bur not as good as Price.


                            CRAWFORD (V.O.)
            What do you want to do?


                            GRAHAM
            Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails.
            I think he took off his gloves, Jack.
                   (heat)
            And dust all the corneas of all their

            Our people swear he wore surgeons'
            gloves the whole time. They dusted
            everything.

                            GRAHAM
            The report didn't mention nails and
            eyes.

                            SPRINGFIELD
            Why do you think he took his gloves
            off?

                            GRAHAM
            Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman.
            I'd want to touch her skin in an
            intimate situation, wouldn't you?

                            SPRINGFIELD
                   (sudden distaste)
            'Intimate? !"

                            GRAHAM
            Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.

            Everybody else was dead.

Springfield looks at Graham. Springfield needs answers, not
voodoo. Then they enter the squad room. Twenty detectives
sit at desks. Graham and Crawford move to the back of the
class.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           All right. House to house interviews
           will be extended four additional
           blocks. R & I has loaned us two
           clerks to help cross-matching airline
           reservations between Birmingham last

           Dr. Princi.

DR. DOMINIQUE PRINCI, Chief Medical Examiner for Fulton
County, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of
teeth. He hold's up a dental cast.

                           DR. PRINCI
           This is what the subject's teeth
           look like. The Smithsonian in
           Washington reconstructed them from
           the impressions we took of bite
           marks off the Leeds woman here and
           off the Jacobi woman last month in
           Birmingham.
                   (beat)
	     As you can see, he has pegged lateral
           incisors -- the teeth here and here.

The teeth look like teeth from a small bear.

                          SPRINGFIELD
           Investigator Graham has worked this
           kind of thing before. Can you add
           anything?

Graham doesn't like talking in public. He stutters and
starts to say something...

                           SPRINGFIELD
           Can't hear you. Can you come up to
           the front?

Graham walks to the front of the room.

                           GRAHAM
           He may have a history of biting --
           barroom fights or child abuse.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           He only bit women so far, right?

                          GRAHAM

          Most of the time in sex assaults the
          bite mark has a livid spot in the
          center. A suck mark. These don't.
          So, for him, biting may be a fighting
          pattern as much as sexual behavior.

                          GRAHAM
          Sex murder: three. He likes to
          bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.

          Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...

Graham sits down.

          Marcus and Whitman heads up at the
          funeral. The rest of you, your

          go.

They start to rise. Springfield remembers.

                          SPRINGFIELD
          One more thing: I've heard officers
          referring to the killer as the 'Tooth
          Fairy.
                   (on laughter)
          Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear
          that in public or internal memoranda.
          That's it.

Detectives file out. Crawford and Graham remain.
Springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other
detectives to leave.

                          SPRINGFIELD
                   (to Crawford)
          We don't have shit, and we know it.

Dr. Princi joins them.

           The Commissioner was saying you
           were the one that caught Dr. Lecter
           three years ago.
                   (beat)
           He killed nine people, didn't he?

                           GRAHAM
           Nine that we know of. Two didn't
           die.

                          SPRINGFIELD
           What happened to them?

                           GRAHAM
           One's on the respirator at a hospital
           in Baltimore. The other is in a
           private mental hospital in Denver.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           What did the psychologists say was
           wrong with Lecter?

                          GRAHAM
           Psychologists call him a sociopath.
           They don't know what else to call
           him.

                           SPRINGFIELD
           What would you call him?

Graham doesn't answer.

                          SPRINGFIELD
           To yourself...

                          GRAHAM
           I call him a monster.

                           SPRINGFIELD

                           SPRINGFIELD
           It's at the vet's. The kids brought
           it in with a puncture wound in the
           abdomen. icepick or an awl.

                           GRAHAM
           Was the dog wearing a collar with

                          GRAHAM
          Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have
          a dog?

                          CRAWFORD
                   (alert)
          A cat. We found a litter box
          downstairs but not the cat.
          Neighbors are watching for it.

                          GRAHAM
          Why don't you get Birmingham P.D.
          a methane probe out of D.C. and
          have them cover the backyard...
          maybe the cat's dead and the kids
          buried it.

Crawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield
answers.
                          SPRINGFIELD
          Yeah?
                   (waits)
Lemme put you on the speaker phone.

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          Who am I talking to?

                          CRAWIIORD
          Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and
          you got Will Graham here.

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          I got a partial with a tented arch
          that's probably a thumb print and
          a fragment of a palm.

Springfield reacts.

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          Came off the oldest kid's left eye.
          It stood out against an eight-ball
          hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.

                          CRAWFORD
          Can you make an identification off
          it?

                         JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.)
          Don't know. The palm came off the
          nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
          I want to work these up in my own
          darkroom. I'll fax the prints down
          to you this afternoon.
Hangs up.



18.
SPRINGFIELD
thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very
changed.


GRAHAM

senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank.
He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches
Graham all the way to the door.

                                                 CUT TO:


EXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY

coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield,
the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No-
body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who
separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is
LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them.

                           LOUNDS
           Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie
           Lounds? I covered the Lecter
           case for the Tattler. I did the
           paperback... !


CLOSE: GRAHAM

walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel
trap. He's repressing something powerful.

                           LOUNDS
                   (running on, behind
                   them)
           When did they call you in, Will?
           What have you got?

Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now.

                          CRAWFORD
           Lounds, give it a rest...

                           LOUNDS
           Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!

Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford
tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:

                           LOUNDS
           How does this guy compare with
           Lecter? How does he do them?

Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to
turn him around.


19.

 GRAHAM

 Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under
 him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The
 impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The
 violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from
 Lounds.


                            GRAHAM
                    (very low)
            Keep the fuck away from me!

 Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham
 lets go.


 WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY

 down the sidewalk and Lounds who slides off the car hood and
 lands on all fours.

                            CRAWFORD
                    (over his shoulder
                    to Lounds)
            Get the hell away from here, Lounds!

 INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY
 Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee.
 Crawford is looking at him. Finally:

                            GRAHAM
            ...snuck in the hospital while I
            was sedated, flipped back the sheets
            and shot pictures. The only decent
            thing he did was run a black square
            over my balls...

                           CRAWFORD
            I know...

 Graham looks away. Then he lights another cigarette.

                            GRAHAM
                    (back to business)
            Atlanta and Birmingham can run
            the thumb print against known sex
            offenders. Five will get you
            ten they don't come up with an

            printed and in his Index.






20.

               		CRAWFORD
Say we've arrested a good suspect.
You walk in and see him. What
is there about him that doesn't
surprise you?

               GRAHAM
I don't know, Jack. He's got no
face for me.

               CRAWFORD
You can tell something about him
or we wouldn't have found the finger
print. ..

               GRAHAM.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack,
all right?
        (pause)
We'll get him one way or the other.

               CRAWFORD
What's one way?

               GRAHAM
We find an event that connects both
families. Same vacation hotel; same
hospital, different times. Then we
check employees and come up with a
male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...
        (beat)
If we find out how he found them,
then we'll find him.

		  CRAWFORD
We're running it through the
computers now. So far there's no
event or service that doubles back
into both families. Plus they were
big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing
trips, scuba, videogames, lots of
routine medical and dental. It's
a haystack.
        (beat)
What's the other?

               GRAHAM
He makes noise going in and the
husband gets to a gun in time.

               CRAWFORD
No other possibilities?

               GRAHAM
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across
a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza
you're thinking about.

         The Tooth Fairy will go on until we
         get smart or get lucky. He won't
         stop.

                     CRAWFORD
         Why?

                      GRAHAM
         Because he has a genuine taste for
         it, Jack.

                      CRAWFORD
         See? You do know something about
         him.

                      GRAHAM
                (long stare at
                Crawford; then)
         ... I'm going to see Lecter.

Crawford's cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth:

                     CRAWFORD
         For Christ's sake, why?

                      GRAHAM
               (matter-of-fact)
         To recover the mind set.

         Me, too. And very erotic...

                     GRAHAM
         Tell me about yourself.

         Which part? That or the day-to-day.

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
        Kevin's fine. He had to recover the
        turtle eggs you two fenced in. The
        dogs dug them up. Tell me what
        you're doing.

        Eating junk food.
               (beat)
        They don't have a lock on anything,
        Molly. There's not enough
        information. Or I haven't done
        enough with it...

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
        Will you be in Atlanta for a while?
        I'm not buggin' you about coming
        home, I just wondered.

                     GRAHAM
        Z don't know. I'm goin' up to
        Baltimore this afternoon.

                    MOLLY (V.O.)
        To do what?

                    GRAHAM
        I have to see somebody.

There is a silence. Graham does not want to tell her that
he is going to see Lecter. Molly stays cool, she doesn't

pursue it.

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
        I'm thinking about painting the
        kitchen. What color do you like,
        Will? Are you there?

                     GRAHAM
               (coming back)
        Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it
        yellow.

                    MOLLY (V.O.)
        Yellow's a bad color for me. I'LL
        look green at breakfast.

                    GRAHAM
        Blue, then.

                    MOLLY (V.O.)

         Look, I'm sorry. When I come home,
         we'll go to the paint store together

Molly interrupts:

                     MOLLY (V.O.)
         Will, I don't know why I'm talking
         about this stuff...
               (beat)
         I called to tell you: I love you
         and I miss you. And you are doing
         the right thing. It's costing
         you, too. And I know that. And
         I'm here. I'LL be here whenever
         you come home. Or I'LL meet you
         anywhere.  Anytime. That's what I
         called to say...

Graham holds the phone close to him. As if it were a part of
Molly herself.

                     GRAHAM
         Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now,
         baby. ..

WIDE SHOT: GRAHAM

slowly hangs up the phone. He sits, round-shouldered, on

closets, videotapes and files: the mess of being only half-
packed.

INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE
DR. CHILTON - DAY

                     DR. CHILTON
         Dr. Bloom called me yesterday, Mr.
         Graham. Or should I call you Dr.
         Graham?

                     GRAHAM (O.S.)
         I'm not a doctor.
               (beat)
         I need to see Lecter in as much
         privacy as possible.
24.
 TWO SHOT
 Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. He appears
 repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere Chief of
 Staff, but not gifted.

                      DR. CHILTON
         Dr. Lecter will stay in his room.
         That is absolutely the only place
         where he is not put in full body
         restraints. One wall of his room
         is a double barrier. I will have
         a chair put just outside.

                      GRAHAM
         I might have to show him some
         material that could stimulate him.

                      DR. CHILTON
         As long as it's on soft paper.
         You may(Pause) find this curious.

 He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the
 spiky lines.

                      DR. CHILTON
         Here Lecter's resting on the
         examining table getting an
         electrocardiogram. Complained of
         chest pains. Pulse seventy-two.
         Here he grabs the nurse's head and
         pulls her down to him. Here he's
         subdued by the attendant and
         Lecter's shoulder is dislocated.
         Do you notice the strange thing?
                 (pause)
         His pulse never got over eighty-
         five. Even when he tore into her
         face.

 Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a.
 response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is
 a blank.

                      DR. CHILTON
         The consensus around here is that
         the only person who has demonstrated
         any practical understanding of Dr.
         Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham.
         Can you tell me anything about him?

                     GRAHAM
         No.







25 .

                      DR. CHILTON
         When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders,
         their 'style,' so to speak, were you
         able to reconstruct his fantasies?
         And did that help you identify him?


DR. CHILTON

looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility.
Right now he's seeing some more.

                      GRAHAM
                (stands)
         I want to see Lecktor now.

                     DR. CHILTON
         Uh... sure...


INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY

We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters.
An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the
bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN
and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer
to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single
chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now:


GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL

A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham
from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The
occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In
the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the
cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He
appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not
stirred. Then:

                      LECKTOR
         That's the same atrocious aftershave
         you wore in court three years ago.

                      GRAHAM
         I keep getting it for Christmas.


CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD

turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain.
Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham
is the patient.
                      LECKTOR
         Did you get my card?

                     GRAHAM
         I got it. Thank you.
26.


GRAHAM' S
struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his
emotional reactions.

              LECKTOR
      And how is Officer Stuart? The one
      who was the first to see my basement.

              GRAHAM
      Stuart is fine.

              LECKTOR
      Emotional problems, I hear. He was
      a very promising young officer. Do
      you ever have any problems, Will?

              GRAHAM
      No.

              LECKTOR
      Of course, you don't.
          (pause)
      I'm glad you came. My callers are
      all professional. Clinical
      psychiatrists from cornfield colleges
      somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.

              GRAHAM
      Dr. Bloom showed me your article on
      surgical addiction in the journal
      of Clinical Psychiatry.

              LECKTOR
      And?

              GRAHAM
      Very interesting, even to a layman.

Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his
head. Then:

              LECKTOR
      A layman.., layman. Interesting
      term. So many experts on government
      grants. And you say you're a
      'layman?' But it was you who caught
      me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know
      how you did it'

              GRAHAM
      You've read the transcript. It's
      all there.

              LECKTOR
      No it's not. Do you know how you
      Did it Will?

27.
        GRAHAM
It's in the transcript. What does
it matter now?

        LECKTOR
    (smiles)
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

        GRAHAM
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.

        LECKTOR
Yes, I thought so.

        GRAHAM
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.

        LECKTOR
Yes .

        GRAHAM
You read about it, I'm sure.

        LECKTOR
In the papers. I don't rear out the
articles.
    (laughs)
I wouldn't want them to think I was
dwelling on anything morbid. You
want to know how he's choosing them,
don't you?

        GRAHAM
I thought you would have some ideas.

        LECKTOR
Why should I tell you?

        GRAHAM
There are things you don't have.
Research materials... I could speak
to the Chief of Staff...?

        LECKTOR
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He
fumbles at your head like a freshman
pulling at a panty girdle.
    (laugh;)
He actually tries to give me a
Thematic and Apperception test.
Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to
come up. It's a card with a woman
in bed and a man in the foreground.
I was supposed to avoid a sexual
interpretation. I laughed in his
face.
    (beat)
Never mind, it's boring.

28.

               GRAHAM
      You'll get to see the file on this
      case. And there's another reason.

              LECKTOR
      Pray tell.

               GRAHAM
      I thought you might be curious to
      find our if you're smarter than
      the person I'm looking for.

               LECKTOR
      Then by implication, you think that
      you are smarter than me, since you
      caught me.

               GRAHAM
      No. I knew that I'm nor smarter
      than you are.

               LECKTOR
      Then how did you catch me, Will?

              GRAHAM
      You had disadvantages.

              LECKTOR
      What disadvantage?.

              GRAHAM
      You're insane.


              LECKTOR
      You're very tan, Will.

Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a
tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to
Lecktor.

               LECKTOR
      Your hands are rough. They don't
      look like a cop s hands anymore.
      That shaving lotion is something a
      child would select. It has a ship
      on the bottle, doesn't it?

Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling
into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to
find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then
relaxes:

               LECKTOR
      Don't think you can persuade me with
      appeals to my intellectual vanity.


29.


              GRAHAM
     I don't think I'll persuade you.
     You'll do it or you won't. Dr.
     Bloom is working an it anyway, and
     he's the best...

              LECKTOR
          (interrupts)
     Do you have the file with you

             GRAHAM
     Yes.

             LECKTOR
     Pictures?

             GRAHAM
     Yes.

              LECKTOR
     let me have them,, and I might
     consider it.

             GRAHAM
     No.

             LECKTOR
     Do you dream much, Will?

             GRAHAM
     Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

              LECKTOR
     You haven't threatened to take away
     my books yet.

Graham gets up and starts to walk away.

              LECKTOR
     let me have the file. Then I'll
     tell you what I think.


Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant.
Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding
tray. Lecktor pulls it through.


GRAHAM
sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take
one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:






30.

GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP
DR. LECKTOR

Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour-
nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with-
no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc
All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light.
Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The
shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high
resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a
hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the
mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:

              LECKTOR (O.S.)
      There is a very shy boy, Will.


GRAHAM

snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor.

              LECKTOR
      What were the yards like?

              GRAHAM
      Big backyards, fences, some hedges,
      why?

              LECKTOR
      Because, my dear Will, if this
      Pilgrim imagines he has a
      relationship with the full moon,
      he might go outside and look at it.
      Have you seen blood in moonlight,
      Will? It appears quite black. If
      one were nude, it would be better
      to have outdoor privacy for this
      sort of thing.

              GRAHAM
      That's interesting.

              LECKTOR
      It's not 'interesting'. You thought
      of it before.

              GRAHAM
      Yes. I'd considered it.

              LECKTOR
      You came here to look at me, Will.
      To get the old scent again, didn't
      you?

              GRAHAM
      I want your opinion.


31.

                       LECKTOR
          I don't have one right now.

                       GRAHAM
          When you do have one I'd like to
          hear it.

                      LECKTOR
          May I keep the file?

                      GRAHAM
          I haven't decided yet.

                       LECKTOR
          I'll study it, Will. When you get
          more files, I'd like to see them,
          too. You can call me. When I
          have to call my lawyer, they bring
          me a telephone. Would you like to
          give me your home number?

Threat.


                       GRAHAM
          No.

                       LECKTOR
          Do you know how you caught me,
          Will?

                       GRAHAM
          Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can
          leave messages for me at the number
          on the file.

Graham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked.
Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to
get unlocked faster!

                       LECKTOR
          Do you know how you caught me?

The door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run
through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears
is :

                       LECKTOR (O.S.)
          The reason you caught me, Will, is:
          we're just alike. You want the
          scent? Smell yourself.

The DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor.

towards the outside door. The door is a rectangle of white
light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly
polished institution's floor. Graham walks for the light.

The DOOR SLAMS open and Graham comes out into daylight and
air. The air is tactile to him. He can almost feel the
motes of dust and light that swim freely. He breathes.


GRAHAM'S POV: GRASS

breakup. As it returns to a normal green...


TIGHT SHOT: GRAHAM

breathes. He stands in front of the sign on the building:
"CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE." He
leans against the railing and breathes clean air. The image
is flattened in a LONG LENS. We hear a CLICK. It FOCUSES
and DE-FOCUSES.

INT. G:,TEWAY LABS - SCREEN DIVIDED INTO FOUR QUADRANTS - DAV

The quadrants display 4 home movies at six times normal
speed: an old couple, 2 men, a baby and a family. The fam-
ily quadrant slows to normal. We TIGHTEN in on it. We will
come to know these people as the SHERMANS. An 11-year-old boy,
a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade
sign says:   "THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL." Mrs. Sherman has
brown hair.  She wears a bikini.   She has a nice body. She's
sensuous and tan in her thirties.  She dives into the pool.
The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs.
Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair.

33.

A couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the
image. Mrs. Sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool
and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis-
tening. Her teeth are white. She smiles at the camera.
Whoever controls the console puts Mrs. Sherman in reverse.
It runs forward again. Mrs. Sherman's glistening body coming
our of the water...


REAR SHOT: CONSOLE AND A MAN

Beyond is the screen. The man at the console is FRANCIS
DOLLARHYDE. He has a weightlifter's body. We don't see his
face. Black goggles with red lenses are on the console. He
puts them on and watches Mrs. Sherman...

A newspaper's under his arm. As he waits to pay, EILEEN
approaches. She, too, wears goggles, but on a lanyard around
her neck. She's petite, fragile. Dollarhyde towers over her.

                     EILEEN
         Mr. Dollarhyde?

CLOSER - DOLLARHYDE

looks up.


34.

His face bears the scars of a Z-plast procedure to fix a
harelip and cleft palate. Immediately, in characteristic
gesture, he curls his right hand under his nose to hide
his Z-plast scars.

                     DOLLARHYDE
         Yes, Eileen.

                     EILEEN

         Bill told me to tell you there was
         a variation in the gamma of the
         number three developer. But he
         caught it.

                     DOLLARHYDE

         within tolerances.

                     DOLLARHYDE
         Thank you, Eileen.

Graciously Dollarhyde lets her go first and then he crosses
to an empty table. He opens his newspaper.


TRACK ACROSS FRANCIS DOLLARHME'S BACK

where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and
past his cheap haircut's line at the nape of his neck into
his left shoulder to reveal he's reading the National Tattler.
It's about Will Graham with a Freddie Lounds byline. The
only words we catch are: "FBI Manhunter Consults Fiend Who
Tried To Kill Him, by Freddie Lounds." We also catch: "The
Tooth Fairy - Psychopathic Slayer of Entire Families in
Birmingham and Atlanta..."


CLOSE: FRANCIS DOLLABHYDE

takes off the black goggles with red lenses. His eyes are
white violet. He turns the page.


NATIONAL TATTLER'S OLD PICTURE OF GRAHAEI

It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor.
It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a
myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary
colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals.
The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover-
ing from Near-Fatal Slashing By Hannibal 'the Cannibal'
Lecktor."


35.

 EXTREMELY CLOSE: SECOND IMAGE OF WILL GRAHAM
 in newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi-
 tal. The half-tone dots comorising the image are visible.
 Dollarhyde's massive finger slides across the image, brush-
 ing it sensitively. It works its way to Graham's face and
 the finger stops and blots it out.

 Attendant hesitates. Then he leaves. Lecktor is allowed to
 call his attorney in privacy.

         Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom
         asked me to send a copy of 'The

hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs
the far side of the elm. His head and his cheek raise
through limbs. His eye is six inches away when he finds a
soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk.

             GRAHAM

     I love it. Sweet Jesus, yes come
     on, can.

He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt,
bracketing exposures. Then he tears a small branch and uses
it to put the can in an evidence bag. Graham climbs higher
until his foot is level to where he saw the mud. He looks
to his left. Something he sees stops him cold.


A SYMBOL

is carved in the wood.


GRAHAM

photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by
a cutting tool. Then he looks...


OVER GRAHAM'S SHOULDER: THE JACOBI HOUSE

A perfect view.

GRAHAM

high in the tree, leans back against the trunk. Re seems
frozen. Then:

             GRAHAM
          (mumbling to himself)
     ... after you killed the cat and
     threw it into the yard, my man,
     you climbed up hero and waited.
     You used a cutting tool on these
     branches so you could see.

      When night came, you saw them
      passing their bright windows and
      you watched the shades go down,
      and you saw the lights go out one

Graham and us hear a telephone booth door slam open. We hear
a receiver fall with a CLANG. He hear faint voices. The
receiver bangs as it's swung on the cord. Everyone in the

      One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty-

      What else have you got?

                GRAHAM
      Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers
      from an electric razor they let

      Twenty minutes max.

                GRAHAM
      The main thing is: how was Lecktor
      to reply.

                BOWMAN
      That's probably in the part Lecktor
      tore out.

      It looks like Lecktor went over it
      with a felt tip pen and then folded
      it and pinched most of it away.

      He doesn't have anything to cut with.


BOWMAN

very oblique.

Under the oblique light the tooth impressions stand out.
We hear a SHUTTER CLICK as they are photographed.

A pane of glass descends on the note and flattens the jagged

In thirty-five minutes.

After we find Lecktor's response,
we substitute our own. Somewhere
tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will
actually buy Tattler, looking for
Lecktor's message. Here's
what he'll find, Bill.

Let's get to the physical.

There was no print. I'm here for
kicks .


         BEVERLY KATZ
One whisker. Scale counts and core
size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So
does color. The color's different
than the Tooth Fairy's taken in
Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue
grains and some dark flecks went to
Brian's end.

                BRIAN ZELLAR
      The grains are commercial granulated
      cleanser with chlorine. Must be from
      the cleaning man. There are several
      particles of dried blood. Not enough

      "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it.
      It's being Telexed to you right now.

      'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'








59.


               GRAHAM
      That's it. Lecktor called him a
      Pilgrim when he was talking to me...

      No.

      The numbers aren't right for a

               CRAWFORD
      Book code?





60.


               BOWMAN
     'One hundred prayers' could be the
     page number. The paired numbers
     and the scriptural references could
     be line and letter. But what book?

              CBAWFORD
     Not the Bible?

               BOWMAN
     No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians
     has only six chapters. The same
     with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four
     chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a
     Bible.

               GRAHAM
     Then the Tooth Fairy named the
     book in the part Lecktor tore out.

               BOWMAN
     Right .
           (beat)
     What about sweating Lecktor?

               GRAHAM
     They tried sodium amytal on him
     three years ago to find where he
     buried a Princeton student.
           (beat)
     He gave them a recipe for potato
     chip dip.

               BOWMAN
     it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy
     would know Lecktor has in his cell.

               GRAHAM
     He'd know it from articles he's
     read about Lecktor...

              CRAWFORD
     Willingham, when he tossed his
     cell, took Polaroids so they could
     get everything back in place...

               BOWMAN
     Have him meet me with pictures of
     Lecktor's books...

               CRAWFORD
     Where?

              BOWMAN
     Library of Congress.

Bowman's our the door.






61.


               GRAHAM
      Twenty-five minutes. We won't
      make it in time.

               CRAWFORD
           (looks at watch)
      We let Lecktor's message run as is
      and decode it after. Or we pull
      it, work our the code and put ours
      in next week.

               GRAHAM
      Can we still get Lecktor's message
      out of the paper?

               CRAWFORD
      Yes. And I'm leery of running
      Lecktor's message without knowing
      what it says.

               GRAHAM
      And if we pull it, we lose a week...
      We only have two to the next full
      moon .


               CRAWFORD
      It's your call, Will. What do we
      do?

Graham has to decide. Long pause. Then he looks up:

               GRAHAM
      Run it.

               CRAWFORD
      What if it encourages the Tooth
      Fairy to do something besides
      write?

I was in the hospital after Garrett
Jacob Hobbs.

         KEVIN
How did it happen?

         GRAHAM
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking
college girls and he killed them.

         KEVIN
How?

         GRAHAM
With a knife.

               GRAHAM (CONT'D)
           (beat)
      I found a curly piece of metal in
      the clothes of one of the girls.
      The kind of shred a pipe threader
      makes. I was taking a look at
      steam fitters, plumbers. It took
      a long time. In one place there
      was a resignation letter from a
      man named Hobbs. I saw it and it
      was.., peculiar.
           (beat)
      I was going up these stairs to
      Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway
      up when he shoved his wife down
      at me. She was dying.
           (beat)
      I sent the officer with me to call
      a SWAT team. But I could hear kids
      in there and screaming. I couldn't
      wait .

               KEVIN
      You went in the apartment?

               GRAHAM
      Yes. Hobbs had one of his
      daughters from behind. He was
      cutting her. I shot him.


We get the feeling Graham is leaving out lots of pieces and
gives Kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know.


               GRAHAM
      I kept thinking there must be some
      way I could have handled it better.
      It kept replaying in my mind.
      Later I got depressed. A doctor
      friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked
      me to go into a hospital. After a
      while I got some distance on it
      and was okay.


               KEVIN
      Did the girl die?

               GRAHAM
      No.

               KEVIN
      She got all right?

               GRAHAM
      ...after a while.

               KEVIN
      And Hobbs died?



69.

               GRAHAM
           (nods)

      ... yes.

Kevin pauses, then asks with 11-year-old innocence:

               KEVIN
      Killing somebody feels that bad?

EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM
turns and stares at Kevin:

               GRAHAM
      Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in
      the world.

Kevin thinks about this for a long time. He nods. He feels
he understands Graham and is closer to him for it:

               KEVIN
      What kind of coffee do you like?

               GRAHAM
      Huh?

               KEVIN
      You like that Colombian stuff, don't
      you?

Kevin reaches for the coffee and puts it in the basket.

               KEVIN
      Mom likes that, too.



REAR SHOT: KEVIN + GRAHAM

walk down the aisle. Graham puts his hand over Kevin's
shoulder. They look like father and son. As they disappear
around a corner...

                            CUT TO:


EXT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, BACKYARD - REAR SHOT: GRAHAM +
MOLLY - NIGHT

Beyond is Chesapeake Bay and the nightlights of Baltimore
reflecting across it. The swimming float bobs in the
distance. One yellow light is on it.


FRONTAL: MOLLY + GRAHAM.

The grass looks cold in the moonlight. Holly wears a heavy
cardigan.






70.

Behind them -- with yellow lights -- the house looks like
a motel.

               MOLLY
      It's hard to have anything, isn't it?
      Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This
      is a damn slippery planet.

When she said this she was staring out to sea. Now she turns
to look at Graham and puts a hand on his arm. He still stares
out to sea:

               GRAHAM
      Slick as hell.

Then Graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own.

               MOLLY
      You remember when we first met?
      And were together alone in that
      room. And the exhilaration was
      too much to hold on to. And then
      something flickered across your
      face like a shadow and I asked you
      what was wrong?

               GRAHAM
      I remember.

               MOLLY
      Do you remember what you said?

               GRAHAM
      Yes. I said this is too good to live...

Molly stares into his eyes.

               MOLLY
      Time is luck, Will.
           (heat )
      I know the value of our days...


They stare into each other. There's a pause. They rise.
She puts her arm around Graham's waist. They start towards
the house.


               MOLLY
      Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.

                            CUT TO:


INT. FBI CAFETERIA - CRAWFORD + BLOOM - DAY

               CRAWFORD
      I need to talk to you about Will
      Graham.





71.

                BLOOM
What about him?

                CRAWFORD
I need to ask you questions of a
psychological nature.

                BLOOM
Remember when you asked for a
study on him, I refused. Same
goes for now.

                CRAWFORD
That was Peterson upstairs.

                BLOOM
It was you who did the asking.

                CRAWFORD
He doesn't think you run mind games
on him.

                BLOOM
I wouldn't presume to try.

                CRAWFORD
You're never alone in a room with
Graham, are you? You're smooth
about it, but you're never one-on-
one with him. Why's that? Do you
think he's psychic?

                BLOOM
He's an eideteker. He has almost
total recall.   But I don't think
he's psychic.   What he has it empathy
and projection  He can assume your
point of view and mine.., and some
other points of view that scare and
sicken him.


                CRAWFORD
Why aren't you ever alone with him?


                BLOOM
Because I'm professionally
concerned about him. And he'd
pick up on that. He's fast. He
hates being prodded and poked.
    (beat)
So do I.
    (beat)
What do you want?

                CRAWFORD
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs.
Could he kill again if he had to save
his life? Or would he hesitate?




72.


                BLOOM
      I'll tell you the events. The
      psychology's none of your business.
      Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven-
      year-old daughter's throat. Graham
      shot him with his .38 six times.
      Hobbs still didn't go down. He had
      to wade in...

               CRAWFORD
      That's when it happened?

                BLOOM
      No. It happened when Graham went
      to see Hobbs' daughter four months
      later in the hospital. She saved
      her carotid artery.., but lost
      three fingers and her larynx. She
      was connected up to a voice box.
      When Graham went to see her, she
      asked him -- through the speaker:
      'Why did you have to kill my
      daddy? '
           (beat)
      That's when Graham had his nervous
      breakdown.

               CRAWFORD
      What's the bottom line?

                BLOOM
      If he pushes too deep into our boy's
      mind-set, he may destroy himself.
           (beat)
      What are you planning, Jack?

                CRAWFORD
      Could he handle a direct contact?

               BLOOM
      I don't recommend it.

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      You don't recommend what, Sidney?

Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't.

                BLOOM
      Crawford has a proposition. I
      don't think it's a good idea.

                GRAHAM
      If the Tooth Fairy listens to
      Lecktor, he'll come for me. So
      we're going to set me up as bait
      to draw him out. Give him a
      clean shot.
                (MORE)





73.

               GRAHAM (CONT'D)
           (beat)
      That's what you were thinking,
      isn't it?

Crawford's embarrassed. Bloom said Graham was fast.

               GXAHAM
      I'll use Lounds.

Now Bloom's surprised...


               GRAHAM
      Sidney, he doesn't read the "Sunday
      Times literary supplement. He
      reads Lounds in the "Tattler."
           (beat)
      And I want this over with... Fast.


                             CUT TO:

INT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT - GRAHAM + LOUNDS - DAY
Graham leans against a table, his back to a window.
               GRAHAM
      I believe he's socially
      maladjusted. Laughed at by his
      contemporaries...

               LOUNDS
      How does he rate compared to Dr,
      Hannibal Lecktor?

               GRAHAM
      He's not as intelligent.


PULL BACK to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and
assistant. Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his
tape recorder.

               GRAHAM
          (to Bloom)
      What have we missed?

               BLOOM
      He may have an unconscious
      homosexual conflict. A fear of
      being gay. He objects to the word
      'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains
      indicate that he put the shorts on
      Charles Leeds after he was dead.
      I believe he did this to emphasize
      his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds.

Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again.







74.
                 GRAHAM
       The killer has sexually molested
       all his male victims. He is a
       homosexual and impotent with
       persons of the opposite sex.
           (beat)
       Our forensic psychologists have
       projected he may have been the
       product of an incestuous home
       life .
           (added afterthought)
       And probably had sexual relations
       with his mother...

Crawford stifles a laugh...

                LOUNDS
       How long will you stay in
       Washington?

                GBAHAM
       Until we've taken out the Tooth
       Fairy.

Graham gestures for Lounds to turn off the tape recorder.

                GRAHAM
       All right. Let's shoot the
       pictures .

                LOUNDS
           (to Crawford)
       I want shots with me and Graham
       together .


Graham reacts.

                LOUNDS
       C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You want
       this to look real, don't you?



STILL PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV THROUGH CAMERA: GRAHAM + LOUNDS

Lounds lays Graham's arm over his own shoulder and mugs :or
the camera. Behind him is the flood-lit Capitol dome and
the sign of a motel across the street.


                GRAHAM
       Keep the motel sign across the
       street just slightly out of focus.
       He has to be able to read it, but
       it can't look too obvious.


Lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits.
The photographer starts breaking down his gear. Crawford
takes Graham aside.

               CRAWFORD

      Asian studies at Langley said the
      mark you found on the tree is a
      Chinese character considered a
      positive or a lucky sign in
      gambling. The character also
      appears on a mah-jongg piece.
           (beat)
      It means Red Dragon.
           (beat)
      That mean anything to you?

SPURGEN, chief SWAT instructor from Quantico, examines the
parking lot. We've cut in mid-dialogue.

               SPURGEN
      ...if he's smart he'll approach
      from the front, pass, and take you
      from the back. How well do you
      hear?

               GRAHAM
      Pretty well.

               SPURGEN
      I'm gonna spray your suit jackets.
      It'll be invisible in this light,
      but you'll stand out like a zebra
      for us.
           (beat)
      They told me you checked out a .44
      Charter Arms Bulldog.

               GI(AHAM
      Yes .

               SPURGEN
      Good. You'll load these, Ever
      fire them?

Spurgen hands Graham a glycine envelope containing 25 rounds
of .44 Special ammunition.



GRAHAM EXAMINES ONE ROUND

Instead of a lead bullet, there's a matte-black, blunt-nosed
cylinder .

      Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon
      in a copper casing. On impact it

      Body armor?

               GRAHAM
      Kevlar Second Chance.

                SPURGEN
      I hope you have a second chance...

                GRAHAM
      Because he's gone for the head shot
      seven out of eight times'

               SPURGEN
      You got it.

               GRAHAM
      Let's walk the route.

As they start across the parking lot:

                            CUT TO:


INT. LAMBERT ST. LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - FLOOR

We've been here before. The floor is empty. In the WIDE
ANGLE -- OUT OF FOCUS -- the NEWSSTAND OPERATOR is squatted
down reading the "Chicago Tribune." In the empty space is
dumped a bundle of "Tattlers" A pair of black zippered boots
enters and stands behind the man.


                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
           (without looking)
      What is it?

               VOICE (O.S.)
      A "Tattler."

               NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
      You'll have to wait until I bust a
      bundle.

One black boot kicks the "Tattler" bundle.

               VOICE (O.S.)
      Now.





77.

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
           (hot)
       I said wait 'til I bust a bundle.
       Understand?

A hand and a flash of bright steel rip through the FRAME.
The wire is cut with a POP. A dollar bill is thrown on
the floor. The hand whips a "Tattler" out from the center of
the bundle. RAISE UP WITH the outraged Newsstand Operator.

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
       Hey. Hey you.

The retreating man turns to face him. It is Francis
Dollarhyde.

                DOLLARHYDE
       Me?

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR
       Yeah, you. Fuckin' told you...

                DOLLARHYDE
              (interrupting)
            You told me what?

He starts coming back. He rakes off his silver sunglasses
revealing the white violet eyes.

                DOLLARHYDE
       You told me what?!


CLOSE: NEWSSTAND OPERATOR

                NEWSSTAND OPERATOR

GRAHAM

... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the
apartment building.., hears something through the delicate
patter of the rain.



GRAHAM'S POV: CORNER OF BUILDING

A distant "plop-plop-plop" of running feet...


GRAHAM'S
eyes tighten.


CORNER OF BUILDING

HOLD. Then entering around the corner is a running MAN.
He's 6'2". He's heavy and wears a running suit with the
hood up. His face is lost in its shadow.



RUNNER'S RIGHT HAND

is gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket, grasping
something...



RUNNER'S FEET ACROSS WET BLACK TARMAC
splash through shallow puddles.


GRAHAM'S FACE

in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER...



GBAHAM'S EYES

like taut wire about to snap.







79.
WIDE PROFILE:  GRAHAM
on the left.   The Runner enters on the right. In SLOW MOTION
as they cross, Graham slams him sideways...


RUNNER

is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side
of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to
fight ...


.44 BULLDOG

comes up.., pressure on the trigger.


RUNNER'S HEAD

turns INTO CAMERA. He is a black man with a moustache and
scared eyes staring into the .44. His hands shoot into the
air:

               RUNNER (MAN)
      Yo, boss. Plastic and cash in the
      right pocket...!

               GRAHAM
               (re the mistake)
      God-dammit!!!

Walking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest.
Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive.
The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two
D.C. cops are running in.


               RUNNER
      Arrest dat sucker...!

Crawford catches up to Graham:


               CRAWFORD
      You okay?

Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest
across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile,
Spurgen is with the Runner.


               SPURGEN
      It was a mistake . Sorry we...



               RUNNER
      'Sorry' yo' mama!!

Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops
him.

LOUNDS


pleased with himself, walks to his car.


REAR: LOUNDS' HEAD

enters FRAME, unlocking his car door. A hand falls on
Lounds' shoulder and turns him INTO CAMERA: Lounds' self-

               LOUNDS
      My back hurts, my skin. Did I get
      burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Burned? Burned. No. You just
      rest there. I'll be right back.

      I don't want to know.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      According to you I'm a sexual
      failure. An animal, you said.
           (beat)
      You know now, don't you?

               LOUNDS
      Yes .

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you feel privileged?

               LOUNDS
      I'm very scared.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      Yes .








82.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Do you believe God is in attendance
      here, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      I don't know...

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      In a little while I'll help you
      understand.

A kettle WHISTLES.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      I'll be right back.
           (singsong)
      Don't... go away...

As if he had any choice. Lounds' face moves; He strains.
His arms are glued to the chair. Dollarhyde's hand comes
back with a cup of tea and a straw. Lounds sips.

               LOUNDS
      I'd do a big story. Anything you
      want to say. Describe you any way
      you want or no description!

The hand rips off the sanitary napkins covering Lounds' eyes.
Lounds jams his eyes shut. The lights brighten. A single
finger taps the top of his head.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.

               LOUNDS
      No. I don't want to see you.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
      You're here to titillate your
      readers. If you don't open your
      eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to
      your forehead.

A finger taps Lounds on his chest. A touch on his eyelids.
Lounds slowly opens his eyes. His face goes white.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (singsong)
      Well: here...I...am...


LOUNDS' POV: THE RED DRAGON

Dollarhyde opens and drops the black silk kimono.









83.

His muscular frame bears the full body tattoo of William
Blake's Red Dragon -- the head on Dollarhyde's chest, the
tail snaking down and wrapping around one of Dollarhyde's
legs. His back is to us in a weight-lifter's pose. A
rolled-up stocking covers Dollarhyde's head to just below
his nose. Dollarhyde's teeth are jagged and brown-stained.
And he smiles at Lounds in front of the white screen.

               LOUNDS (O.S.)
      Oh my dear God Jesus.


LOUNDS

turns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head.
The kimono is on again.


PAST LOUNDS' HEAD: SCREEN

A slide appears. It is Blake's painting.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Look at the screen. That is William
      Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and
      The Woman Clothed with the Sun.
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Yes ...

Next picture: Mrs. Jacobi, eyes wide.

               DOLLARHME
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Yes .

CLICK. Next slide. Mrs. Leeds alive, locked into a silent
scream in her bedroom.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Yes.

CLICK.


LOUNDS

staring in horror. We will not see the rest of the slider.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood,
      her husband beside her. Do you see?






84.

               LOUNDS
      Yes .

                DOLLARHYDE
      Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
           (as Lounds nods)
      The Dragon rampant. Do you see?


               LOUNDS
      Yes .

               DOLLARHYDE
      Freddie Lounds. Your photograph.

      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Oh, God.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Do you see?

               LOUNDS
      Please, no.

               DOLLARHYDE
      'No' what?

               LOUNDS
      Not me.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Are you a man?

               LOUNDS
      Yes.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Do you imply that I'm a queer?

               LOUNDS
      God, no.

               DOLLARHYI)E
      Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?

               LOUNDS
      No.



REAR OF DOLLARHYDE'S HEAD

Beyond him is the screen and the image of Freddie Lounds with
Graham's arm over his shoulder.








85.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Before me you are a slug in the sun.
      You are privy to a great becoming
      and you recognize nothing. You are
      an ant in the afterbirth.
           (beat)
      It is your nature to do only one
      thing correctly: tremble. Bur fear
      is not what you owe me. Lounds:
      you and the others, YOU OWE ME AWE!
           (long pause)
      We have one more piece of work to do.

Dollarhyde leaves. Lounds closes his eyes.

                LOUNDS
           (to himself)
        Didn't take off the mask. Please,
      God, let him not take off the mask.
      If he comes back with it off, I'm dead...


DOLLARHME'S HAND

carries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds'
face .
                DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.

Lounds obeys.


CLOSE: DOLLARHYDE

The stocking mask and teeth -- stained and jagged -- are in
place.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Now you will read this into the
      tape recorder.


ON LOUNDS

                LOUNDS
      'I have had a great privilege. I have
      seen with wonder the strength of the
      Red Dragon. All I wrote about him
      before was lies from Will Graham. He
      made me write them. Now I understand.
           (beat)
      'Will Graham: you will learn from my
      own lips how much you have to dread.
      Because I was forced to lie, he will
      be more merciful to me than to you.
           (beat)
      'I will be a testament to the truth, now.
      About his work. About his becoming.'






86.

DOLLARHYDE'S HAND
turns off the tape recorder.

                DOLLARHYDE
      You did very well.   I apologize for
      the crude images.    Next time I'll
      have film stock that doesn't need
      lights .

               LOUNDS
      You'll let me go now?

               DOLLARHYDE
      You will tell the truth?

               LOUNDS
      Absolutely,

DOLLARHYDE
      Good .
           (beat)
      We'll seal your promise with...


DOLLARHYDE'S FACE,

with the stocking rolled down over his nose, smiles his
dentured smile. And with his kimono open, revealing the
face of the dragon emblazoned in crimson on his muscular
torso; he leans INTO CAMERA...


               DOLLARHYDE
      ... with a kiss.



VERY WIDE ANGLE

The figures seen from the back. We don't know what Dollar-
hyde, leaning over Lounds, is doing, but Lounds screams.

                            CUT TO:



EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT

Dollarhyde's van is on the left against the wall. The alley
is empty. Then we see shapes between the van and the wall.



CLOSER: OVER LOUNDS' RIGHT SHOULDER

We do not see his face. We see his shoulder and his lap.
From an unseen facial wound, blood drips onto his pants' leg.
Dollarhyde starts spilling liquid on Lounds. Lounds starts
to moan and rouse from unconsciousness. His head starts to
turn. He knows he's going to die. And he has some courage.




87.

               LOUNDS
      Go 'head and kill 'ee, you 'astard!
      You rot in 'ell. rot in 'ell!

INT. "TATTLER" GARAGE - OVER PARKING ATTENDANT'S RIGHT
SHOULDER ON THE RACING FORM - NIGHT

He pencils some selections. START TRACKING LEFT ACROSS
the back of his neck. Midway we hear the SQUEAK of a wheel-
chair. The parking attendant hears it, too. As the TRACK
CONTINUES OVER his left shoulder he puts down the Racing
form and looks. Nothing. Then he goes back to the Racing
Form.


PARKING ATTENDANT

reads. Now the wheels SQUEAK and ECHO LOUDER. His head
raises again...


OVER PARKING ATTENDANT'S LEFT SHOULDER

He turns INTO CAMERA. There's a loud WOOSH. His eyes go
wide. He explodes out of his chair, SCREAMING.


WHAT HE SEES: LOUNDS IN WHEELCHAIR - A MAN AFLAME

Lounds is a fireball racing TOWARDS US. Just before the
fireball would smash into CAMERA...

                            CUT TO:


INT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GRAHAM + MOLLY - NIGHT

Graham and Molly are sitting at the kitchen table over cups
of coffee. It's dark. Graham is looking down into the Formica.
He and Molly say nothing for a long time. Then:

               MOLLY
      Can I have one of your cigarettes?

               GRAHAM
           (surprised)
      You haven't smoked in two years.

               MOLLY
      I'd like one of your cigarettes,
      please.

Graham gives her one. Molly lights up. She picks a piece or
tobacco from her lips. She's trying to control fear.







88.

               MOLLY
      Have you ever omitted telling me.
      things before?

               GRAHAM
      No.

               MOLLY
      Then why?

               GRAHAM
      I wanted it over fast.
           (beat)
      It felt dirty to not tell you.

               MOLLY
      Can you quit?

               GRAHAM
      No.

               MOLLY
      And... where are things?

               GRAHAM
      Where we're at is nowhere. We have
      nothing. We're running out of time.

There is a long pause. Molly suspects:

               MOLLY
      What will you do?

               GRAHAM
      I have to go back to Birmingham.

               MOLLY
      Is Crawford going with you?

               GRAHAM
      No. I have to be. in there...       
      alone. Maybe there's something for
      me if I know how he feels and thinks.

               MOLLY
      William: you are going to make
      yourself Sick or get yourself killed.

Graham says nothing.

               MOLLY
      Kevin and I have lived through... with
      Kevin's father... once before... and
      we can't...

She can't finish. There's a pause. Then: She looks at him.








89.

                GRAHAM
      You should go to Montana. Stay with
      Kevin's grandparents. They haven't
      seen him for a while.
           (beat)
      I'll come and get you afterwards...

                MOLLY
      Will


He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about
himself:

                GRAHAM
      Molly.
           (pause)
       I love you. And I'm not really
      going to be fit to be with for
      awhile...


They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate.
Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham
sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around
his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the
mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen.


                            CUT TO:

INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT - GRAHAM - DAY
On a pay phone to Dr. Bloom.


                GBAHAM
      Sidney: I don't understand him.
      We know he re-arranges the kids
      and husbands into a dead audience.
      To witness the act. We know he
      thinks the act is making him into
      something different. His 'becoming'
      ...but I don't know what it is he
      thinks he's becoming.
           (beat)
      The answer is something to do with
      how he uses the mirrors. That's
      what's missing for me. why the
      mirrors?

                BLOOM (V.O.)
      The usual motivation doesn't apply
      to him, nor the way he uses them.
      I don't have an answer for you.
           (beat)
      Listen to me, my friend: leave this.








90.


               GRAHAM
      And do what? Read about the next
      family in the morning paper? In
      my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I
      can't take my family home?
           (beat)
      This ends when I make it over.

               BLOOM (V.O.)
      How are Molly and the boy?

               GRAHAM
      Kevin and Molly are on their way

      Who the hell is he to do this to

INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT, COFFEE SHOP - WINDOW - LATE
AFTERNOON

Outside is gray. Rain stripes the glass. Sheets of rain
whip across the silver planes and yellow utility vehicles.



CLOSE: WINDOW

Graham's hand enters and flattens against his half-reflection
on the cool glass. He hears:

               VALERIE LEEDS (V.O.)
           (ansaphone
           recording )
      'Hello. This is Valerie Leeds. I'm

               GRAHAM
      I'm sorry, too...

               WAITRESS
      Excuse me...?

Graham turns. The WAITRESS looks at him strangely.

               GRAHAM
      Coffee ...

She leaves. Graham sits. He stares at his handprint and
says :






91.

                GRAHAM
      It's just YOU and me now, sport.
      And I'd better hurry up and find you.

      Because I'm losing all this...

                            CUT TD:


INT. DARKROOM - DOLLABHYDE - NIGHT

Entering. It is almost totally dark. In the green dullness
we make our the forms of a WOMAN and Dollarhyde.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde.
      I came about the low light level
      infrared film stock.

                REBA (WOMAN)
Put your back against the doer.
      Come forward three steps until you
      feel the tile an your feet and there
      will be a stool just to your left.

We see Dollarhyde's form follow instructions and sit.

                REBA
Can you give me an idea of the
      conditions...

               DOLLARHYDE
      Shooting at maybe eight feet. I
      can't use any lights.

               REBA
      What's being photographed?

               DOLLARHYDE
      The activities of nocturnal animals.

               REBA
      When do you need it?

               DOLLARHYDE
      In eight days.

                REBA
      Let me stick this in the black hole.

We see some movements. Then the light comes on.

DOLLARHYDE'S

hand is curled under his nose, hiding his Z-plast scars.
Then he reacts to something. His face lights up in an
uncharacteristically open smile.







92.

He brazenly looks the woman up and down. We don't understand
why he can do this.


REBA McCLAIN

is blind. Her white cane is propped in the corner. She's
thirty with a handsome prairie face.

                REBA
      The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film
      must be handled in total darkness.
      I keep the samples straight by touch
      code .
           (beat)
      It's still easier to handle than a
      1200 series. Think it'll do?

               DOLLARHYDE
      It'll do fine.


RALPH DANDRIDGE,

young manager of the department enters, checks watch.

                DANDRIDGE
      Reba, dear, I've got to fly.
           (beat)
      Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be
      too much trouble could you help her
      home ?

                REBA
      I can 'help' myself home, Ralph...

Dandridge leaves. Dollarhyde stares after him. He doesn't
Like him. Then:

               DOLLARHYDE
      I'LL take you.

                BEBA
           (standing close)
      No, thanks. I manage very well.
           (beat)
      I'LL order you twelve hundred feet:
      of 1000 C tomorrow.

Reba walks our of the dark room.

                            CUT TO:


INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN, TRAVELLING - OUT OF WINDOW - NIGHT

We pass Reba on the sidewalk. She is walking briskly with
her cane and tapping in front of her. She's very confident.






93.

                DOLLARHYDE
       Ride with me.

                REBA
       Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I
       do it all the time.

DOLLARHYDE
       Dandridge is a condescending prick.
       Ride with me. It would be because
       I want you to.

Reba stops. She likes Dollarhyde's directness. He gets our
and comes around to help her in. He starts to take her arm.

                REBA
       It's better if I rake your arm.

                            CUT TO:


INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - DOOR - NIGHT

We hear footsteps come up. Reba's key is in the lock.
As the door is starting to open:

                REBA
       Come on in.
           (beat)
       How about a gin and tonic?


                DOLLARHYDE
       Tonic will be fine.


                REBA
       In the kitchen.


INT. REBA'S DUPLEX, KITCHEN - REBA

enters. She momentarily forgets, retraces her steps and
turns on the light. She opens the refrigerator. During
the next pieces of dialogue, we will see Reba being ex-
tremely competent making the drinks.

                DOLLARHYDE
       How did you come to Gateway?


                BEBA
       They had to shape up their employment
       practices to keep this defense
       contract.

Reba takes a l0-inch chef's knife and deftly cuts the lime,
guiding it with her thumb.

                DOLLARHYDE
       You worked out well.



94.

                REBA
      You know you speak very well,
      although you avoid fricatives and
      sibilants in your speech. At the
      Riker Institute for the Blind. I
      trained in speech therapy for speech
      and hearing impaired children...


DOLLARHYDE

reacts to "speech therapy." Characteristically -- his
attention goes to:


KNIFE

in Reba's hand. Its extremely sharp cutting edge glints
in the light. Another slice of lime falls.

                REBA
      I'll probably go back to it someday.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Uh-huh.

Silence. Reba hands him his drink.

                REBA.
      If you don't want to talk. okay.
      Bur I hope you will... because I
      like what you say.

Dollarhyde is stunned, at both her perception and frankness.

                REBA
      May I touch your face?
           (as Dollarhyde reacts)
      I want to know if you're smiling
      or frowning. I want to know if I
      should just shut up or not...

There's a smile on her face. Now her hand moves up towards
Dollarhyde's mouth with the Z-plast scars where his harelip
and cleft palate were fixed.


REBA' S HAND

Dollarhyde's fist grabs it.


DOLLARHYDE


turns her hand in the light.








95.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Take my word for it that I'm...
      smiling .

There is no smile on Dollarhyde's face.

               RZBA
      If I've offended you, I didn't
      mean to.

He still has her hand in his grasp.

               DOLLARHYDE
      I have to go now.

He lets go of her hand.

                            CUT TC:


INT. BIRMINGHAM STORAGE ROOM - WILL GRAHAM - DAY

sits among piles of Leeds family possessions. He opens a
child's toy. It's large, pink plastic and heart-shaped.
It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic
clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them,


REARSHOT: GRAHAM

half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates
motes of dust in the air. Graham merely sits and stares
into all of the debris of this dead family. PULL BACK to
see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray
of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all
the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a
life by two adults and three children. Everything from
washing machines to tricycles to sleds. They litter the
vast floor space. While we WIDEN, we hear:

               VOICE :1(O.S.)
      What's he doin'? Been in there all
      day .

               VOICE :2 (O.S.)
      Just sits and stares at the stuff...

The CAMERA now includes two UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS at
the door. They watch Graham, As we WIDEN and PULL BACK
they fall into REAR SHOT. HOLD.

                            CUT TO:


INT. WHITE CORRIDOR - REBA ON DOLLARHYDE'S ARM - NIGHT

Her cane taps the white tile floor. It's antiseptic and
sinister. We worry about where he's taking her.






96.

                REBA
      Ready to tell me what kind of
      'outing' this is?

               DOLLARHYDE
      It's a surprise.

Her head arcs back as she senses:

                REBA
      Francis? We're at the zoo...!

                            CUT TO:


INT. ZOO EXAMINATIONTION ROOM - DR. WARFIELD - NIGHT

                DR. WARFIELD
      In two days we're going to cap his
      tooth. Can you smell him?

                REBA
           (aglow)
      Yes!


                DR. WARFIELD
      Are you apprehensive? Your protective
      and muscular gentleman over there is
      watching us like a cat.

               REBA
      No, no! I want to.

Dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment.

                DR. WARFIELD
      All right, put your left hand on the
      edge of the table and you can explore
      with your right. I'll be right here
      beside you.

We see Reba start to reach out. Then we see what she is about
to touch.


TEN-FOOT LONG BENGAL TIGER

Reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm.


REBA'S HAND

The fur springs between her fingers.










97.
TIGER'S GREAT PAW
Reba's hand enters down its foreleg. Warfield -- with two
hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. Reba's
hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the
claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy
supple muscles of his shoulder.


TIGER'S HEAD

Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands
feel the width of his head.


TIGER'S MOUTH

The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the
hairs on her forearms.


TIGER'S CHEST

Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face
lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's
ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills
us and Reba with its bright thunder.

                            CUT TO:


INT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE - THE GREAT RED DRAGON ARD THE WOMAN

Blake's painting. It's a large reproduction. It's a pre-
psychological evocation of violent sexual impulses. It has
come right after the image of Reba and the tiger. O.S. we
hear WATER RUNNING...

                            CUT TO:


INT. BATHROOM - FAUCET + HANDS

Hands are Reba's. We FOLLOW them up to the wall as they
search for and find a towel. O.S. we hear the hum of a
film PROJECTOR starring. We see the sightless Reba reflected
in the mirror. Feeling her way, she starts out...

                            DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LIVING BOOM - PAN

It's dark brown with wing-armed 50's-futuristic furniture. A
Sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room.
A full-sized mural from JPL of the Mars surface is on one wall.









98.


We MOVE-PAST objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors,
a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow
arms, a Magnavox console TV set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and
Reba on it. They're watching a movie.

                            DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSER: DOLLARHYDE AND REBA

The film projector hums. We don't see what movie Dollarhyde
is watching.

               REBA

           (beat)
      That was nice of you to think of that.

               DOLLARKYDE
      I made you a gin and tonic. It's by
      the side of the sofa...

Dollarhyde looks at Reba. Then he looks at the film. The
two of them are like a tableau of suburban TV-watching.
They're like a married couple sitting on the sofa. Except:


REAR SHOT OVER DOLLARHYDE + REBA TO THE SCBEEN

The movie is Mrs. Jacobi looking up, And Mrs. Leeds looking
up. And Mrs. Sherman's legs scissoring in the water. Then
her breasts swelling and shining above her suit as she pushes
herself our of the pool. Dollarhyde's blase, watching his
horror show. He looks at Reba.


REBA

unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity. Her breasts
rise and fall with her breathing. The flickering light from
the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes
of her face.


EXTREMELY CLOSE: REBA'S NECK

The smooth skin and down-like hairs undulate from the bearing
of her living heart.


DOLLARHYDE

is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and
doesn't see:










99.
REBA'S HAND
moves along the back of the sofa to Dollarhyde.


REBA

moves towards Dollarhyde's face.


ON DOLLARHYDE, AND REBA

ENTERS THE FRAME and kisses Dollarhyde on the mouth.
Dollarhyde's eyes freeze open. He is stunned. Reba's left
hand opens Dollarhyde's shirt and slides down his' chest towards
his pants...

               REBA
          (soft whisper)
      Take me upstairs...

reaction to this event is immobility and shock.

               REBA (O.S.)
      Let me get them off... it's torn...
      I don't care! Come on. My God, man.
      Yes ...

Reba's hand with her long, gentle fingers ENTERS THE FRAME
caressing the side of Dollarhyde's face. We will hear Reba's
voice and see little of her. We will see Dollarhyde's face
and the expressions on it: wonder and amazement.

               REBA (O.S.)
      You're so sweet, D...
           (heat )
        let me come up to you and take it...
           (beat)
      Yes...


Her hand moves down from his face down his neck and rests on
his chest. It rests on the face of what is tattooed there:

the Great Red Dragon.

               REBA (O.S.)
           (soft)
      Your heart is loud.
           (beat)
      Feel all of me

Dollarhyde knows what he feels: he is pole-axed. He doesn't
know what he thinks.


SAME - REBA - LATER

is asleep. She holds Dollarhyde in the near dark. His hand
caresses her forehead and brushes light brown hair from her
face .


DOLLARHME

wide awake, eases her away. Then he puts his ear to her
breast and listens to her heart beating. Dollarhyde is re-
lieved. Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder
and amazement. Then Dollarhyde leaves...


REBA

Dollarhyde re-enters FRAME and puts a glass of water next to
her. He covers her. He lays down again next to her. Reba
stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily. Dollarhyde supports the
back of her head and offers her some water.


OVERHEAD ANGLE: DOLLARHYDE + REBA

Dollarhyde's arm moves under her pillow. She snuggles closer
to him. Dollarhyde's eyes are moist.  Reba's hand moves up
his stomach and rests on his chest.   It rests above his heart.
It rests on the face of the crimson dragon. When she is asleep
again, Dollarhyde takes her hand off the great tattoo and puts
it on his face.

Dollarhyde -- cloven in two, accepted by a living Reba -- will
not sleep for a very long time.

                            CUT TO:


SAME - DOLLARHYDE - DAY

It is morning. He snaps awake. he is horror-struck: Reba's
pillow is empty. She's nor there. Dollarhyde races our of
the room.

                            CUT TO:

               REBA (O.S.)
      Is that you. D?










101.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Yes, are you okay...?!

               REBA (O.S.)
      I'm fine.


REBA

In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and
presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown
weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.


DOLLARHYDE

nears her, towers above her. He touches her face. Reba folds
into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest. His heart
is going fast. He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen-
ing to him and that she's okay.

               REBA
      Good morning...
           (kisses his cheek)
      If you show me where things are,
      I'll make us some coffee...

               DOLLARHYDE
      No! Don't go back into the house...
          (to Reba's quizzical
           reaction)
           it's too nice outside.

               REBA
      My sister's coming by to pick me up
      for brunch. Why don't you come, too?

               DOLLARHYDE
      I have work to do at the plant.

               REBA
      I'll get my purse.

               DOLLARHYDE
      I'll get it.
           (leaving)
      Stay right here. You lock very good
      in the sun...

                            CUT TO:


EXT. SERVICE STATION - ATTENDANT - DAY


He's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls
in.







102.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?

               REBA
      I'm fine, Francis.

Dollarhyde gets out.

                DOLLARHYDE
      Fill it up and check the oil, please.

Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the
nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood,
draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout
into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he
starts to move around the van he sees something in the
interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't
know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He
wipes and wipes the same spot.


REBA'S

dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat.
Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats.
From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can
look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better...


MEN'S ROOM DOOR

Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel
and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the
backside of the van.


DRIVER'S WINDOW

Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on
the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...


ATTENDANT

unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same
spot in front of Reba.


DOLLARHYDE


is coming around the van. Fast.

               DOLLARHYDE
      You sonofabitch...









103.

               ATTENDANT
           (cocky)
      You don't like it? You know what
      you can do about it...

Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him
into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once
and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...
Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it.


REBA'S FACE

through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to
roll down the window.


ATTENDANT

is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has
never seen before, anywhere.


DOLLARHYDE

pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He
advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end
of the spout.


ATTENDANT

is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the
man into the wall, compressing his thorax.

               DOLLARHYDE
      I ought to jam this in your chest,
      and drain your heart...

The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.
Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then
he throws money at the Attendant and leaves...

                            CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM - NIGHT
With Crawford on the phone.

               CRAWFORD (V.O.)
      You got the message Lecktor called...

               GRAHAM
      I arranged for him to have a phone.
      I have to call him in a few minutes.










104.

                CRAWFORD (V.O.)
      From the lip wound, which happened
      seven hours before he got burned,
      we've narrowed it down to those
      cities within the seven-hour driving
      radius that also would've caught
      the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.

               GRAHAM
      What's it narrow down to?

               CRAWFORD(V.O.)
      Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria,
      Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati,
      Toledo and Detroit.

                GRAHAM
          (laughs )
      That's narrow?

               CRAWFORD (V.O.)
      When are you coming back?

               GRAHAM
      When I'm done.

Graham hangs up the phone. He looks out the window at the
rain. He dials again.

                GRAHAM
      It's Will Graham. Is Molly there,
      Mr. Swenson?

               GRAMPA (V.0.)
      Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?!
      You sure are in the center of a
      storm. Burning up lots of
      taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.
           (beat)
      On the news they said he was a white
      man. He isn't really, is he?

                GRAHAM
      Sure he is. Blond.
          (fuck him:)
      Probably Scandinavian, too...

                GRAMPA (V.O.)
      You going back down to Florida after?


               GRAHAM
      Yes. Is Molly there?











105.

               GRAMPA (V.O.)
      My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of
      breakfast every day. Been out
      riding. Must be the good air. You
      oughta see that little booger eat.
      I'11 bet he's gained ten pounds.
           (beat)
      Molly's out in the motor home...

               GRAHAM
      I know... 'Out in the good air...'

               GRAMPA (V.O.)
      What's that?

               GRAHAM
      Tell her I called.

Graham hangs up. He dials again.

               GPAHAM
      This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton
      arranged for me to talk with Dr.
      Lecktor .

               OPERATOR (V.O.)
      I'll put you through.

INTERCUT WITH:


INT. CHESAPEAKE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.
LECKTOR'S CELL - HANNIBAL LECKTOR - DAY

picks up the phone and takes Graham's call.

               LECXTOR
      I wanted to congratulate you for the
      job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired
      it enormously. What a cunning boy
      you are. Will.

               GRAHAM
      What do you want?

               LECKTOR
      You know Lounds's enlightened me on
      one thing: your confinement in the
      mental hospital. My attorney should
      have brought that our in court.

               GRAHAM
      I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of-
      bitches. If you've got something to
      say, Lecktor, say it.









106.

               LECKTOR
      I want to help you, Will. You'd be
      more comfortable if you relaxed with
      yourself. We don't invent our
      natures, They're issued to us.
      Along with our lungs and pancreas
      and everything else. Why fight it?

               GRAHAM
      Fight what?

               LECKTOR
      When you were so depressed after
      you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to
      death, it wasn't the act that got
      you down. Didn't you really feel
      so bad because killing him felt so
      good?
           (ironic)
      And why shouldn't it feel good?! It
      must feel good to God. God does it
      all the time!

Graham laughs. Then he starts to listen closely. There is
something here for him:

               GRAHAM
      I don't believe in God.

               LECKTOR
      You should, Will. God's terrific!
           (beat)
      He dropped a church roof on thirty-
      four of His worshippers in Texas last
      Wednesday night. Just as they were
      grovelling to Him and singing a hymn.
      Don't you think that felt good?
           (beat)
      He wouldn't begrudge you two measly
      murders.

               GRAHAM 
      Why does it feel good?

               LECKTOR
      It feels good because: if you do as
      God does, enough times, you become
      as God is: powerful...

Will Graham thinks about this.

               LECKTOR
           (fading)
      God's a champ! He got a hundred and
      sixty Philippines in one plane crash
      two months ago... Remember the big
      earthquake in Italy last spring...?







107.

Lecktor's voice fades as Will Graham hangs us on him. Graham
sits on the crumpled bed and stares out the window at the rain..

                            CUT TO:


INT. LEEDS HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY

stands in the kitchen. His raincoat and rainhat drip water
onto the floor. The house no longer is a crime scene. It's
been cleaned up. It is absolutely naked. Shades are drawn.
Slashes of light hit the floor. Graham stands there. Then
he walks forward...


STAIRCASE - GRAHAM'S FEET UP TIIE STAIRS

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      I enter. The glass cutter. I lick
      the suction cup. The piece of glass
      I take out is mine. House is mine .
           (beat)
      I walk up these stairs. I pass
      childrens' toys. The children mean
      nothing to me...

The toys appear on the stairs as Graham's feet continue
moving up the stairs to the second-floor landing.


GRAHAM'S POV: APPROACHING LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM DOOR

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      I am soundless. I move to the door.
      I step into the room...


INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM: THE DOOR

It opens. Graham enters.   The room is white. We don't see
the bed. Graham stands there in profile. Beyond Graham OUT
OF FOCUS the wall starts to discolor. Pieces of plaster
start to fall. The room starts to disintegrate around Graham.
We will see what Graham sees in his mind.

                CRAHAM
      I see you there. I breathe in the
      perfume of this room. I am in the
      inner sanctum of a life. You will
      accept me. Take me into you.


GRAHAM'S POV: THE BED


The ceiling and walls decomposing. Nothing falls on the bed.
Mr. Charles Leeds sleeps with his arm under Mrs. Leeds' pillow.







108.

Mrs. Leeds is on her side. Slowly she starts to rise. She
sees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream.
A silent shot shoves her back to the headboard. Red blood
starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound. We
FLOAT CLOSER. In SLOW MOTION Mr. Leeds starts to rise.
Something massive and silver flashes through the FRAME. He Is
gone. Mirrors explode. Mrs. Leeds was looking at her hand
covered with blood. Now Mrs. Leeds looks up at us. Her face
turns into a smile. Her eyes are silver. A silver light
emanates from her mouth. She smiles at us. She wants us. She
really wants us. Her hand gestures us closer. As we MOVE
CLOSER we hear:

                GRAHAM (O.S.)
      You will be better than anything...
      anything I have ever known. As I
      see me in your eyes.., as I see me
      accepted there. Reflected there in
      mirrors .
           (beat)
      And you, you are the fuel for my
      changing... as this event becomes
      one more step towards what I am
      becoming that is different than what
      I have ever been before...
           (beat)
      As I see me, accepted by you, in the
      silver mirrors of your eyes...

In the silver mirrors of her eyes, Graham sees reflected
there: himself.


INT. LEEDS LIVING ROOM - WIDE

It is empty. The bare floorboards, a dynamic perspective of
lines, go nowhere. O.S. Graham's scream reverberates in the
empty house.
                            CUT TO:


INT. GATEWAY LABS, MAIN DARKROOM- WIDE FROM THE CEILING
DAY

It is pitch-black. In the green safe light we make our the
rollers and pulleys carrying film through the vats of D76
developer and fixer. It is mechanized. There is no one
to maintain it. Distantly on the floor in a far corner we
perceive the shape of a man and reddish glow. The CAMERA
STARTS MOVING towards the shape on the floor. As we get
closer we realize it's Dollarhyde. Something is wrong with
him. ..

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)

      THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE

               DOLLARHYDE
      No.

                RED DRAGON (O.S.)

      THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF
      SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE
      A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE
      ME WHAT I WANT!

               DOLLARHYDE
      No!

By now we're close to his body curled up on the floor in the
sanctuary of the developing room. The red glow emanates
from beneath Dollarhyde's shirt.

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY
      PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH
      THEIR...

               DOLLARHYDE.
      Shut up. Stop. Stop it.

He stands.

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS!
      YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!

                DOLLARHYDE
      I want her! I want her alive...
      I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR
      ME!!!

He starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room.
They form a moire pattern of colors on walls. Some splash
on him and make his shirt smoke.


PHONE

Dollarhyde's unsteady hand takes it off the wall. Be pours
sweat. If the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him,
he doesn't acknowledge it. He punches four numbers.

               DOLLARHYDE
      Reba ...

               REBA (V.O.)
      Francis? Where are you?

               DOLLARHYDE
      The developing room.
           (beat)
      I need to... see you.







110.

                REBA (V.O.)
       I want to see you, too, Francis...
       Should I come over?

                DOLLARHYDE
           (into phone)
       No. Reba...?

                REBA (V.O.)
           (phone filter)
       Are you okay...?

               DOLLARHYDE
           (into phone; getting
           control)
       I'll see you later. All right?

                REBA (V.O.)
           (phone filter)
       You'll come by?

                DOLLARHYDE
           (into phone)
       Yes .

                            CUT TO:


EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - SLOW TRACK PAST DOLLARHYDE'S VAN -
NIGHT

He sits under the tree with the lights out. He is waiting.
Watching. He looks at his watch. Then he hears a car
approach and looks up.


DOLLARHYDE'S POV: GREEN OLDSMOBILE
pulls into Reba's drive.

INT. VAN - DOLLARHME'S FACE

Excited. He starts to get out. Now he stops.

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + RALPH DANDRIDGE

exit the Oldsmobile. He helps Reba out of the car. She
makes her own way up the sidewalk to her door. Reba opens
her door with a key. She turns towards Dandridge.

                DANDRIDGE
       There's something on your face.

He brushes at a speck of dust on Reba's cheek.











111.


INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE
stares. Events are threatening Dollarhyde's fragile stabil-
ity. We don't want this to be happening, we don't want
Dandridge to touch her...



DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DANDRIDGE

We see what Dollarhyde imagines: Dandridge's fingers caress
the soft skin of Reba's face. Reba's expression and mouth
are open and warm to him.


INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S FACE
Blank .

DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DOLLARHYDE

Reba smiles. Her lips part. His finger brushes between her
lips... His hand goes to her breast...



INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S
hand clutches the dash.

PADDED DASH

His fingers pop through the vinyl, gouging deep furrows. We
hear hyperventilating.


EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - REBA + DANDRIDGE

Normal reality. There was no, there is no seduction. No
contact.

               REBA
      What was it?

               DANDRIDGE
      Pollen .

               REBA
      Thanks for the ride.

               DANDRIDGE
      See you tomorrow.

Reba walks into her apartment












112.
RALPH DANDRIDGE
walks back to his car. We are TRACKING WITH Dandridge walk-
ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge.
Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower
face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge's
face. THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter.
He shot Dandridge three times in the heart.



                            CUT TO:


INT. REBA'S DUPLEX - REBA - NIGHT

Moving in the dark. The DOORBELL RINGS. She has unbuttoned
her blouse. Now she goes back to answer the door.

               REBA
      Who is it?

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      It's me.

               REBA
      Who?

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Me.

               REBA
      Francis.. .?

She opens the door and smiles.

               RED DRAGON (O.S.)
      It's not Francis?
           (beat)
      No. Francis is gone. Francis is
      gone forever...

As he steps towards her...


                            CUT TO:


THE MOON

It's full and very large as it dawns over black water that
seems to ripple and be drawn to it. PULL BACK to reveal
we are:


INT. CHICAGO FBI OFFICE - WINDOW + NIGHT SKY - NIGHT

Next to the window we see the Jacobi family in fishing
scene on a monitor. They are on a pier into a small lake
with poles and bobbers. The kids turn back and wave AT us.






113.


               CRAWFORD (O.S.)
           What's important?

The scene changes to a birthday party. The Jacobis are
sitting around a dining table. They are singing.



GRAHAM + CRAWFORD


                GRAHAM
      He changes them into beings that
      accept him... And he needs to see
      the acceptance, In the mirrors.
      I didn't understand the mirrors
      before.
           (beat)
      It's very important.

               CRAWFORD
      'Changes?'

                GRAHAM
      It's a word. Killing them...
           (beat)
      His delusion is: if he sees
      himself accepted enough times, he
      will become as one who has the
      power to be accepted all the time.
           (beat)
      And he would record it somehow. So
      he can see himself received over
      and over again...

                CRAWFORD
      VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

               GRAHAM
      How do I know?!


Graham is intent on the tape. Then:


                GRAHAM
      He's very careful, very... designed
      when he chooses,
           (beat )
      If we find out how he finds them,
      then we'll find him.

                CRAWFORD
      There's no connection between the
      families.

               GRAHAM
      There has to be.





114.


                CRAWFORD
           (exasperated)
      There is none! We've run it
      through the computer a dozen
      times .

Graham's beyond frustration.

                GRAHAM
          (suddenly calm)
      He's a very shy boy...

               CRAWFORD
      What?

               GRAHAM
      Something Lecktor said.

                CRAWFORD
      Let's admit we struck out this
      month. The Gulf Stream's standing
      by. The basic lab stuff is on it.
      You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a
      photographer. Anywhere he hits,
      we can be there in an hour and
      fifteen minutes. We get the call,
      we roll. The scene'll be very
      fresh. ..

               GRAHAM
      It's not over yet.

                CRAWFORD
      It's a foregone conclusion. For
      Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.
      The full moon is tonight.

Graham doesn't answer. He's totally concentrated on the
film.



TV MONITOR: JACOBI FAMILY

Donald Jacobi, big birthday card to the camera. It says:
"Happy Birthday - Follow the ribbon." Camera follows Donald
Jacobi following the ribbon into the basement and the flood-
lights reveal a ten-speed bicycle.

               CRAWFORD
      Will?

                GRAHAM
           (explodes )
      You wanna watch this or what?!

Crawford stares at him. Then he works his way through a
report with a penlight.





115.

TV MONITOR: JACOBI FAMILY

We are outside in the rain. Donald Jacobi brings the bicycle
out. The camera pans past: the padlock on the basement door.
Graham's hand flashes INTO FRAME and slams on the freeze
button.


               GRAHAM
      That's why the boltcutter.

               CRAWFORD
      What's that?

                GRAHAM
      He used a boltcutter to trim the
      branch out of his way. When he
      was watching from the woods. Why
      didn't he use it to go through the
      basement door?

                CRAWFORD
      Because a steel door and deadbolt
      were there when they were killed.

                GRAHAM
      You mean Jacobi put it in between
      when this film was made and when
      he was murdered?

               CRAWFORD
      He had to.


Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy
report on Donald Jacobi.


                GRAHAM
      Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday
      party was April fourteenth.
      Sometime between April fourteenth
      and May third they changed the
      door.
           (beat)
      But you can't see either family's
      door from the street. He wouldn't
      know until he got to the house that
      the padlock wasn't there anymore...


He freezes the Jacobi tape and loads and plays the Leeds
tape :


                GRAHAM
           (intently on the screen )
      From the alley he couldn't have
      seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen
      door .
                (MORE)



116.


               GRAHAM (CONT'D)
      There's a lattice porch back there,
      but he was ready with his glasscutter.
           (beat)
      So he was either casing far ahead and
      we didn't check back far enough or...


MONITOR: LEEDS TAPE

The Leeds' gray Scottie perks up his ears and runs in the
glass kitchen door. The camera pans off the dog to Valerie
Leeds coming in the door: behind her the door is vulnerable
with its big glass pane. Her kids follow her through the
door...

               CRAWFORD
      It's getting late and...

                GRAHAM
          (explodes)
      Don't talk to me!!

Crawford's surprised.



EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM


Watching. Then he grabs the phone and punches numbers.

                GRAHAM
      It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is
      still in the storeroom?

               METCALPE (V.O.)
      Yeah. You know what time it is?

                GRAHAM
      Have one of the guards down there
      call me.

               METCALFE (V.O.)
      If the guy's not asleep...

               GRAHAM
      Do it.

He hangs up on Metcalfe.



VTR MONITORS


Graham's hand freezes the Leeds' rape and plays the Jacobi
tape. The Jacobis' cat moves, jumps on the table.





117.


                       GRAHAM
           (to himself)
      You knew that was the Jacobis'
      cat ...

The Jacobi boy pushes the bicycle out of the basement door
with the padlock.

                GRAHAM
           (to himself)
      You brought a boltcutter... 'cause
      you thought there was a padlock...

Next Mrs. 3acobi -- warm, smiling -- watches Donald ride
the bike. Now Graham plays the Leeds' tape, too. The dog
runs to camera...


                GRAHAM
           (to himself)
      And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a
      collar... But you know it's the
      Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!

His tail wagging, his tongue out; he's a friendly dog. Mrs.
Leeds enters and pets him.

                GRAHAM
          (to himself)
      See the woman?

Crawford is staring at Graham strangely. This is why
Crawford drafted him. But Crawford doesn't look like he
wants to be alone in the same room with Graham anymore...

                GRAHAM
      The bloom on the woman. You can
      almost feel her.  You can see her
      again and again. Anytime you want.
           (beat)
      The doggy doesn't have a collar.
      But you know the Leeds' dog, don't
      you?
           (beat)
      And you know the Jacobi cat. And
      the padlock on the door and you
      know you need a boltcutter and
      every other goddamn thing 'cause...
           (shouts)
      YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS!
           (beat)
      Haven't you, my man?


The PHONE RINGS. Crawford answers. His attention is riveted
on Graham.


                CRAWFORD
      It's the guard in the storeroom.



118.


                GRAHAM
           (to Crawford)
      We want the cans the Jacobi home
      movies came in.
           (beat)
      They're in the far corner of the
      room under the windows.

                CRAWFORD
           (into phone)
      There's some film cans in the far
      corner of the room underneath one
      of the windows.


Crawford is very quiet.


               CRAWFORD
      He found them...


Graham pushes aside the videotape sleeve and picks up the
Leeds' home-movie can.


                GRAHAM
           (reads label)
      What it's going to say on the
      Jacobi film can is the same as it
      says on the Leeds' film can:
      Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.

                CRAWFORD
           (into phone)
      Is there a label on the Jacobi can
      that says what lab processed it?


Crawford hears. Then he deflates.


                CRAWFORD
           (to Graham)
      No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...

                GRAHAM 
      Have him peel the top label back.

                CRAWPORD
           (into phone)
      See if there's another label
      underneath.

Crawford hears, Graham's watching him.

               GRAHAM
      It does, doesn't it?





119.


               CRAWFORD
           (punches another
           number)
      I want a chopper on the roof in
      three minutes. To Meigs Field.
           (bear )
      At Meigs have them warn up and
      flight-prep the Gulf Stream.

Graham's already out the door. Crawford races after him.

                            CUT TO:

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - REBA - NIGHT

has been placed on the kitchen table. It is chrome and
pale yellow Formica. Her face is bruised and swollen from
where Dollarhyde hit her. She feels, around on the bed.
She's very frightened. She's trying to control herself...

               REBA
      ... You're scaring me with this.

There's no answer. We don't know if there's anyone else in
the room.

               REBA
           (searching).
      Am I alone in this room? Are you
      here...
           (shrill)
      Why are you doing this?!

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (even)
      Some remarkable events have
      happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.
      Do you know what I'm talking about?


Reba shakes her head.


               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (in a low voice)
      Two groups of people were changed.
      Leeds. And Jacobi. The police
      think they were murdered.
           (beat)
      Do you know what they call the
      being that visited these people?
      You can say.

               REBA
      The Tooth...

In a flash Dollarhyde grips her mouth, shutting off the
sound.





120.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
           (low)
      Think carefully and answer
      correctly.

His arm exits FRAME.

               REBA
      It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.

               DOLLARHYDE (O.S.)
      Francis did a thing for you today
      so I couldn't have you. And he
      was wrong.
           (beat)
      I AM THE DRAGON!
          (beat)
      Give me your hand.


Reba's hand is gripped by Dollarhyde's. He brings her
fingers up to his face. For the first time in this scene
we are seeing Dollarhyde's face. The fanged dentures are
in his mouth. Dollarhyde makes Reba's hand feel his teeth.
O.S., we hear Reba start whimpering and try to pull away.
Dollarhyde holds her hand there.


               DOLLARHYDE
      Now you know how the Dragon
      kills...

The Gulf Stream approaches and races past us at its cruising

the tarmac to the squad cars. Squad cars race out of the

She stands there, squeezing into the corner, trying to make
herself disappear. Then she senses and freezes as a rabbit
who is hunted and at a certain point, freezes...


DOLLARHYDE

stands four feet from her, just staring. Then he walks
from the room.

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S LIVING ROOM - DOLLARHYDE

puts "INNAGADDADAVIDA" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the

Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened.

smashes. His image SHATTERS with the mirrored glass.



DOLLARHYDE'S

forearm destroys the glass shower door. He rips the metal
frame from the walls. He snaps the mitred framework. The
aluminum frame members have sharp 45 degree points. He
takes them and the shards of mirror and leaves for the

               GRAHAM
      Go on to the house...

He obeys Graham and floors it. Graham puts his black plastic
briefcase on his lap and extracts the .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
He starts to load 6 matte-black, blunt-nosed Glaser Safety
Slugs. He fumbles them in the swaying car. The bullets
fall to the floor.


CAR FLOOR

Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting. Graham's
fingers enter and pick them up. We FOLLOW the rounds as
they slip into the cylinder.


CRAWFORD
is staring at Graham's blankness.

               CRAWFORD
      Will?

               GRAHAM
          (sharp )
      What?

               CRAWFORD
      You're not going to need that.
      Because we're going in careful and
      slow and secure a perimeter and a
      St. Louis PD Swat team is going to
      take him. Not us.

               ST. LOUIS PD DRIVER
      That's it up ahead...



THEIR POV: DOLLARHYDE'S PROPERTY

The house is set back a half mile from the road. Access to
the drive is blocked by a locked cattle gate.

We don't know why they are slowing down.


TIRES

spray the gumbo mud out of the furrows. The forward momentum
of the car slows until it completely stops. The tires spin

GRAHAM

spills out and starts running for the house and the orchard
a quarter mile away. Crawford follows.


                            CUT TO:


EXT. DOLLARHYDE ORCHARD - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD

running towards the house through the trees. Branches
slap at them. Ahead, the orchard will parallel the house.
They can get to within 25 yards using the trees as cover.

                CRAWFORD
           (into radio)
      Get the roadblocks set on Route
      Three! There's an access road to
      the back of the house. That ought
      to be a second team's approach.
      Will Graham and I are in an orchard
      due west of the house.

                GRAHAM
      How far away's the back-up?

               CRAWFORD
      Three minutes.

Graham gestures Crawford to a position with a front 3/4 view
of the house.

               GRAHAM
      I'll cover the back.

               CRAWFORD
      Stay in the trees.


As we TRACK with Graham through the trees towards the back,
beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving
past. The windows are large. At the back -- like a ramp --
are two storm cellar doors.

FRONTAL: GRAHAM

in the dark shadows of the trees. He seems to float: through
the branches and slows and settles quietly. Then the ex-
pression on Will Graham's face starts to change...


GRAHAM'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW

Shadows. A light comes on. Then the figure of Reba is
swung out of a corner past the window...


               GRAHAM
           (resigned whisper
           into radio)
      There's somebody in the house, Jack

      Wait for the back-up! Will?

INT. DOLLARHYDE'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + REBA - NIGHT

On the right we see Dollarhyde's right arm with the aluminum
shafts... Beyond them, THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Graham has
stepped out from the tree line. He stands on the grass.
He looks helpless. His gun hangs idly at his side.


CLOSE: GRAHAM

It's his worst nightmare. About what he's seeing:

                GRAHAM
          (low)
      ... stop it.


INT. DOLLARHME'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + BEYOND HIM 007 THE
WINDOW: GRAHAM

We and Graham see Dollarhyde's arm arc back for an uppercutting
thrust into Reba. Dollarhyde's left hand clutching her dress,
raises her two feet up the wall. And now Graham starts running
forward. And his face is distorted and he's shouting:


                GRAHAM
           (roars)
      STOP IT!!!

Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see:




128.


WINDOW + GRAHAM
-- his arms across his face and his body angled sideways
-- CRASHES through the glass.


DOLLARHYDE

catching Graham's momentum -- throws him across the room.

GRAHAM

CRASHES off the fridge which opens and spills and hits the
floor as...

DOLLARHYDE

ROARS and grabs his 9mm from the kitchen table.


GRAHAM'S FACE

is lacerated from the glass. He sees his own blood on the
floor. He struggles to rise. The first thing up is the
big bore of the .44. It FIRES as if it had its own mind.


DOLLARHYDE'S

left shoulder EXPLODES.


GRAHAM

bleeding, brings the .44 down from the recoil of the first shot.
Now, up on one knee, he FIRES FOUR more rounds into Dollarhyde.



OVERHEAD: THE KITCHEN FLOOR


Graham stands and walks to Dollarhyde. Reba is collapsed in
the corner. Dollarhyde it more exploded from within than
shot. Graham starts to raise the gun...

INT. MOTEL ROOM - WIDE REAR SHOT ON GRAHAM - DAY

We will only see the rear of Will Graham sitting alone on the
side of the bed in the alienating motel room. His head is
bandaged.

      Hello.


INTERCUT WITH:


INT. MONTANA RANCH HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOLLY - DAY


               MOLLY
      I was out in the garden. Mama came
      out and told me when she saw it on
      TV. Why didn't you call me?

               GRAHAM
      Mama was probably asleep.

               MOLLY
      Will? Are you okay?

               GRAHAM
      Not too bad. I'll be here a few
      days longer.
           (beat)
      I want to see you.

               MOLLY
      I want to see you, too.

               GRAHAM
      Today's Wednesday. By Friday I
      ought to...

               MOLLY
      Mama has all Kevin's uncles and
      aunts coming down from Cheyenne
      next week and...

               GRAHAM
      Come home with me.

               MOLLY
      Will, they never get to see Kevin
      and a few more days...

               GRAHAM
      What's this Mama shit?

               MOLLY
      It's what Kevin called her when he
      was little...





130.

               GRAHAM
      What's the problem, Molly?

               MOLLY
           (pause)
      I came up here after Kevin's father
      died .
           (beat)
      They were very supportive and
      helped me adjust. I got myself
      together. I've gotten myself
      together now, too.

               GRAHAM
      Small difference: I'm not dead,
      yet .

               MOLLY
      Will?
          (no response)
      You could come up here.

               GRAHAM
      They don't want me up there. Every
      time they look at me I remind them...
      If they thought about it, they'd
      want you. Bur all they really want's
      the boy. And they'll take you.
      But they don't want to see me...

               MOLLY
      That's not true.

               GRAHAM
      Okay. They're full of shit and
      they make me sick...

Then no one says anything.

               MOLLY
      Maybe we should give it some time...

               GRAHAM
      Yeah. That's great. A little
      time.
           (beat
      I tell you what, buckaroo...
           (beat)
      See you around.


Graham slams down the phone. Still half-immersed in a
psychotic landscape of the mind, Graham's psyche resonates
with echoes of Dollarhyde. Now he gets up and walks out of
the room leaving the door open. Outside is only the deserted
parking lot.

It's open plan. The dining area and kitchen are raised.
The Sherman family are engaged in 7:00 PM suburban family
chaos: GEORGE SHERMAN is trying to watch the news. He
hollers up the stairs for his daughter to turn down her
stereo. His 11-year-old son, FRED, at the dining room
table is supposed to be doing homework. Instead he rolls
up balls of paper and does jump shots from his chair into
the wastepaper can,

Tina opens it.

screams.

GEORGE SHEBMAN

runs to the door. In a WIDER SHOT, we see there is a sho-
gun resting inside the door jamb. It's within reach or
Sherman's hand. We see why Tina Sherman screamed:

WILL GRAHAM'S FACE

is pulled down slightly on the left side, making his left
eye moon-shaped. There is a half-healed wound and butter-
fly bandage where Dollarhyde stabbed him. He is standing
in a black raincoat with a black hat.


               SHERMAN
      What do you want?

               GRAHAM
      Are you George Sherman?

His wife starts to come forward.


               GRAHAM
      No, that's okay...
           (pause)
      How are you?

There's a searching look on Graham's face. Totally strange.


                SHERMAN
      We're fine. Fine. We're all well.
      We're okay!

                SHERMAN
      I can't thank you enough, I..,

Graham shakes his head. He doesn't want to be thanked.
No one knows what to say. Graham looks at them:




133.
SHERMAN FAMILY
standing in awkward places. They ate nothing special. They
are normal human beings living their lives. To Graham they
are very special: they are alive.


                GRAHAM
      I just wanted to stop by and... see
      you... I guess. That's all.


Graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory.
Then he nods. Then he leaves.


GEORGE SHERMAN

closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He
didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.

stands as she comes near him. The aqua highlights of the
water eat into their figures as they look at each other.
Molly touches the wounded side of his face. Then:

Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea.
The highlights burn out sections of the two people.

               MOLLY
      So how'd we do...?

Graham looks at her. He touches the side of her cheek and
her hair. She pushes against his hand with her face to make
closer contact.

      We did okay.

Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm

kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant
atoms.

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
     THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.




                                                           FADE IN:

     THE SCREEN

     Stygean darkness.

     Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
     them.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. SEWER SYSTEM

     Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels.

     A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld
     UV lamps.

     The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,
     their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT
     VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-
     CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.

     The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.

     NIGHT-VISION POV

     Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some
     kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.

     THE TEAM OF FIGURES

     From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a
     flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.

     She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty
     small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach
     with a different BARCODE on their back.

     JUDAS ROACHES.

     She kneels and opens the

     CASE

     TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide
     through into the area.

     THE NEARBY ROACHES

     react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin
     to stream toward the Judases.

     Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.

     They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach
     the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them
     off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.

     LATER

     A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and
     attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.

     REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms
     of the roaches, now all DEAD.

     The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other
     disposal drums.

     At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:
     the bar-coded Judas Roaches.

     In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted
     by the chains through the manhole to

     EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY

     MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.

     Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink
     everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped
     dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send
     the cars on crosstown detours.

     Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
     dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked
     in a military phalanx.

     A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
     middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.

     Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches
     and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.

     The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is
     off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.

     An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.

                          PETER (OS)
                How we doing?

     She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A
     HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the
     DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's
     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.

                          SUSAN
                We'll see...

     He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,
     shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him.

     Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
     by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.

     THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.

     A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan
                like a thief in the night, claiming its
                first hundred victims before it was even
                classified.

     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT

     We FLOAT through a long hospital ward.

     Past ROWS of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in
     the dark like cocoons of light.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Most were children under ten.

     TRACK past tents.  BODIES OF SMALL CHILDREN inside, wrapped
     in white sheets, hooked up to IVs or breathing apparatus.
     Skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.

     BELLOWS of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.

     IMAGE RESOLVES TO A VIDEO ON A SCREEN.

     PULL BACK to reveal a number of SCREENS, each with a
     different set of images.  We are in a NEWS VAN.   A
     TECHNICIAN and DIRECTOR sit watching.

     The voice belongs to an ANCHORMAN who's now overimposed.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Only after the numbers had reached into
                the thousands were officials able to
                identify the carrier of the deadly
                infection...

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut to three.

     The Technician manipulates the controls.  On another screen
     we see them cut to STOCK NEWS FOOTAGE: regular cockroaches,
     crawling on garbage.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Blattida Germanica.  The common
                cockroach.

                          DIRECTOR
                     (To a RUNNER)
                Tell them we're ready for a live feed.

     EXT. OUTSIDE VAN - CITY HALL - DUSK

     The runner exits the News Van.  Other such vehicles parked
     nearby.  A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of
     PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.

     Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...

                          REPORTER 1
                ...an insect that has proven virtually
                immune to chemical control...

     MOVE past them to further inside of the perimeter...

     INT. AUDITORIUM - CITY HALL

     A NEWS CONFERENCE in progress.  A packed house.  T.V.
     monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so. In the audience, the
     MAYOR OF NEW YORK and various CITY OFFICIALS, listening to

     Peter, speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of
     a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy.

     ON A TV MONITOR

     While Peter talks, a news title appears at the bottom of the
     screen: PETER TYLER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

                          PETER
                     (wrapping up)
                ...in Nature, evolution is a long,
                leisurely conversation between an
                organism and its environment. We,
                however, did not have the luxury of
                time...

     Susan is waiting in the wings. She observes the audience.

     She notices that the entire front row is composed of CHILDREN
     who have survived Strickler's.  Leg and arm braces, facial
     scarring...

     He nods at Susan, who takes the podium, adjusting her jacket,
     slightly ill at ease in her business suit.  She clears her
     throat, speaks softly.

                          SUSAN
                With the aid of genetic labs throughout
                the country, we recombined cockroach DNA
                with genetic information from termites
                and mantids. We were able to create a
                biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if
                you will...

     She places a clear container on the podium for all to see.

                          SUSAN
                Blattida Traditor.

     CU CONTAINER

     One of the Judas roaches skitters about in the container.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                The "Judas Roach".

     Cameras FLASH.  MURMURS from the audience.

                          SUSAN
                The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers,
                with a short life-span and heightened
                pheromone emission.

     On the back row she can see some ecological hand-painted
     signs being raised in silent protest. She stumbles for a
     second, then resumes her speech.

                          SUSAN
                The female is basically a sexual magnet;
                common males travelled miles and fought
                for the right to mate with them.

     The audience is rapt.

                          SUSAN
                When they did, they took away something
                else we added -- a hormone, passed
                through sexual congress that causes their
                metabolism to go into overdrive.  No
                matter what their food intake, they
                starved to death in a matter of hours.

     Now Peter takes the mic.

                          PETER
                We've achieved almost total eradication
                of the roach population.  As of today,
                the disease has been officially
                contained.

     A STANDING OVATION starts and is carried on as we...

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SUSAN

     in a tub in a dark bathroom. Her business suit crumpled
     on the bathroom floor.  SOUND of a TV outside.

                          PETER (OS)
                Sus, come on.  You're missing it.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     Nothing grand.  Peter in his shorts at a TV with shitty
     reception.  He adjusts the disgruntled cable box.

     He is seen over the TV, giving his address.

                          PETER
                Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping
                this.
                     (Out.)
                Susan, come on.  It's really good this
                time. I got most of the lines out.
                     (No response.)
                Sus?

     Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and
     two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM

                          PETER
                Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came
                and went and all we got was bad
                cable...

     Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.

                          PETER
                Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?

     He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it
     up, puts it up on the hanger.

                          PETER
                A shame.  You looked great tonight.

                          SUSAN
                Please.

                          PETER
                You did!

     He sits by the tub.

                          SUSAN
                Do you think we did the right thing?

                          PETER
                Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

                          SUSAN
                You know what I mean...

     Peter pours some champagne into the cups.

                          SUSAN
                We did no impact evaluation.  The
                consequences of...

                          PETER
                     (sighs)
                Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?

     We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV.

                          NEWSREADER (TV)
                ...a flawless strategy which has stopped
                a potential epidemic in its tracks...

                          PETER
                You hear that?  Flawless.

                          SUSAN
                We just don't know.

     He offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it.

                          PETER
                We know we saved lives.

     He sits closer to her.

                          PETER
                There're gonna be a lot of kids running
                around next year because of you.

     Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her.

                          PETER
                Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple
                of 'em'll be ours.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiling now)
                We're down to a "couple" now, huh?

     She pats the water, beckoning.

                          PETER
                Oh, I don't know. People are beginning
                to talk about us...

     Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan
     shakes her head, laughs ruefully.

                          SUSAN
                Don't worry, I'll save your honor.
                Maybe I'll even marry you.

     She reaches over, kisses him.

                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                        FADE IN TO:

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT

     The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.

     ALPHABET CITY STREETS

     Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking
     on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy
     layer of rain.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER

     A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made
     of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.

     CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.

     WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,
     thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild
     with terror.

     He looks back down the steps.

     Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex
     shadows on the wall.

     Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.

     The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.

     Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door
     shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...
     something inhuman, determined to break through.

     The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.

     On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to
     grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.

     He searches wildly for a possible escape.

     He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the
     sidewalk.

     Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the
     surrounding concrete.

     WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
     SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.

     The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the
     adjoining building...

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV

     Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
     suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a
     tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is
     being painted over.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.
     LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge
     gives.

     He CRIES OUT in terror.

     The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make
     it?

     He takes a few steps back, a few more...

     Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood
     and rain.

     THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.

     Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things
     onto the curtain of rain.

     Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself
     to the catwalk.

     It's too far.

     He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards
     loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He
     bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a
     loose board to save himself from falling.

     The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the
     edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.

     He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push
     with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.

     BELOW

     Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.

     CU HANDS

     The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.

     FEET

     The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to
     find a purchase on the wet brick wall-

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'
     model.  He looks up above him, sees something-

                          CHINESE PREACHER
                No.  Please, God, no!

     A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.
     Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely
     on one end.

     HANDS

     The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the
     wet wood.

     His hands paw the air.

     WIDER

     For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems
     suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.

     THE GROUND

     Impact. His body cracks the pavement.

     Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.

     We CRANE to reveal

     A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET

     CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the
     Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.

     He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.

     APARTMENT

     It's a small one-bedroom apartment.

     An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.
     MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,
     benign face.

     All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the
     table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.

     A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,
     standing by the window is

     CHUY

     HIS P.O.V.

     We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed
     figure in a swirl of color.

     Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.

     CHUY

                          CHUY
                     (a whisper)
                Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...

     He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
     wire into shape.

     THE PUDDLE OF PAINT

     around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,
     and across the neon sign...

     CHUY

     hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.

     His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
     change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
     his eyes.

     ACROSS THE ROOFTOP

     We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's
     attention.

     TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...

     The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins
     moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps
     forward and drops out of frame.

     CHUY

     His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
     arc.

     Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
     a better view.

     GROUND LEVEL

     The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the
     rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.

     CHUY

     We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other
     noise FADES AWAY.

     Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.

     He begins to click them together.

     Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only
     problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
     this hole.

     CHUY

     watches, still clicking with his spoons.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY

     is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the
     thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
     against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.

     There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY
     VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body
     like a rag doll.

     CHUY

     His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear
     terrible cracking and scraping sounds.

     THE WINDOW

     The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the
     hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of
     the opening.

     CHUY

     watches, still fascinated.

                          CHUY
                     (very low)
                Funny, funny shoes...

     He starts a new wire sculpture.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

     Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the
     Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the
     windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.

     Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his
     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his
     stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.

                          PETER
                Excuse me, ladies...

     Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past
     them.

     EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER

     Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a
     water fountain.

     As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the
     sidewalk.

     The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.

     Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points
     to a manhole cover set among the bushes.

     Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.

     Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.

     GRAFFITI

     A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged
     lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is
     little more than a malignant blotch.

     INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY

     A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS --
     most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece
     representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a
     punkish young Indian research assistant.

     Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale
     clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the
     model's mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                ...no, guys, these have to fit
                perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let
                me tell you why. Insects have no
                hands. All they have is this set of
                mandibles.

     She grabs the outer mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                See?  This little piggy will grab the
                prey.

     Then unfolds a second set...

                          SUSAN
                Then this little piggy will tear it
                in half...

     And a third!!!

                          SUSAN
                ...and this little one will grind it
                to a pulp and push it in... all the
                way into the mouth.  These are
                precision tools here. Can you
                remember that?

     The guys nod.

                          SUSAN
                Good.  Then get it right.

     A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,
     revealing...

     ...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging
     sweats. He smiles at Susan.

     EXHIBITS

     Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a
     KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ.

                          PETER
                     (teasing)
                "Baby in a bottle..."

     He gives it to Susan.

                          SUSAN
                Don't tease.

     Around them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff,
     as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an "ARCHITECTS OF NATURE"
     banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a
     honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.

                          PETER
                You know where they get this
                fertility stuff?  They extract it
                from the urine of menopausal Italian
                nuns.

                          SUSAN
                     (laughs)
                Monks bottle their own wine. Don't
                they?

     She gently touches her belly.

                          SUSAN
                Trust me. I've never been this late.
                Never.

     She shakes the bottle.

                          SUSAN
                If nun's pee is what it takes...

     Peter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a
     larvae model from a pile on the floor.

                          SUSAN
                You were the one who ran around with
                ice in his underwear, don't forget
                that.

                          PETER
                Don't get kinky here...

     Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on
     the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits
     perfectly inside.

                          PETER
                Okay, meet me out front.
                     (to Susan)
                I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five.
                see you tonight.

                          SUSAN
                I'll be late.

     He kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group
     working on that sculpture.

                          SUSAN
                Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks
                like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are
                supposed to be made of dirt and
                excretions...

                          SIRI
                     (a wicked smile)
                Just like Trump Tower, then.

     EXT. STREET

     A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic
     jam.

     INT. VAN

     Peter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured,
     can-do guy -- drives.

                          JOSH
                ...So I say "buddy, you have every
                violation in the book.  Gimme one
                good reason not to close you down."
                You know what the Kraut says to me?

     In the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging
     sweats and into his worksuit.

                          JOSH
                The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

                          PETER
                     (distractedly)
                Selling your sould for a fistful of
                carbohydrates...

                          JOSH
                Not just any carbohydrates, mind you.
                It was like being on the receiving
                end of some kind of transcendent oral
                sex.
                     (honks furiously)
                We should get a strobe on this thing.
                Maybe even a siren.

                          PETER
                Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can
                yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all
                going to die!"

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY

     The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse
     where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out.

     COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH
     badge.

                          JOSH
                Health Department...

     The cops let them pass.

                          PETER
                You really love flashing that thing,
                don't you?

                          JOSH
                Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?

     Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry.

                          PETER
                Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were
                the first on the scene?

                          WOYCHEK
                     (gestures to Rice)
                We were both on patrol, saw this paint
                mess. Then I looked through that cellar
                window. We both did...

                          PETER
                You gone in?

                          WOYCHEK
                No. We waited.

                          PETER
                Good.

     Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.

     Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE
     FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                Get the EMT's in there, now.

     LATER

     PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast.

     Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to
     Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of
     shoes.

     Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.

                          MANNY
                C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.
                     (discreetly crossing himself)
                Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.

     He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.

     JOSH

     uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy
     stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses.

     INT. CELLAR

     Peter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar,
     illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every
     door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty
     padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene.

     In sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny
     metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with
     a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character.

     Josh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads:
     PROUDLY MADE IN USA.

                          PETER
                Jesus.

     His light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE
     IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall.

     INT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK

     Carrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri
     ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons,
     just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever.

                          SIRI
                She used a baster.

     Susan looks at her.

                          SIRI
                Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a
                turkey baster.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, Jesus.

     She tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but
     it rises just a little too far.

                          SUSAN
                Come on, darlin'...

     Susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls
     level to the floor.

                She kept it under her bed. Thing is,
                it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to
                hide it from her husband, but...

     A pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor
     outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe
     box sit beside them.

                          SUSAN
                What's this?

                Oh, right... They been here since noon.
                I told them you're real busy.

     Susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her.

     Ricky raises and shakes the paper bag.

                Cost a dollar just to look.

                          DAVIS
                It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a
                little...

     Siri impatiently points at the wall clock-

                Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars
                for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some
                tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you
                catch will be in better shape.

                          DAVIS
                Bug's almost dead anyway.

     Susan holds out two five dollar bills.  The boys can't
     resist.  Davis grabs the money-

                          DAVIS
                Thanks, lady.

     Ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box, then
     follows Davis out.

     Siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it.

                          SIRI
                Ten dollars?

     Susan places all the kid's items -including the shoebox- in
     a wastebasket.

                Alphabet City kids- there's much worse
                things they could be selling.

     PARAMEDICS are leading a number of ill CHINESE IMMIGRANTS up
     from the cellar door seen earlier.  Many are brought out on

                it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll
                quarantine them a week just to make sure.

                          JOSH
                Immigration's gonna love you for that.

                          PETER
                Tell them to send flowers to the
                usual address.

     INT. SWEAT SHOP. BASEMENT

     Peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway.

     BASEMENT SHOWERS

     A tiled nightmare. Concentration camp-cozy. A pile of old,
     rusting sewing machines clutter the floor, spilling
     oxide to a central grate.

                          JOSH
                Two shifts, people rotating from bed to
                work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart
                hell, here.

     Josh swats a fly.

                          PETER
                Did they get the sleazebag who owns this
                place?

                          JOSH
                Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people
                from Yunan. Slave labor...
                     (eyes his notebook)
                Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the
                flophouse fronting for them. No sign of
                him.

     An overhead door is opened. Daylight streams in. Peter spots
     YANG, an Asian cop, talking to a CHINESE WOMAN lying on a
     stretcher which hasn't been moved yet.  She is hollow-eyed,
     near death.  Her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for
     dear life.

                          PETER
                Tell her she's going to be alright.
                We'll take care of her.

     Peter kneels next to her, looking at her and nodding while
     Yang translates. The woman mutters again, tears of fear in
     her eyes.  Yang shakes his head.

                          YANG
                She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark
                Angels" are coming for her. She says
                they took some of her people away.

                          PETER
                Dark Angels?

                          YANG
                     (Shrugs.)
                Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man.
                They come up with some wacky stuff.

     They pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door
     and into an

     ALLEY

     The stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle, its lights
     flashing. Unseen by them, on a brick wall, nearly buried by
     graffiti, is a crude DRAWING.

     It is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The
     OVERCOAT MAN.

     INT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE

     Susan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount
     BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the
     exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window.

     Their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and
     designs of the insects are beautiful.

     We understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan
     works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the
     wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner.

     A PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat.

     She takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     On the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE
     TONIGHT. PETE.

     Susan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window.

     There is a loud, angry BUZZING sound.

                          SUSAN
                Siri?
                     (louder)
                Siri?!

     Siri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     The BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and
     mounting implements till we come to rest...

     ...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles
     wildly inside.

                          SIRI
                ...the fuck?

     Susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It
     vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves
     inside.

     She slowly opens the lid.

     The bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded
     newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be
     spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's
     nest. She moves her free hand closer.

                          SUSAN
                     (To Siri)
                Can you...?

     Suddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the
     shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute
     pieces of paper fly through the air!!

     Susan slaps the lid back down.

                          SUSAN
                     (a scared whisper)
                Could you...help me...?

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     Siri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork
     dissecting board.

                          SUSAN
                I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to
                pin it down, okay?

                          SIRI
                What is it?

                          SUSAN
                I have no idea.  Are you ready?

     Siri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the
     nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing
     its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance
     FOAMING out of its body.

                          SIRI
                Oh my God...

     Susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard.

     Siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the
     tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider
     trapping a sparrow.

                          SIRI
                Shit!! Get it!  Get it!

     SNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger.

     Susan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously,
     like a crazy LP record.

     Susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more
     pins to secure it down.

                          SUSAN
                     (Noticing Siri's hand)
                It bit you.

                          SIRI
                No shit.

     SUSAN

     leans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown,
     flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed.

     It squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh
     overhead light.

                          SUSAN
                This wing configuration. I've
                never...

                          SIRI
                     (looking at her injury)
                Fuck! It broke the skin...

                          SUSAN
                And they're not fully developed.  This
                thing's not even an adult.

     The nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the
     steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly.

                          SUSAN
                My God.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Susan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at

     THE NYMPH'S TORSO

     where a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                It's breathing.

     SIRI

     shakes her head.

                          SIRI
                That's impossible.  Insects don't...

                          SUSAN
                I know.
                     (Picks up a SCALPEL)
                Help me get a sample.

     Susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg.

     The nymph CLICKS nervously.

                          SUSAN
                Hold on, big guy, hold on...

     She traps the nymph down and CUTS THE LEG OFF.

     A painful, agonized BUZZ echoes around the room.

                                                            CUT TO:

     MONITOR

     Susan attaches the insect's leg to a samll holder. It is
     frozen in a swirl of dry ice.

     The brittle leg is then mounted in a LASER MICROTOME. Bit by
     bit, the machine executes MICROSCOPIC WAFER CUTS. Siri is
     making slides out of each section.

     A series of MICROPHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES flash onto the screen.
     In the background we hear the high-pitched BUZZ-

     We see the lights from the mounting room through a glass
     brick wall.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the nymph slowly squirming in the FG, then RACK FOCUS
     to the rain-spattered WINDOW.

     Suddenly the OVERCOAT MAN is standing on the windowsill!

     The window is lifted effortlesly from the outside.

     SUSAN

     prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear
     slide.

     Reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving
     across the room.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN

     seen only through rippled glass and reflections, moves
     through the lab.

     His body STEAMS lightly from the rain. His movements are
     quirky, spastic.

     The man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity.

     He comes to the nymph, pinned and mutilated on the worktable.
     The nymph CLICKS and CHITTERS excitedly, as if communicating
     with the man.

     He looks up at the worklight.  It seems to bother him.

     WHUMP!!! In a blur of motion, he SMASHES the light bulb.

     SUSAN

     watches the smear slide.  The blue droplets begin to CHANGE
     COLOR once in contact with the leg section...

                          SUSAN
                Hold on a second...

     ...slowly turning a deep green.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Then, THREE LARGE BEETLES fly into the room.

     Siri looks at Susan. Susan gets up, hesitant, signals for
     Siri to stay.

     We FOLLOW Susan into the mounting room.

     SUSAN'S POV

     She walks in, barely able to see her hand in front of her
     face.

     The window facing the street is wide open, rain blowing in.

     Something CRUNCHES under her feet.  She bends down, looks.

     She's stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb.

     The floor is alive with various INSECTS -- crawling, hopping,
     flying away from their displays, which have been opened.

     The nymph is gone from the board!

     She looks under the work table the nymph was on.

     We LOWER as we TRACK BACK with her.  Something is folded up
     in the corner of the ceiling behind her, camouflaged in the
     shadows, clinging impossibly to the wall.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

     He lowers himself with silent grace.

     Susan whirls.

     WHOOSH! A GUST OF WIND! A FLUTTERING SHADOW OFF THE WINDOW!

     Silence.

                          SIRI (O.S.)
                Susan?

     Susan GASPS, startled.  We SHIFT to see Siri at the door.

                          SUSAN
                Call security.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain.

     Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME

     Chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like
     figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE
     FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere.

     Manny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe
     polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame.

     He puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a
     pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV.

                          MANNY
                Not too little, not too much. You rub it
                in, around and around like this. Let the
                leather take it.

     Manny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued
     and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under
     his tongue.

                          MANNY
                You watching? You should learn to
                work the shoes. You're good with your
                hands...

     Manny shoots a glance over to his grandson.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...you gonna get all wet.

     Chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street.

                          MANNY
                Did you look at the story book I got you?

     Manny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK.

                          MANNY
                Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that,
                Chico?  "Friends"?

     Nothing from Chuy.

     CHUY'S POV - STREET

     The building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the
     entrance.

                          MANNY (OS)
                A friend is the one you can trust.  When
                you are with a friend, no matter where in
                the world, you are at home.

     A FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain
     toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible
     in the rain.

                          MANNY
                In this city. A friend is a hard thing to
                find...

     CHUY

     His face shows a bit of animation.

                          CHUY
                Funny Shoes...

     Manny looks up from the book.

                          CHUY
                Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Manny comes over, looks out.

     THEIR POV

     The figure has disappeared into the dark front of the
     boarded-up building.

     MANNY AND CHUY

                          MANNY
                No one is there. Is empty.

     Chuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his.

                          MANNY
                Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on
                the cross, but that is not a holy place.
                You understand?

     Chuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't.

                          MANNY
                Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in
                your head, eh?

     He pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy
     turns back to stare at the street.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes...

     EXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war
     building. Josh and Peter climb out.

     Peter is reviewing a roster.

                          PETER
                Josh, what was Immigration's
                countdown?

     Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes
     and running shoes.

                          JOSH
                Thirty-three workers.

     Peter hands him the roster.

                          PETER
                There are thirty five listed in the
                reverend Wong's roster...

                          JOSH
                Shit.

     Peter walks up the front steps.

                          PETER
                Remember what that woman said, about
                people being taken? Check with the
                copsin the area.

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Peter enters the apartment, which has long since been
     remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly
     better reception.

                          PETER
                Sus?

     No answer.  He notices the dining room table is filled with
     yellowed FILES, all marked JUDAS TRADITOR.

                          PETER
                     (Looks around once again)
                Susan?

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

     Peter comes in to find Susan sitting in a chair before a
     dryer, quietly watching laundry whirl within.

                          PETER
                     (Regarding the laundry.)
                Thought it was my week for that.

                          SUSAN
                     (Shrugs.)
                I needed to think. It was either this
                or the weather channel.

     Peter walks over, kisses her.  He notices an open book of
     INSECT MORPHOLOGY on her lap. There's a FULL COLOR
     PHOTOGRAPH of an OOTHECA -- an insect eggcase.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

     Peter folds laundry into his/her piles.  Susan paces.

                          SUSAN
                This thing was the size of my fist,
                Peter!! That's off the charts!

                          PETER
                Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

                          SUSAN
                Don't you get it? It's more than
                that.

     Peter takes a bedsheet. Susan helps him fold it.

                          SUSAN
                You know why insects don't grow larger?
                Because they don't have a complex
                respiratory system. What I saw did. It
                had lungs.

     Peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  The two
     begin to fold it together.

                          SUSAN
                Evolution doesn't work that fast.
                Something pushed that thing to take the
                leap. We need to find another specimen.

                          PETER
                We?

     As they fold the sheet, they move closer together.

                          SUSAN
                I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.

     The folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to
     face. Susan finishes folding herself.

                          SUSAN
                There's only two species who match the
                enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant
                in the Amazon...

     She has his full attention now.

                          SUSAN
                The other we released here two years ago.

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - AVENUE B - DAY

     A TAXI CAB makes a U turn and cruises on.

     INT. CAB

     Susan ignores the yakking Armenian DRIVER as she scans
     the buildings and empty lots-

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                Avenue B... again! Maybe you got
                wrong letter, uh?

     The cabbie looks up at a Manhattan street map glued over
     his head on the roof of the cab.

                          SUSAN
                Keep going. We'll tell you when to
                stop...

                          PETER
                Maybe they lied to you.

                          SUSAN
                Even if they did... that's all we
                have, isn't it?

     The cab cruises past the tenement buildings, nondescript
     stores, junked cars and rubble-strewn lots. It stops
     before a traffic light.

     A LEERING HOMELESS GUY with a greasy rag and greasier
     cleaning solution approaches the windshield.

                          ARMENIAN
                No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!

     The Homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield
     with his dirty rag. The driver sends him away.

     The light turns green.  The Driver accelerates, turning
     on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by
     the guy.

     Susan sees something.

                          SUSAN
                Pull over!

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                What...?

     Susan motions excitedly.  The Driver pulls over. Susan
     gets out.

     EXT. OUTSIDE CAR

     Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield
     wiper.

     A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.
     She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani.

                          PETER
                So?

     Susan looks around.  Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by
     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
     performance artists.

     An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.

     EXT. EMPTY LOT

     Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small
     urban wilderness.  Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them
     from the weeds.

                          RICKY (OS)
                If you want your money back, forget it!

     Peter and Susan look up.  The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE
     CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.

                          DAVIS (OS)
                We already spent it!

     Susan walks forward.

                          SUSAN
                We're here to deal.

     Long beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

     A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND.

     At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the
     busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously
     nearby.

                          PETER
                Here, let me...

     He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a
     PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-
     brown colored EGGCASE.

                          SUSAN
                You sure you didn't see one of these?

                          RICKY
                Gross. What is it?

                          SUSAN
                An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had
                more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

                          RICKY
                     (shakes his head)
                No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

     Davis opens the door with a CLICK.

     INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

     A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers.

     Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-
     limits area.

                          DAVIS
                It was in that corner over there.

     Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS.

                          RICKY
                Sucker was fast, man.
                     (Picks up a pipe.)
                Had to take it out with one a these.

                          PETER
                Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.

     Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it
     slyly.

                          RICKY
                Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops
                you're here.

     Peter regards the little scam artist dryly.

                          PETER
                Let's keep it at five and I won't
                condemn your clubhouse.

     Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys
     take off.

     Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket.

     Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES
     where the sinks used to be.

     PETER

     inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects:
     chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared
     heroin syringes.

     Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up.

                          PETER
                     (quietly)
                Look, a broken tooth...

     Something rustles nearby.

     He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It
     seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it.

     SUSAN

     kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there
     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off
     the tile walls.

     Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening.

     Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.
     She starts pulling something out.

     PETER

     at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it...

     ...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly
     camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.

     Peter recoils.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                You okay?

     He nods.

     SUSAN

     turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC
     NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of
     beads fall away...

     ...rolls under the locker...

     ...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going
     deeper till they comes to a stop.

     Susan peers where the beads fell.

                          SUSAN
                There's something under here.

     Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of
     beads and throws them at the base of the locker.

     CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way
     under.

     A moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it
     BOUNCING on cement. He shines his light inside.

     INT. HOLE - PETER'S HAND

     Very dark. A highlight glints off a shell-like surface.

     The light barely touches it.

     THE WHOLE SURFACE BACKS AWAY.

     Peter drops the penlight.  It gets stuck in a jutting piece
     of concrete.

     PETER

                          PETER
                Shit.

     Peter tries to get his hand in

     DEEPER

     But he cannot reach the light. It is literally inches from
     his fingers...

     SUSAN

                          SUSAN
                Let me try.  My hands are smaller.

     She kneels and goes for it.

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     Her hand reaches for the penlight.

     She barely touches it.  The penlight spins around.  Its light
     now illuminates...

     THE FACE OF A MAN.  Unseen by Susan.  Terrifying in its doll-
     like simplicity.  In the darkness, its features seem
     indiscernable, inert, almost frozen in a perfectly
     symmetrical pattern.

     It regards the spiderlike movement of Susan's fingers.

     SUSAN'S

     face squinches with the effort.

                          PETER
                Honey, just leave it.

                          SUSAN
                No, there's...

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     As Susan's hand moves closer, the strange Face begins to
     TREMBLE.

     A CLICKING SOUND.

     Susan's hand is almost there.

     SUSAN

     reaches further.

     And suddenly A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness.

     Their vision resolves. The figures of two MTA COPS stand
     before them:  ERNEST, 50, burly and bull-necked; and LEONARD
     -- African American, 45, more formidable than fat.

                          LEONARD
                     (Wearily)
                Now don't tell me.

     INT. HOLE

     Susan's hand withdraws.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                You lost a token, right?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATER

     SHH-SHH-SHH.  A felt rag is expertly being pulled across a
     set of pristine black shoes.

     REVEAL Leonard sitting like a king in a chair, getting his
     shoes shined by Manny.  He leans back laconically while
     arguing with Peter. Ernest examines the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                Look, I showed you my badge...

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot
                bigger one you wanna go down there.
                That's the old maintenance grid, Doc.
                Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...

                          PETER
                The Department of Public Health...

                          LEONARD
                ...should know better'n to go sneakin'
                around my turf...

                          PETER
                Fine.  You want me to call your
                supervisor?

                          LEONARD
                Please do.  He's a lonely guy.

     Uninterested, Leonard looks over to Susan and Chuy.

     ANGLE ON SUSAN

     She leans against the wall, inspects her dirty hand. Ernest
     gives her his handkerchief.

                          CHUY (OS)
                Gucci.  Flat pump.

     She looks down at Chuy, who sits nearby, holding a PAIR OF
     SPOONS.

                          ERNEST
                Your shoes.

     She stares down at her shoes.  Gucci flat pumps, all right.
     Susan smiles.

     Just then, a SUBWAY TRAIN pulls up.  The doors open,
     disgorging passengers. Chuy flips into action.  He starts
     playing his spoons, CLICKING them together, slapping them
     against his knee.

     Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons
     to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the
     VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN,
     the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY.

                          SUSAN
                     (Laughs.  To Chuy.)
                That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?

     Chuy doesn't answer.

                          ERNEST
                No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.

     Ernest discreetly points to his forehead.

                          MANNY
                     (immediately)
                He's special.

                          LEONARD
                He can imitate anything, you just watch
                him.

                          PETER
                     (Irritably, to Leonard)
                Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

                          LEONARD
                No, you talkin' at me.

     Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and
     walks past Peter as if he were invisible.

                          ERNEST
                     (discreetly, to Susan)
                Is there some reward for this?

                          SUSAN
                I guess that could be arranged.

     Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two-
                bit bureaucratic, territorial number
                on me?

                          LEONARD
                You wanna keep up the conversation, you
                best come back with the proper permits
                and the right attitude.

     Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow.

     Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm,
     heads off in another direction.

     Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of
     their steps.

     INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY

     Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes.

                          PETER
                You give someone a fucking uniform
                and... Did you hear how he talked to us?

                          SUSAN
                I heard how you talked to him.

                          PETER
                Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?

     Susan spares him an ironic look.

                          SUSAN
                He was just doing his job.

                          PETER
                Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!

     At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by
     sunlight.

                          PETER
                He wants a permit, I'll get him a
                permit.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK

     A train blurs by.

     A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to
     see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking
     out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light
     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.

     A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING.

     He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.

     A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage.

     He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly.

     He touches it again...

     ...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him
     reflexively.

     Ernest jumps back.

     Another SET OF LEGS emerges...

     Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes.

                          ERNEST
                Chrissakes...

     He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that
     it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP.

     Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated,
     toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim
     light, they almost seem like a single organism.

                          ERNEST
                Guys, c'mon.

     The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts
     getting annoyed.

                          ERNEST
                I told you to stick by the maintenance
                area.

                          BAG LADY
                Nah... It's private property now.

     Ernest looks at her, confused.

                          SKELETAL BUM
                He eats down there.

                          ERNEST
                Who?

                          HOMELESS MAN
                The Stickman.

                          BAG LADY
                Long John.

     The homeless man points.  Ernest turns his light.

     Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An
     arrow below it points east.

                          ERNEST
                Graffiti artist, uh?
                     (To Homeless People)
                Look guys, just get off my beat, you
                hear?  Get moving.

     Ernest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him,
     pick up their things and head into the gloom.

     Ernest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti
     painting of The Stickman.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER

     Ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in
     weakly from grates above.

     He stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a
     recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its
     HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal...

     A FIGURE crouched over something.

     We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds.

     CU ERNEST

     Squinting to see over his flashlight beam.

                          ERNEST
                Hey, buddy!

     No answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and
     ingested.  Ernest is revolted.

                          ERNEST
                Get off my track...

     The crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a
     unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN.

     Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff
     of hot wind that signals an approaching train.

     Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance.

     The Overcoat Man stands up.

     Ernest stops in his tracks.

     For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT
     in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood.

     A dead dog.

     The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his
     chest...

     ...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING
     FROM HIS TORSO.

                          ERNEST
                Sweet Jesus...

     The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He
     begins walking toward Ernest.

     Ernest backs away.

     The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS
     PAST!

     CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful
     arms.

     Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the
     dark figure, then raised above, taken away.

     TRACK

     The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS.

     The track is empty again.

     INT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER

     We PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'.

     INT. EXHIBITION FLOOR

     EXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect
     chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc.

     An opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All
     tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the
     displays; most just camp out at the buffet table.

     Peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the
     room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet
     table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her.

                          PETER
                Heya.
                     (Kisses her on the cheek.)
                Where's the boss?

     Siri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands
     alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit.

                          SIRI
                Ant mound.

     Peter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one
     of her eyes.

                          PETER
                You okay?

                          SIRI
                It's just a headache.  We were
                sandblasting Trump Tower here since
                four this morning.

                          PETER
                Maybe you should sit...

                          SIRI
                I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could
                use a good word right now.

     She nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves.

     Siri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the
     insect bite on her hand.

     PETER

     approaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes
     of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the
     refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem
     to blend into one another.

                          PETER
                Great crowd.

                          SUSAN
                No such thing, baby.

     She looks over at the crowd congregated around the
     buffet table.

                          SUSAN
                I get the feeling they came more for
                the potroast than the apterids.

                          PETER
                Fuck 'em.  They don't know what
                they're missing.

                          SUSAN
                     (Distantly)
                Right.

     Peter looks at her.

                          PETER
                What's wrong?

     Susan sighs.

                          SUSAN
                Oh...nothing that a little
                menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't
                cure. Least that's what I thought.

     Peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on
     her stomach.

                          PETER
                     (genuinely moved)
                Oh, no, you were-

                          SUSAN
                I was just late.

     Susan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant
     mound.

                          SUSAN
                Ironic, don't you think?  These guys
                can hatch hundreds of offspring in a
                single clutch of eggs, right? And
                here we are...

                          PETER
                Susan, we're not b-

                          SIRI (OS)
                Susan?

     Susan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of
     the glass case.

                          SIRI
                     (Weakly.)
                I'm sorry.  I think...I need...

     One of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is
     bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady
     herself.

     Her fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass.

                          SUSAN
                Siri...

     Siri collapses.  The exhibit tips over.

     Peter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit
     FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND!

                          SUSAN
                Siri!

     The room erupts into COMMOTION.

     Susan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the
     floor.

     Peter gently turns her over.

     Siri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like
     the Chinese workers in the sweatshop.

     Tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

     An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant
     hospital.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     Siri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room.

     Peter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS
     RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician.

                          PETER
                ...I think it's some kind of systemic
                infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases
                like it yesterday. A sweatshop in
                Canal.

                          RAYMOND
                     (to Peter.)
                Okay, look.  You better come in with
                me.  Help me through.

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM

     Raymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri,
     now lying on an operating table.

                          RAYMOND
                     (To Peter)
                All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the
                dril?

                          PETER
                It'll come back to me.

     RAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has
     been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and
     suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it.

                          PETER
                Looks like a Lyme disease rash.

                          RAYMOND
                It's not consistent with the internal
                bleeding. Any idea what bit her?

     Peter shakes his head.

                          RAYMOND
                I think we're gonna need to have that
                specimen here.

     An ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her
     throat.

     Blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube.

     ABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER.

     Staring down through the circular glass deck, Susan
     silently observes the procedures.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Salmon-colored LIGHT slants in from sodium vapor streetlight.
     PAN through the shadowy room, past Manny's sleeping form to
     Chuy, asleep under a tent made of an old Star Wars blanket.

     A RHYTHMICAL CLICKING SOUND is heard from outside.

     Chuy pops his head out from under the blanket, listening.

     EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Wearing only his pajama bottoms, Chuy steps out on the fire
     escape with his spoons in hand.

     The CLICKING RESUMES from the building across the street.

     OVERHEAD VIEW

     The barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the
     center of the huge PAINT STAIN on the sidewalk.

     The CLICKING sound comes again.

     STREET LEVEL

     The CLICKING comes again from inside the flophouse.  It
     continues a little bit, then stops.

     Chuy CLICKS his spoons together, mimicking the sound.

     Beat.  A CLICKING from within again; almost an answer.

     Chuy ducks under the yellow DOH tape, walks toward the front
     of the building.

     He comes to the boarded entrance.  There is a hole, narrow,
     and low in the doorway.

     Chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.

     INT. FLOPHOUSE - LOBBY

     Chuy steps into the lobby.

     The CLICKING comes again, from further inside.

     Chuy moves to find it.

     CHAPEL

     Bits of STREETLIGHT slant in.  Chuy walks slowly, listening.

     He steps into the SHADOW of a LOOMING FIGURE.  He turns...

     CHUY'S POV - CRUCIFIX

     We start on bleeding, nail-pierced feet, then TILT up the
     twisted body to the face of Jesus, looking down.

     CHUY

     stares without emotion at the plaster figure.

     MOVEMENT to his side.  He turns again.

     A dimly-lit FIGURE stands before him.

     Shapes fold and regroup in the darkness, resolving into the
     tall figure of the OVERCOAT MAN.

     The Man begins to emit the CLICKING NOISE from under his
     chin, his whole head VIBRATING.

     Chuy smiles.  He has a beautiful smile.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     He plays his spoons, imitating the sound the figure made.

     He is answered...but this time, it's from the other side of
     the room. We PAN as he turns.

     ANOTHER OVERCOAT MAN appears in the shadows.

     Chuy GIGGLES, delighted.

                looking for.

                          PETER
                You said that thing was big as your
                hand.  I don't think I'm going to

                Why take the chance?  Just let me go

                          PETER
                No.

     Susan glares at him.  Peter sits down by her.

                          PETER
                Susan, listen to me:  you handled
                that insect almost as much as Siri...

                          SUSAN
                It didn't bite me.

                          PETER
                I know.  But if it was carrying
                something...there's a chance you
                could have been exposed.

     Susan is silent.

                          PETER
                Chris is going to run some blood
                tests on you.  I want you to stay here
                till he's absolutely sure you're
                clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me...
                You'll catch up with us...

     Susan looks up at him. Finally, she nods.

                          PETER
                We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.

     He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems
     hardly reassured.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New
     York dragging itself out of bed.

     We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot
     plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him.

                          MANNY
                My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get
                a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you
                that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!

     Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them
     in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind.

                          MANNY
                Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em,
                Chu-chu...
                     (He pours a glass of milk.)
                We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to
                pick some up tonight, okay?

     He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside.

     His grandson is gone.

     EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN

     Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks.

     A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the
     larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling
     hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags...

     A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a
     CONTROL BOOTH above.

                          WORKMAN
                Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.

     SOUND of the pump coming to a halt.

     The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling
     hook into the polluted waters.

     UNDERWATER SHOT

     Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the
     filter...

     ...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE...

     ...and connects with a LARGER FORM.

     ABOVE WATER

     The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a
     YANK, hooking whatever it is.

     He begins pulling it up.

     A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface.

     The Workman's face goes pale.

                          WORKMAN
                Oh, God...

     A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A.

                          WORKMAN
                I think it's a baby!

     The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)
     toward the edge of the tank.

     He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.

     The Workman SCREAMS.

     His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

     hands.

                How you feeling?

                          SUSAN
                You tell me.

     He smiles, gives her one of the cups.

                          RAYMOND
                Your blood tests were all negative.
                You checked out.

     Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward.

                          SUSAN
                What about Siri?

                          RAYMOND
                She's stable.  I don't think there's
                any immediate danger, but we'll have
                to keep her under observation...

                You think it's some form of

     Beat.  Raymond shrugs.

                Pathology's still working on the

     INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM

     At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face,
     trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror.
     We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained.

     She walks out of the ladies room, drying her face with a

     SOUNDS of a nearby argument catch her attention.

                Well, what the hell else am I suppose
                to do with it?

     Susan heads in the direction of the voices.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY NEAR MORGUE

     An ORDERLY (JEREMY) argues with an EMT.  Their point of
     contention:  a small FORM lying on a stretcher.

                Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris
                Raymond, will you?

                          JEREMY
                Lady...

                          SUSAN
                Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond!
                NOW!!

     Jeremy hesitates.  But if her tone wasn't enough, the
     stare she gives him certainly is.

                          JEREMY
                Okay.

     Jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall.

     Susan approaches the stretcher.

                          SUSAN
                     (To EMT)
                Where'd you find it?

                          EMT
                Washed up at the filtration plant on
                Bank street. Some asshole there
                thought it was a baby. They called
                us.

     Susan bends over it.  She covers her mouth and nose at
     the stench.

                          EMT
                It's a lobster, right?

     But it's not.  What lies on the stretcher before them
     looks more like a demon from a Brueghel painting.

     A THREE FOOT INSECT.  It's mephitic, pink-white body is
     rotten, falling apart.  The head's intact, with strange,
     large jaws thrown wide open. The chitin on one is half
     gone.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

     Josh deposits a backpack full of equipment on the floor,
     along with a small acrylic cage. Peter trains his FLASHLIGHT
     into the bank of lockers.

     Leonard, weary and pissed, looks at his watch.

                          LEONARD
                Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's
                almost over.

     Josh hands him a piece of paper.

                          PETER
                Guess someone requested you for
                overtime...buddy.

     Peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of
     lockers clear--the locker section tips and falls with an
     ENORMOUS BANG, which echoes loudly off the tile walls. Dust
     flies everywhere.

     When the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the
     area of the wall where the lockers stood, we see a LARGE
     HOLE.

     Using a steel probe, Susan examines the dead insect.

                Posterior sternites are gone...half the
                protonum rotted off.

     Raymond lifts one of the wings.  A CLUMP OF WHITE LARVAE
     feasts on the flesh underneath.

                          RAYMOND
                Maggots...

                Near hatching.  Thing must've died about
                three weeks ago.

     Susan closes the mandibles and examines them.

                          SUSAN
                Do you have a polaroid?

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

     Water DRIPPING from overhead, ECHOING footsteps- very
     spooky.  Leonard leads Peter and Josh down the tunnel-

                          LEONARD
                You all watch your step.  We got some
                burrows goin' down seven stories
                here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to
                come pick you up.

                     (Whisper to Peter)
                New York's finest.

     Monumental archways give way to naves as big as Notre Dame.

     Josh flashes the ultra-violet light over an abandoned
     underground encampment, made of cardboard walls, electrical
     wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. The walls are completely
     taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and
     messages. Everything from "Kilroy was here" to
     elaborate quotations from the bible.

                          JOSH
                There's really people living down here?

                          LEONARD
                Mole people. This section was pretty
                popular, all the way to Fulton Street...

     Their flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust. The air is
     heavy.

                          LEONARD
                Substance abusers, mental cases... Then
                about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors
                got started... Someone found a couple of
                stiffs...

     They work their way down a steep incline. They're covered in
     sweat.

                          LEONARD
                Down here's the land of talk, see? So the
                wildest version goes the farthest. They
                mark that area with a sign or a drawing,
                and its as good as closed.
                     (chuckles)
                We had one fella... for years said he was
                Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo.

     Peter's cellular rings. He picks up -big static-

     INTERCUT WITH:

     MORGUE

     Susan's got the phone up on her shoulder, clamped against her
     ear. Raymond's cranking out a bunch of Polaroids. Color shots
     of the insect, from every angle.

                          SUSAN
                It's me. Can you hear me?

                          PETER
                     (phone, barely audible)
                Yeah, barely. We haven't found
                anything down here. Nothing...

     Jeremy goes to the fridge for a beer.

                          SUSAN
                I have.

     The fridge light plays over the large insects jaws. It makes
     out a few new ridges and valleys. Raymond snaps a couple of
     Polaroids.

                          SUSAN
                I'm on my way. I've got something for you
                to look at...

     Susan notices something weird and undefinable about the
     contours of the claws... But she can't put her finger on
     it.

     BACK AT THE TUNNEL

                          PETER
                We'll be back at the platform in...

                          LEONARD
                20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing
                anymore.

                     (To phone.)
                20 minutes.
                     (Beat.)
                Susan?

     The call is lost. Peter tries to change frequencies, but it's
     useless.

     Peter replaces the phone in his pocket.  He walks off.

                          LEONARD
                Funny.  Shoulda seen some track
                bunnies by now.

                          JOSH
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're
                usually around.

     No one notices the OVERCOAT MAN carving on the wall.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     On Manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has
     accumulated. The radio is playing a sad, elegiac Tango.

                          MANNY
                No, no, please understand... I can't
                wait that long.

     Looking disheveled and tired, Manny clutches the phone,
     listening intently.

                          MANNY
                Please. I write it down.
                     (he writes)
                2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean
                "case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When
                can you...?

     He holds a color snapshot of Chuy sitting on a mailbox.

                          MANNY
                No, I can't wait...no, listen...

     Click. Manny slowly hangs up. He stares at his notepad, at
     the number 2873.

                          MANNY
                Hijos de puta.

     He crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window,
     picks up Chuy's last wire figure-

     FIGURE, CLOSER

     Another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with
     something slightly off about it.

     It has six limbs instead of four!

     MANNY

     frowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street.

                          MANNY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Distant thunder is heard.

     BATHROOM CABINET

     Manny takes a STRAIGHT RAZOR from the bathroom cabinet, opens
     the blade.

     EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

     Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway
     station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up.

     A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS
     AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi-
     deserted, a bit creepy.

     She takes a deep breath, descends.

     INT. SUBWAY - DAY

     Susan pushes through the turnstile, enters the long corridors
     of gleaming tile, a somewhat de-humanizing atmosphere,
     straight out of a George Tooker painting.

     Very creepy.  Susan's footsteps ECHO in the empty tunnel.
     She sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder- nobody is
     following her-

     PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY

     Susan observes the locker room door impatiently. A small crew
     of REPAIRMEN are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights.

     She sits and waits.

     INT. DEEP IN TUNNEL

     Peter, Josh and Leonard walk through a darker area. The
     floor beneath them suddenly changes, becomes tile.

                     (Sniffing)
                Smells like acid.

     Peter stops, looks around.

                          PETER
                Ammonia.

     Josh walks to the right, where the smell seems to emanate
     from.  At last they come to

     INT. VAULTED AREA - CONTINUOUS

     Josh LIGHTS a flare, sets it on the ground, walks ahead.  The
     ominous RUMBLE of a subway is heard in the distance.

     A cracked WATER MAIN above.  Water dribbles to the ground.

                          JOSH
                Peter...

                          PETER
                Yeah...?

                          JOSH
                There's some weird shit here.

                          PETER
                Weird shit...?

                          JOSH
                Take a look.

     Leonard shines his flashlight ahead.

     Revealed, quite literally, is a world of shit.

     LARGE FECES scattered everywhere:  on the floor, hanging
     sausage-like from the ceiling.  One can almost taste the
     stench of old ammonia.

     Peter puts on a rubber glove, inspects one of the fecal
     stalactites.

                          JOSH
                Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird
                shit.
                     (Beat)
                Whatever it is, it's not human.

     Josh breaks off a sample, drops it in a jar with a hard
     THUNK.  Leonard turns away in distaste.

                          LEONARD
                And it needs some metamucil.

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     It's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned
     flophouse.

     He peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there,
     on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger
     shoeprints...

     ...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     He kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too
     strong.

     ALLEY

     Manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for
     a way in.

     A DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns.

     Something moves in the shadows!  Something long and thin,
     haloed  by the rain.

     It moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting
     moment as it totters around to the rear of the building.
     It's The Overcoat Man!

     The man hurries past. Manny sprints after him.

     ALLEYS

     Manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates.

     There is the OVERCOAT MAN.

     CARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks,
     unloading produce.

     The OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head
     down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and
     hopping, he skitters into an alley.

     FOLLOWING

     Manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He
     pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue.
     Once it takes effect he moves on.

     The OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How??
     It's too high!!!

     The old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal
     fabric cuts his shirt.

     On the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except
     for...

     A SEWAGE GRATE

     Manny lifts it.

     SEWAGE PIPE

     Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He
     flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor.

     This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt.
     Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long-
     legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor.

     Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around
     his wrist and crosses himself with the razor...

     ...then begins to move down the pipe.

     Susan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar.

     The crew of repairmen are leaving.

                          REPAIRMAN
                Hey, Lady, all power will be down in
                five minutes, okay?

                          SUSAN
                Okay....

     She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught
     her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph.

     Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find
     something different in the lines.

     A train roars by.

     Then she notices it:

     THE POLAROID

     The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE.

     SUSAN

     Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room.

     A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and
     out.

     Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!!
     He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon
     lights.

     Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN

     carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers.

     She kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a
     noise.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her.

                          SUSAN
                Peter?

     OVERCOAT MAN

     The man's face TIPS BACK...

     ...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND
     ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS.

     Its multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN.

     Susan SCREAMS!

     The thing charges, its "coat" opening to reveal...SIX
     LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the
     whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly.

     Susan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known
     simply as "The Mimic" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST!

     She's dragged screaming into the hole.

     Their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs,
     wings and pipes.

     INT. VAULTED AREA

     Peter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack.

     Leonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some
     OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to

     THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION

     fifteen feet below.

                          LEONARD
                I've never been this deep. This area
                here is the Old Armory station. They
                built it in the 40's. Ran out of money
                half-way through...

     It's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic
     walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group
     of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel
     tracks.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.

     Everything is gray with dust.

                          PETER (O.S.)
                     (To Josh)
                I want a team in here by six tonight,
                hands and knees with toothpicks...

     Leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding.

     A NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile
     of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound.

     Keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends
     down, picks up a ROCK.

     PETER

     putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up
     and sees

     LEONARD

     step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the
     nymph.

                          PETER
                Don't!!

     SMASH! Leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it.

     Peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.

                          LEONARD
                Did you see the size of that thing?!

                          PETER
                Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-

     A CREAK from the scaffolding at their combined weight.

     Leonard grabs Peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding.

     CREEEEAAAAAK!

     THE ENTIRE SCAFFOLDING GIVES WAY!

     Buckling diagonally...

     ...taking Peter and Leonard with it...

     CRASH!  Both Peter and Leonard are thrown to the ground of
     the station below.  The scaffolding falls around them.

     JOSH

     rushes forward.

                          JOSH
                Peter!

     PETER AND LEONARD

     stir in the wreckage.  Peter rises shakily.  He puts his
     glasses on. One of the lenses is badly smashed.

                          PETER
                It's okay.  I'm all right.

     He tries to help Leonard up; Leonard knocks his hand away.

                          LEONARD
                Get the hell away from me!

     Peter looks up at Josh.

                          PETER
                     (Deadpan)
                He's all right, too.

     Leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie-talkie.
     It's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires.
     He curses under his breath.

     Peter checks the wall for a handhold.  But there's only
     smooth tile and dust.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, that's gonna work.

                          PETER
                You got a better way up?

     Leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to Josh.

                          LEONARD
                     (To Josh.)
                Show that to the station manager.  Tell
                him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt
                he don't have someone down here in ten.

                          JOSH
                H-how do I get...?

                          LEONARD
                Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to
                your right...

     Leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. Josh
     hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                Go left.  Go left again till you hit the
                fork... Then right again. You got that?

                          JOSH
                I think so. One right, two lefts...

                          LEONARD
                And a right.

                          JOSH
                Right.

                          PETER
                Go Josh. Now.

     Josh obeys.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. NICHE

     We hear a persistent BEEPING...

     A concrete ROOM filled with glimmering debris. Cans,
     eyeglasses, fake teeth, chrome, foil, glass shards, broken
     watches.

     Susan lies unconscious, half-sunk in a mulch of decomposing
     food, old newspapers, plastic garbage bags.  An inch of brown
     WATER burbles past her bloody head.

     SOMETHING jostles her, rocking her back and forth.

     Her eyelids slowly open.

     A HUGE MIMIC IS PERCHED ON HER BODY!

     Its WINGCASE is drooped around her like a shroud. The
     creature furiously tears at her jacket, trying to get at
     Susan's beeper.

     The beeper spills from her pocket along with several Pay Day
     bars.  The Mimic CRUSHES the machine instantly, then chomps
     up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles.

     Susan watches in terror as the creature steps away.

     A SOUND from an adjacent tunnel.  Susan looks...

     ...and sees ANOTHER MIMIC pulling the REMAINS OF A MAN into
     the darkness.

     Susan gropes around her in the soggy debris, looking for some
     weapon.

     SUSAN'S HAND

     Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE.

     Something dark drips on her hand.

     SUSAN

     looks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what
     is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the
     Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark.

     Susan GASPS.

     THE MIMIC

     hears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her.

     SUSAN

     jerks herself sideways...

     AND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK!

     Susan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back.

     The Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the
     wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself.

     Susan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing.

                                                            CUT TO:

     JOSH

     comes to a t-junction.  He checks his notepad for the
     appropriate direction.

     He turns, heads left.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. TUNNELS

     Susan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles
     into her grimy face.  She looks up.

     Rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can
     see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above.

                          SUSAN
                HELP!!!

     EXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT

     Life as usual on Delancey street.

     Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their
     umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front
     stores, boom boxes, car horns...

     They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice...

     SUSAN

     hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a
     metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

     SIDE TUNNEL

     CLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS
     the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.

     SUSAN

     looks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the
     floor, lifts it.

     A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness.

     The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder.

     Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the
     metal lid by handles on its underside.

     The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...

     Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid...

     WHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a
     second before the creature reaches it.

     The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.

     INT. HOLE

     The TICK-TICKING of the Mimic's antennae scanning the lid.

     Susan hangs from the handles on the lid, her arms trembling.

     Susan's strength gives out.  She lets go, falls.

     PIPE GALLERY

     Susan CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES.

     She MOANS in pain.

     CLOSER - SUSAN

     secures her position, looks down.  A seemingly bottomless pit
     below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS.

     The nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach.

     She is trapped.

     Then she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds
     her breath.

     A faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her.

                                                            CUT TO:

     WET SECTION

     Josh cautiously enters a vaulted area.  Old pipes have been
     ripped from the walls.  WATER gushes over the steel-plated
     walls.  He looks around- this doesn't seem familiar.

     Josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal PLATE
     on the wall.

     He yanks at the plate- it gives a little bit. He yanks
     harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging
     precariously from a loose bolt.

     It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.

     He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the
     tunnel behind him-

     JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL

     A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the
     floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.
     Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the
     water and the light of a flare.  It stops-

     JOSH

     Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his
     eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a
     narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT
     coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through
     the opening-

     MIMIC

     The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if
     mesmerized by its flow-

     PIT - JOSH

     With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.

     He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered
     around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the
     sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He
     looks up-

     Above him is a grate.  He's come to the SHOWER ROOM of the
     sweatshop!

     INT. SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a
     corner.  We TILT to see Josh moving the grate away.  He
     jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-

     HIS HANDS SLIDE!!

     PIT

     Josh puts the old sewing machine upright.

     OUTSIDE

     Suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the
     steel plate hits the ground: KLANGG!!

     THE MIMIC

     leaps into action!

     PIT - JOSH

     hears the CLICKING, fairly close.  He shines his light back
     down the hole he entered through-

     JOSH'S POV - THE MIMIC

     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.

     JOSH

                          JOSH
                Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

     He stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for
     the floor above-

     SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  His
     arms tremble. He makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab
     the POWER CORD of one of the abandoned sewing machines.

     THE MIMIC

     rushes through the opening without even slowing down.

     JOSH

     pulls himself up, up-  WHAM!  The Mimic hits the lower part
     of his body, BLOOD spraying up through the hole.  He SCREAMS,
     grasps the cord with both hands!

     He is brutally YANKED down into the hole, the sewing machine
     tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges
     violently in the hole!

     We track over to reveal, one of Chuy's perfectly
     executed WIRE SCULPTURES. Sitting atop another sewing
     machine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. REMAINS OF THE SUBWAY STATION

     A ring of FLARES burns in the darkness like an island.  Peter
     lights another one, revealing a space buried in layers of
     dust and time.

     Cracked MANNEQUIN FACES stares out from an unopened TAILOR
     SHOP.  A FLOWER PARLOR decorated with cobwebs.  A yellowed
     NEWSPAPER on the floor, its headlines reading:  GERMAN TROOPS
     DRIVEN BACK ACROSS RHINE.

     Peter looks up to see Leonard approaching from the track.

                          PETER
                Any luck?

                          LEONARD
                Well...there's an old service elevator
                half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna
                be much use, though.  Lines are dead.

     Peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which HUM
     ominously with electricity.

                          PETER
                You said those cables're still live.
                Can't we rewire...?

                          LEONARD
                Oh, man, there you go again.

                          PETER
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Those things bring juice to the new
                stations.  You just can't rewire that
                shit...

     Peter approaches him.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes, what's the problem?
                You need a memo every time you fart?

                          LEONARD
                All right, motherfucker, that's it.

     He pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet.
     Inches away from a fistfight.

                          PETER
                Shh! Shh!

     A SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the
     second.

     Where is it coming from?

     Peter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip,
     places his hand on his .22

     A SHADOW appears outside the archway.

     It steps onto the platform.

     Leonard frowns.

                          LEONARD
                     (tentative)
                Manny?!

     The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A
     rusted crowbar in his hand.

     Leonard walks over to him solicitously.

                          LEONARD
                My God, what the hell are you...?

                          MANNY
                Hurry, the woman needs help!

     A shadow crosses Peter's face.

                          PETER
                Woman?

     OUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness.

     REVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while
     Manny and Leonard grip his other.

     Susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing
     pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter.

     It's too far.

                          SUSAN
                     (A whisper)
                Don't.

                          PETER
                Listen to me:  we're getting you out.

     Leonard and Manny pull Peter back into

     INT. TUNNELS

     Peter undoes his belt.

                          PETER
                     (To Manny and Leonard)
                Give me your belts.

     They obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then
     loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.

                          LEONARD
                     (to Manny, as he ties them
                     together)
                What are you doing down here?

                          MANNY
                Chuy. He was taken. He's down here
                somewhere...
                     (to Peter)
                Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was
                after her.

                          PETER
                What's...?

                          MANNY
                Just hurry.

     Peter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower
     himself to the nearest pipe.

     Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.

     Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede
     into Hades.

     The lifeline tightens.

     Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his
     stomach and lets the belts down.

                          PETER
                I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.

     But then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

                          SUSAN
                No, Jesus, no.

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Toss the flare down!

                          LEONARD
                I only got...

                          PETER
                Just do it!

     Leonard lets the flare drop from his hand.

     It falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes,
     spinning down to the pitch-black below.

     And for a split second the flame illuminates...

     THE MIMIC

     pipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     PETER'S

     eyes grow huge.

                          PETER
                Oh, Jesus...

     LEONARD

     just plain loses it.

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is
                that?!

     SUSAN

     knows all too well what's coming for her.

                          SUSAN
                     (A desperate appeal)
                Peter...

     Throwing caution to the wind, Peter reaches the belt down.

                          PETER
                Wrap it around your hand!

     Susan at last gets a grip.  Peter pulls with both arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Getting closer.

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes,
     ascending foot by foot...

     Peter pulls her into his arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter bends down.

                          PETER
                Get on my shoulders!

     Susan steps onto his shoulders.  He pushes her up...

     And Leonard and Manny yank her out.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter scrambles up, SLAMS the lid back on the hole.

                          PETER
                Let's go!

     The four of them run.

     HOLD ON the lid.

     WHAM! It bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.

     INT. ABANDONED PLATFORM

     The four humans run down the empty platform.  Peter spares a
     look back.

                          PETER
                Oh, shit...

     Far down the tunnel,

     THE MIMIC HAS SPREAD ITS WINGS AND IS FLYING AFTER THEM!!

                          MANNY
                There!

     He points to the open DOOR of an ancient SUBWAY CAR.

     They sprint for the car, get to the door.  Manny, Peter,
     Leonard, then Susan...

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR

     ...tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty
     crates.

                          LEONARD
                Get the goddam door!

     Leonard and Peter both grab its handle, slide it shut...

     SPLACK!  The Mimic crashes into it!

     KLANGGG!  The door bulges out from the impact, almost
     tearing itself off the hinges.

     Susan jumps back.  Manny runs to cover her.

     The creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and
     forelegs waving wildly!

     The abdomen CRASHES through a pane of glass.

                          PETER
                Push it! Push it! Don't let up!

     Leonard and Peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.

     THE UPPER HALF OF THE MIMIC TEARS ITSELF LOOSE.

     WHITE BLOOD SPATTERS everywhere. The Mimic is NOW CUT IN
     HALF!

     The wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety
     window's outer panels.

     But the FRONT SECTION IS STILL ALIVE.  It scrabbles in,
     spraying white blood...

     ...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor
     and under a row of shelves in a half-circle around the car
     till it finally comes to a halt.

     Silence.  The only sound is a SKITTERING outside.

     Susan looks outside the window.

     The Mimic's REAR HALF IS STILL TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE
     DOOR, its feet blindly dragging along.

     LEONARD

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck was that?

     Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt.

                          LEONARD
                You better tell me what the hell's
                going on here!

                          MANNY
                Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!

                          PETER
                     (to Leonard)
                We don't know!! We don't know what it
                is!

     Leonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer
     to the still thing.

                          PETER
                Wait a minute-

                          LEONARD
                Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm
                going to-

     SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its
     front mandibles.

     A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the
     leg like a grinder-blender.

                          LEONARD
                GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!

     Peter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls
     and writhes on the floor.

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his
     guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS!

     But the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter
     tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good.

                          PETER
                Its muscles are locked.

                          LEONARD
                     (Hoarse)
                Oh, Jesus!!

                          MANNY
                Wait...

     Manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts
     smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get
                it off!!

     He lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the
     flammable stuff.

                          PETER
                     (Stopping him.)
                Hey hey hey...

                          MANNY
                Is how we make loose the ticks back home.

     Peter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish.

     WHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE
     LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP.

     Peter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT
     from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR - LATER

     We now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey
     Mantle above an empty worktable.

     Peter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably
     shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT
     on her forehead.

     Peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then
     tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.

                          PETER
                Just keep holding it.  Can you do that
                for me?
                     (No reponse.)
                Susan?

     Susan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress.

                          MANNY (OS)
                Doctor Tyler?

     He turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard.
     His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to
     stir.

     Peter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his,
     like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then
     slowly manages to release his hand.

     He walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of
     his foot.

                          PETER
                You feel anything?

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, I feel like ripping your
                fucking eyes out...

                          PETER
                Leonard, listen.  I need to see if
                there's any nerve damage before we
                carry you back.
                     (No response.)
                Look, I'm trying to help you here...

                          LEONARD
                Oh, you helped me here, all right, white
                boy.  You and your goddam memo. You
                needed to prove your point, uh?

                          PETER
                I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you
                bleed to death is the best apology.

     Peter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods.

     Manny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car.

                          MANNY
                Where the hell'd that thing come from?

     Peter looks at Susan.  She remains silent.

                          PETER
                     (Quietly)
                A mistake.

                          LEONARD
                "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

                          PETER
                It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.

                          LEONARD
                How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin'
                around with its buttside gone and a
                fucking pipe through its heart...

                          SUSAN
                     (Quietly)
                It doesn't have a heart.

     Peter looks up at her.

                          SUSAN
                Just inner chambers...

                          MANNY
                But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

                          SUSAN
                No...

     She gets up, finally moving.

                          SUSAN
                That's what it wanted you to see.

                                                            CUT TO:

     OUTSIDE CAR

     The subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly
     glowing in the dark. The door opens, and Manny and Peter
     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.

     INSIDE CAR - A LITTLE LATER

     The lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.
     Susan is reassembling it.

                          PETER
                So, you're saying this is like those bugs
                that -- that look like twigs or leaves
                or...

                          SUSAN
                     (shakes her head)
                That's camouflage...

     Susan displays the partly-charred head.

                          SUSAN
                This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic
                their predators. A butterfly can look
                like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar
                can copy a snake...

     Susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained
     bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.

                          SUSAN
                This has evolved to mimic the most
                dangerous predator it's ever had...

     She holds it in her hand, like Yorick's skull. The mimic's
     head obscenely mirrors her own. She inserts it into the
     shoulder cavity.

     She stands back.

                          SUSAN
                Us.

     CAMERA cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like
     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

                          SUSAN
                Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas
                that code...

                          MANNY
                     (quotes)
                "...and behold he will come that walks as
                a man, yet is not a man- ..."

                          SUSAN
                This, is our baby Peter. Yours and
                mine. Aren't you proud?

     OUTSIDE OF THE CAR - IN THE TUNNELS

     We see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and
     ceiling...

     ...heading towards the car...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     A SUBWAY MAP on the wall.  Red, blue, and orange lines
     branching through the boroughs like veins.

                          SUSAN
                All these...they're like tunnels of an
                insect colony. Once these things hit a
                certain population density, they'll have
                to move out, form new colonies.

     The realization hits the others.

                          SUSAN
                We have to get help down here.  Burn
                the tunnels before...

     She's interrupted by a CLICKING from the tunnel ahead.

     It's answered by CLICKING from the tunnel behind.

                          LEONARD
                Get the doors!

     A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS to
     close in time.

                          PETER
                Is there a switch?

                          LEONARD
                Third rail is dead.
                     (To Manny and Susan.)
                Get me up.  There must be a manual
                override in the booth.

     Manny and Susan help Leonard up.

                          SUSAN
                     (Whispering to Peter)
                The lights!

     Peter turns off the flashlights.

     Susan and Manny help Leonard to the car's CONTROL BOOTH.

     Peter looks

     OUTSIDE

     where the silhouette of a MIMIC moves to the rear of the car.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard opens a box on the side-wall marked MANUAL OVERRIDE.

     Inside, there is a large, HEXAGONAL SHAPED HOLE.

                          LEONARD
                     (Starts looking around)
                Where's the damn crank?!

     OUTSIDE

     The Mimic is only yards away.

     OTHER SHADOWS emerge from the distant dark.

     INSIDE

     Manny leaves Leonard and Susan to look for the lever crank.

     He runs to help Peter try and shut the doors manually.

     But it's useless.  Many of the doors won't budge.

                          PETER
                     (hissing a whisper)
                They're coming!

     OUTSIDE

     The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder...

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED
     ROD.  The lever crank.

                          SUSAN
                I got it!

     Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal
     shaped hole.  Perfect fit.

     Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and
     slow...

                          SUSAN
                Hurry! Please!

     THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR

     The doors begin to swing shut very slowly.

     OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV

     sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her
     hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as
     possible.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up
     the closing process.

     SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank
     one more time...

                          LEONARD
                Come on, you son-of-a...

     SUBWAY CAR

     A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON.

     Silence.

     All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the
     blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the

     WINDOWS

     caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the
     red flares.

     THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door.

     A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof.

     The car SHAKES.

     OUTSIDE

     The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.

     INSIDE

     SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a
     nail over a chalkboard.

     THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides...

     An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car.

     PETER

     A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face
     is reflected in a security window.

     CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection.

     ABOVE MANNY

     Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent.

     BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD

     Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in.

     Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of
     the clicking...

     ...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, God.
                     (Looks at Leonard.)
                The blood...

     KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them!

     Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as

     IN THE SUBWAY CAR

     KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling!

     SUSAN AND LEONARD

     emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's
     shoulder.

                          SUSAN
                His blood! It's driving them crazy! We
                have to mask the odor!

                          PETER
                How?!

     But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.

     Leonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around
     his wound to mask it. Manny helps.

     Peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken
     window as a barricade.

     Despite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the
     scent.

                          PETER
                It's no use! They know we're in here!

                          SUSAN
                They don't know anything Peter, they
                just sense. They're hardwired!

                          PETER
                Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's
                not like them!

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

                          SUSAN
                Exac...

     She looks over at the severed Mimic corpse nearby.  A
     realization...

                          SUSAN
                     (To Manny)
                Give me your razor.

     Manny looks at her blankly. Susan just takes the blade.

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

     She runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she
     hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice.

     She SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor...

                          PETER
                What are you doing?

     ...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...

     ...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of
     softballs.  She SLICES them open.

     Orange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering.

                          LEONARD
                     (covers his nose)
                Shit!

     Peter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Rub it on the windows!

                          PETER
                What-

                          SUSAN
                Just do it!!

     Holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the
     crap on the windows, the doorframe...

     MANNY

     looks to the roof, listening.

     And remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START
     SUBSIDING.

     Susan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on
     Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink.

                          LEONARD
                What are you putting that crap on me
                for?

                          SUSAN
                Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to
                identify themselves to each other.

     She smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds
     down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SUBWAY CAR - LATER

     Leaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak
     for every Mimic he sees.

     Peter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has
     created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris
     and the wall map.

                          LEONARD (O.S.)
                Okay. That's us.

     Manny's lighter represents the subway car.

                          LEONARD
                This track we're on? Goes down into
                the repair area.
                     (Makes an "X" further down)
                The elevator's over here. Leads up to
                the active tunnels.

     THUMP! An oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against
     the glass. Manny moves away.

                          PETER
                Can we get this car there?

                          LEONARD
                Someone'd have to go to the
                switchroom, pull the coupling lever,
                that'll send us left and to the
                elevator.

                          SUSAN
                But the power...

                          LEONARD
                Hell, I might be able to juice the whole
                area, if I can get to the power box. It's
                just a couple of cables...

                          MANNY
                Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard?
                Hop?

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Just talk me through it. I can go with
                Manny.

                          LEONARD
                It would take a minute or so.
                     (beat)
                You won't last that long out there.

                          SUSAN
                Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

     Tense silence. He points at the glands on the floor.

                          PETER
                We'll cover ourselves with this. They
                can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

                          SUSAN
                Peter-

                          PETER
                It worked before...

                          SUSAN
                     (an edge in her voice)
                The scent won't last...

                          PETER
                That's why we should do it now.

     Susan knows they have no other choice.

     LATER

     Susan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the
     thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center.

                          LEONARD
                It's just a regular old pump switch,
                okay? Right by the track signal
                board.

     Manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on
     himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them-

                          LEONARD
                The lights come up, you pull the
                switch.

                          MANNY
                I pull.

                          LEONARD
                You don't do that, we're on the wrong
                track.
                     (turns to Peter)
                You...

     The two men look into each other's eyes.

                          LEONARD
                You gonna finally get to fuck around
                with the wires.  Think you can
                handle it?

                          PETER
                Depends.  You got a memo?

     Leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost
     imperceptible smile.

     Using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back
     of Peter's hand.

                          LEONARD
                All right then.  You gonna find two
                wires.  One's green.  The other's
                blue...

     SUSAN

     approaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window.

                          MANNY
                He's out there. I heard him. How can
                he be? This things...

                          SUSAN
                Manny...

                          MANNY
                I didn't protect him, lady. He
                trusted me. And I didn't protect
                him... His father...I lost his father
                to the streets and now, Chuy...

                          SUSAN
                We'll find him. We'll be back and
                find him.

     Manny doesn't respond.

     READY TO GO

     Susan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the
     scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she
     speaks.

                          SUSAN
                You're going to have to keep it
                really slow.  Their eyes react to
                sudden movements.

     Peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He
     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes,
                try not to sweat.  They can sense
                chemical changes...

                          PETER
                Try not to sweat?

     Leonard turns to Susan and Peter.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, people...

     Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                ...are we ready for this?

     Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep
     breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's
     an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.

                          LEONARD
                Whatever you do, don't step on the
                third rail coming back. Six hundred
                volts'll blow your leg right off.

     A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get.

     He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.

                          PETER
                I was just thinking how I could use a
                pair of pliers... and I remembered where
                they are...

                          SUSAN
                     (overlapping)
                That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.

     A sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face.

                          PETER
                In the tool box under the kitchen
                counter...

     Susan kisses him softly on the lips.

     Manny approaches.  Show time.

     Susan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control
     booth.

                          SUSAN
                Open it.

     LEONARD

     begins turning the lever crank slowly.

     SUBWAY DOORS

     gradually begin to open, and stop half way.

     The darkness outside is alive with CLICKING.

     PETER AND MANNY

     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their
     way to

     INT. PLATFORM

     They step onto the dusty concrete.  Come to a stop.

     SUSAN

     watches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics

     OUTSIDE

     LARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none
     of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other.

     Peter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's
     working.

     Peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER
     BOX.

     Manny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the
     platform to the SWITCH ROOM.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass,
     filled with the bloody bandages.

     PLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS

     Peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering
     to himself.

     He lowers himself slowly to the track.

     PLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM

     Manny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS
     reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter gets to the track.  He turns

     And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!

     Its antennae move toward his head, curious.

     Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.

     Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...

     SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard has now fully opened the doors.

     SUSAN

     pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's
     midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive.

     The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics
     outside.

     Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of
     the car...

     ...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.

     OUTSIDE

     The other Mimics take instant notice.

     BY PETER

     The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,
     it's gone, heading toward

     THE DEAD MIMIC

     stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow
     into a feeding frenzy.

     The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother
     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches in disgust.

                          SUSAN
                Choke on it, motherfuckers.

     Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to
     shut.

     PETER

     breathes a sigh of relief.

     He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.

     He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.
     The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO
     THE GREEN WIRES.

                          PETER
                     (to himself)
                Green...Blue...

     He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.

     All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic
     casings having long ago faded into goo.

     INT. SWITCHROOM

     Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of
     the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White
     Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s
     style LAMPS are built into their side.

     Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the
     rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.

     Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he
     waves back to LEONARD.

     He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands
     are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills
     scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans
     against the wall.

     A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the
     entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.

     It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.

     Spoons.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...?

     Manny follows the sound.

     BY THE TRACK

     Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.
     He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance
     of color.

     He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.
     Breathes...

     INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

     The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and
     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.

     Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.

     Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet
     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.

     A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around.

                          MANNY
                     (Whispering)
                Nino...

     He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before
     the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless
     smile on his pale face.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     BY THE POWERBOX

     Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now
     to the fuse-section.

     A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.

     One is still occupied.

     The other one empty.

                          PETER
                Dammit!

     CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD

     BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches the Mimics at their feast.

     All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.

                          SUSAN
                     (horrified)
                The scent's fading...

     Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.

                          LEONARD
                     (tense as hell)
                What's Manny doing? I can't see him
                anymore.

     ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

                          MANNY
                Nino, please...

     Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture
     of "come to me".

     In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND
     floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw
     gestures as it falls through the air.

     Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm
     frond.

     It's a wing.

     Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.

     The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of
     a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the
     females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic
     clusterfuck.

     Manny is sickened.

     CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face
     falls.

                          MANNY
                Dios mio...

     The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING...

     ...unfolding...

     ...at last revealing...

     AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution...

     Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more
     supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still
     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to
     them that at the very least entrance us.

     The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny
     boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.

     Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.

     The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as
     if trying to communicate with the boy.

     Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a
     perfect imitation of the sound.

     Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with
     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-

                          MANNY
                     (barely audible)
                Chuy...

                          CHUY
                     (whispers)
                Friends.

                          MANNY
                NO, NO, CHUY, NO...

                          CHUY
                Friends.

     The Albino CLICKS his jaws, moving in toward Manny.

     CHUY

     plays his SPOONS in perfect imitation.

     MANNY

     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. He raises his
     arms, like a prophet. He lets go of hsi razor and kneels.

                          MANNY
                God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot
                see...

     His vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange
     serenity invades him.

     The Albino's jaws open and charge.

     PLATFORM

     Some Mimics advance toward Peter's direction.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,
     trying to attract their attention.

                          SUSAN
                Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter BREAKS the arm off one of his glasses.  He jams it at
     the empty fuse.  It SPARKS.

     PLATFORM

     THUMP!  The electricity COMES ON...

     The lamps on the columns BURST INTO FLAMES from the power
     surge.  Fire illuminates the station like a Greek temple.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter climbs up onto the tracks...

     ...sweat staining his forehead...

     Peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.

     THE MIMICS

     clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees
     reacting to honey.

     SUBWAY CAR

                          SUSAN
                     (to Leonard)
                THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

     LEONARD

     looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which
     button to press. He begins to press each one in turn.

     PETER

     hears the sound of spoons playing.

     He turns to see Chuy, standing by the outside of the switch
     room.  The boy smiles. A flashlight shines behind him.

                          PETER
                Manny...

     But the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:
     The ALBINO steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung
     puppet. His claws and jaws are coated in blood. Chuy joyfully
     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.

     THE MIMICS

     climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-

     SUBWAY CAR - CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan runs in.  SLAMS her hand down on a button.

     FSST!

     THE SUBWAY CAR

     The doors open.

                          SUSAN
                Peter!!

     Peter hesitates, takes a step toward Chuy.

                          PETER
                Come on, kid...

     Chuy seeks shelter behind the Albino's legs.

                          PETER
                     (horrified)
                Jesus!

     The albino charges toward him.

                          SUSAN
                Run!! Peter!!

     Peter bolts for the car.

     THE MIMICS

     jump and land

     SUBWAY CAR

     just as Peter squeezes through one of the doors.

     BAM! THUD! The doors dent. Glass cracks.

                          SUSAN
                     (Yelling to Leonard)
                GO!!

     Susan presses the button. The doors close again.

                          LEONARD
                The kid...

                          PETER
                The kid's with them!!

                          LEONARD
                What do you-?

                          PETER
                Go!! Just go!!

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board.

     SUBWAY CAR

     JOLTS into action.

     OUTSIDE

     The train LURCHES forward.

     Wheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re-
     assemble quickly, ready to attack.

     THE ALBINO

     changes position and charges towards the car.

     THE MOVING CAR

     reaches a "Y" section.  The car moves to the track to the
     right.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard's eyes go wide as he sees

                          LEONARD
                He didn't do it!

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Manny never threw the coupling switch!!
                We're goin' the wrong way!!!

     OUTSIDE CAR

     It keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination.

     ...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and
     repair equipment on the tracks.

     A crash seems inevitable.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Leonard pulls

     THE BRAKES

     but they don't work at all.

     From below the car we see the wheels spinning freely,
     heading for collision.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Susan grabs Leonard from the control booth. To Peter

                          SUSAN
                MOVE BACK!!!

     They rush back against the opposite door.

     STORAGE YARD - SUBWAY CAR

     CRAAASHH!!  The car BASHES into a parked section of train in
     a GRIN of tearing metal...

     ...flips off the track...

     ...and onto its side...

     The car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     All three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter
     has badly damaged his right arm.

                          SUSAN
                You all right?

     Peter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard.

                          LEONARD
                     (Simply, re: his leg)
                Can't feel it.

     Peter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders.
     They raise him up.

     OUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     They move unsteadily outside.

                          SUSAN
                Which way?

                          LEONARD
                Across both tracks!!

                          PETER
                Shit.

     They head off over a concrete island in the direction of the
     correct track.

     FURTHER BACK

     The Mimics and the Albino moving closer.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     try to hurry, but it's no use given Leonard's condition.

                          LEONARD
                     (Quietly)
                Lemme go.

     Peter and Susan both disregard the order.

                          SUSAN
                We're no leaving you!

                          LEONARD
                No way we can outrun 'em together.
                Move it!

     Leonard suddenly grabs his POLICE BATON from his belt
     clip.  He pushes the two away.

                          LEONARD
                NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat!

     Leonard turns away from them.

     Peter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA
     officer is staying put.

                          LEONARD
                Come on.  Come to poppa.

     Reluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel.

     LEONARD

     takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FURTHER DOWN

     Peter and Susan run.

                          SUSAN
                There.

     An open CAGE ELEVATOR on a platform nearby.  A sign overhead:
     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

     They rush toward it.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - "Y" SECTION

     Leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth.

     SOUNDS of the Mimics approaching. He glances at the third
     rail beside him, then down the track.

                          LEONARD
                Come here, you mealy-mouthed...

     The sound gets louder.

                          LEONARD
                Multi-legged...

     Leonard raises his baton in top MTA form.

                          LEONARD
                Maggot-munchin' motherfu...

     THUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard!

     Leonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton.

     They begin to tear at his limbs.

     Leonard rolls...

     ...kicks his good leg out...

     ...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL.

     AN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming
     Leonard and the Mimics.

     INT. BY THE CAGE ELEVATOR

     The crackling sound echoes through to Peter and Susan.

     Susan hits the elevator button again.

                          SUSAN
                I can't tell if it's working!

     Peter has unbarred the gate.

     SUSAN

     looks up, into the shaft.

     THE ELEVATOR

     coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, come on, come on!

                          PETER
                Jump in.

     Peter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate
     behind them.

     INT. SHAFT

     A skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a
     handhold.

     Peter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.  She
     balances on the narrow ledge.

     Peter SLAMS the cage door shut, latching it.

                          PETER
                You go first. I'll be right below you.

                          SUSAN
                Your arm, you can't...

                          PETER
                I can.  We can do this...

     He shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

     The Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics.

     It stops.

     Turns toward the elevator.

     INT. SHAFT

     Susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by
     handhold. Peter is right below her.

     She can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously
     with the effort.

                          SUSAN
                We're gonna make it!

     Peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next
     handhold.

     WHAM!  Something hits the gate below them!

     INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE

     The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate.

     The Albino remains still, watching them work.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts
     catching in her throat with the effort.

                          PETER
                Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going,
                even flow!

     Susan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the
     next level.

                          PETER
                C'mon...

                          SUSAN
                Ah...

                          PETER
                Talk to me.

                          SUSAN
                Peter...

     Susan pulls herself up.

                          SUSUAN
                I'm really glad I'm not pregnant.

     REVERSE

     We look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and
     the Albino have gotten into the shaft!

     The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against
     opposite walls.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     Susan is crying, barely any strength left.

     Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is
     barely hanging on himself.

     LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE
     TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down.

     MIMICS

     rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Peter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next
     floor.

     KCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up.

     Now the elevator is coming down.

                          PETER
                Hang onto me.

     Peter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them
     able to get a foothold on the ledge-

                          PETER
                Hang on tight!

     He begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan
     looks back down.

     SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT

     The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its
     mandibles.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through
     to the

     INT. SUBWAY TRACK

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Peter and Susan stumble away.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above.

     It gives a few CLICKS to its minions.

     The two other Mimics race up the shaft...

     ...toward the elevator...

     ...and WEDGE THEMSELVES IN ON EITHER SIDE!

     They are CRUSHED instantly.  But the elevator is stopped just
     above the open gate.

     With just enough room for the Albino to get through to

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

     Susan and Peter run.  There is LIGHT just up the tunnel.  We
     hear VOICES.

                          SUSAN
                Don't look back!

     They go for it.  At last, they make it to

     INT. A PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter stumble forward.  Light streams down from
     overheads. Susan turns.

     SUSAN'S POV

     The Albino spills out onto the track behind them.

     Sleek, streamlined, light glancing beautifully off it.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     turn back...

     HEADLIGHTS hit them as we hear the ROAR of a SUBWAY TRAIN
     heading at them from the other side of the platform!

                          SUSAN
                No...

                          PETER
                We can do it!

     They run.

     ALBINO

     runs, faster than any other Mimic.

     TRAIN

     The express train BLOWS its HORN, RUSHING FORWARD.

     PLATFORM - COMMUTERS

     Weary late-night COMMUTERS stand half-asleep on the tracks.
     A sleepy-eyed little girl points, tugging on her mother's
     hand.

                          LITTLE GIRL
                Mommy, there's people...

     PETER AND SUSAN

                          PETER
                     (Adrenaline pumping)
                We-can-do-this!!!

     MOTORMAN

     The driver sees the battered couple...

     He reaches for the brake...

     SUSAN AND PETER

     They reach the edge of the platform, the HORN deafening as
     the train speeds toward them.  Peter pushes Susan up, leaps-

     INT. TRAIN - CONDUCTOR

     We RUSH toward his horrified face.

     THE ALBINO

     directly ahead.

     The train, still flying, PLOWS INTO IT...

     ...flattening, grinding, pulverizing...

     ...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white
     blood.

     The motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in
     primal horror. The train SQUEALS to a stop...

     ON THE PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter collapse on the cement floor in each others
     arms.  Heaving and weeping.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

     COMMUTERS turn to stare as Peter and Susan move across
     the floor.  Both bruised and bloodied, leaning against
     each other, heading for the exit.

     Some DERELICTS observe them with curiosity.

     A trio of MTA cops start towards them.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... it... They're still
                down there. We'll seal the whole
                system, go in with whatever it
                takes...

     But Peter's voice evidences a lack of conviction now,
     he's trying to convince both Susan and himself of
     something he doesn't fully believe.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... We nailed them
                before, we'll do it again...

     He hurries to meet the MTA cops. Susan looks up.

     SUSAN'S POV

     Commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and
     out of the illuminated areas of the station.

     In the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face-  a MIMIC,
     hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment!

     We PAN 180 degrees to the other side of the platform-
     there, briefly glimpsed is ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.

     We TILT down to the throng below.

                          SUSAN
                     (barely audible)
                They've come up...

     The electrified VOICE of the train ANNOUNCER suddenly
     FADES UP, telling of departures and delays-

     We raise above Susan's head-

                          TRAIN ANNOUNCER
                The 11:16 local to Poughkeepsie,
                boarding now, Track 32- the 7:20
                Connecticut local, making
                connections to South Norwalk-

     DOWN ANGLE

     -culminating in an OVERHEAD VIEW of the main terminal.

     The movement continues. But from here, the people are
     dots, their importanec no greater than that of a colony
     of ants.

                                                          FADE OUT:

     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
     THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.




                                                           FADE IN:

     THE SCREEN

     Stygean darkness.

     Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
     them.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL

     INT. SEWER SYSTEM

     Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels.

     A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld
     UV lamps.

     The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,
     their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT
     VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-
     CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.

     The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.

     NIGHT-VISION POV

     Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some
     kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.

     THE TEAM OF FIGURES

     From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a
     flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.

     She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty
     small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach
     with a different BARCODE on their back.

     JUDAS ROACHES.

     She kneels and opens the

     CASE

     TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide
     through into the area.

     THE NEARBY ROACHES

     react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin
     to stream toward the Judases.

     Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.

     They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach
     the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them
     off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.

     LATER

     A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and
     attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.

     REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms
     of the roaches, now all DEAD.

     The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other
     disposal drums.

     At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:
     the bar-coded Judas Roaches.

     In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted
     by the chains through the manhole to

     EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY

     MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.

     Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink
     everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped
     dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send
     the cars on crosstown detours.

     Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
     dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked
     in a military phalanx.

     A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
     middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.

     Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches
     and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.

     The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is
     off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.

     An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.

                          PETER (OS)
                How we doing?

     She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A
     HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the
     DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's
     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.

                          SUSAN
                We'll see...

     He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,
     shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him.

     Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
     by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.

     THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.

     A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan
                like a thief in the night, claiming its
                first hundred victims before it was even
                classified.

     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT

     We FLOAT through a long hospital ward.

     Past ROWS of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in
     the dark like cocoons of light.

                          ANCHORMAN (VO)
                Most were children under ten.

     TRACK past tents.  BODIES OF SMALL CHILDREN inside, wrapped
     in white sheets, hooked up to IVs or breathing apparatus.
     Skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.

     BELLOWS of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.

     IMAGE RESOLVES TO A VIDEO ON A SCREEN.

     PULL BACK to reveal a number of SCREENS, each with a
     different set of images.  We are in a NEWS VAN.   A
     TECHNICIAN and DIRECTOR sit watching.

     The voice belongs to an ANCHORMAN who's now overimposed.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Only after the numbers had reached into
                the thousands were officials able to
                identify the carrier of the deadly
                infection...

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut to three.

     The Technician manipulates the controls.  On another screen
     we see them cut to STOCK NEWS FOOTAGE: regular cockroaches,
     crawling on garbage.

                          ANCHORMAN
                Blattida Germanica.  The common
                cockroach.

                          DIRECTOR
                     (To a RUNNER)
                Tell them we're ready for a live feed.

     EXT. OUTSIDE VAN - CITY HALL - DUSK

     The runner exits the News Van.  Other such vehicles parked
     nearby.  A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of
     PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.

     Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...

                          REPORTER 1
                ...an insect that has proven virtually
                immune to chemical control...

     REPORTER 3 is interviewing a Greenpeace PROTESTER who is
     holding up a photograph of Susan.

                          REPORTER 3
                ...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan
                Wyeth...

                          PROTESTER
                ...Susan has always been opposed to
                biological tampering. A real advocate
                for ecological causes, it's not...

     MOVE past them to further inside of the perimeter...

     INT. AUDITORIUM - CITY HALL

     A NEWS CONFERENCE in progress.  A packed house.  T.V.
     monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so. In the audience, the
     MAYOR OF NEW YORK and various CITY OFFICIALS, listening to

     Peter, speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of
     a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy.

     ON A TV MONITOR

     While Peter talks, a news title appears at the bottom of the
     screen: PETER TYLER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.

                          PETER
                     (wrapping up)
                ...in Nature, evolution is a long,
                leisurely conversation between an
                organism and its environment. We,
                however, did not have the luxury of
                time...

     Susan is waiting in the wings. She observes the audience.

     She notices that the entire front row is composed of CHILDREN
     who have survived Strickler's.  Leg and arm braces, facial
     scarring...

     He nods at Susan, who takes the podium, adjusting her jacket,
     slightly ill at ease in her business suit.  She clears her
     throat, speaks softly.

                          SUSAN
                With the aid of genetic labs throughout
                the country, we recombined cockroach DNA
                with genetic information from termites
                and mantids. We were able to create a
                biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if
                you will...

     She places a clear container on the podium for all to see.

                          SUSAN
                Blattida Traditor.

     CU CONTAINER

     One of the Judas roaches skitters about in the container.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                The "Judas Roach".

     Cameras FLASH.  MURMURS from the audience.

                          SUSAN
                The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers,
                with a short life-span and heightened
                pheromone emission.

     On the back row she can see some ecological hand-painted
     signs being raised in silent protest. She stumbles for a
     second, then resumes her speech.

                          SUSAN
                The female is basically a sexual magnet;
                common males travelled miles and fought
                for the right to mate with them.

     The audience is rapt.

                          SUSAN
                When they did, they took away something
                else we added -- a hormone, passed
                through sexual congress that causes their
                metabolism to go into overdrive.  No
                matter what their food intake, they
                starved to death in a matter of hours.

     Now Peter takes the mic.

                          PETER
                We've achieved almost total eradication
                of the roach population.  As of today,
                the disease has been officially
                contained.

     A STANDING OVATION starts and is carried on as we...

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SUSAN

     in a tub in a dark bathroom. Her business suit crumpled
     on the bathroom floor.  SOUND of a TV outside.

                          PETER (OS)
                Sus, come on.  You're missing it.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     Nothing grand.  Peter in his shorts at a TV with shitty
     reception.  He adjusts the disgruntled cable box.

     He is seen over the TV, giving his address.

                          PETER
                Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping
                this.
                     (Out.)
                Susan, come on.  It's really good this
                time. I got most of the lines out.
                     (No response.)
                Sus?

     Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and
     two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.

     INT. BATHROOM

                          PETER
                Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came
                and went and all we got was bad
                cable...

     Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.

                          PETER
                Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?

     He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it
     up, puts it up on the hanger.

                          PETER
                A shame.  You looked great tonight.

                          SUSAN
                Please.

                          PETER
                You did!

     He sits by the tub.

                          SUSAN
                Do you think we did the right thing?

                          PETER
                Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

                          SUSAN
                You know what I mean...

     Peter pours some champagne into the cups.

                          SUSAN
                We did no impact evaluation.  The
                consequences of...

                          PETER
                     (sighs)
                Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?

     We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV.

                          NEWSREADER (TV)
                ...a flawless strategy which has stopped
                a potential epidemic in its tracks...

                          PETER
                You hear that?  Flawless.

                          SUSAN
                We just don't know.

     He offers one cup to Susan.  She doesn't take it.

                          PETER
                We know we saved lives.

     He sits closer to her.

                          PETER
                There're gonna be a lot of kids running
                around next year because of you.

     Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her.

                          PETER
                Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple
                of 'em'll be ours.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiling now)
                We're down to a "couple" now, huh?

     She pats the water, beckoning.

                          PETER
                Oh, I don't know. People are beginning
                to talk about us...

     Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan
     shakes her head, laughs ruefully.

                          SUSAN
                Don't worry, I'll save your honor.
                Maybe I'll even marry you.

     She reaches over, kisses him.

                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                        FADE IN TO:

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT

     The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.

     ALPHABET CITY STREETS

     Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking
     on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy
     layer of rain.

     SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER

     A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made
     of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.

     CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.

     WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,
     thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild
     with terror.

     He looks back down the steps.

     Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex
     shadows on the wall.

     Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.

     The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.

     Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door
     shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...
     something inhuman, determined to break through.

     The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.

     On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to
     grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.

     He searches wildly for a possible escape.

     He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the
     sidewalk.

     Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the
     surrounding concrete.

     WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
     SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.

     The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the
     adjoining building...

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV

     Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
     suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a
     tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is
     being painted over.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.
     LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge
     gives.

     He CRIES OUT in terror.

     The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make
     it?

     He takes a few steps back, a few more...

     Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood
     and rain.

     THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.

     Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things
     onto the curtain of rain.

     Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself
     to the catwalk.

     It's too far.

     He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards
     loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He
     bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a
     loose board to save himself from falling.

     The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the
     edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.

     He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push
     with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.

     BELOW

     Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.

     CU HANDS

     The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.

     FEET

     The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to
     find a purchase on the wet brick wall-

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'
     model.  He looks up above him, sees something-

                          CHINESE PREACHER
                No.  Please, God, no!

     A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.
     Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely
     on one end.

     HANDS

     The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the
     wet wood.

     His hands paw the air.

     WIDER

     For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems
     suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.

     THE GROUND

     Impact. His body cracks the pavement.

     Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.

     We CRANE to reveal

     A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET

     CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the
     Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.

     He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.

     APARTMENT

     It's a small one-bedroom apartment.

     An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.
     MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,
     benign face.

     All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the
     table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.

     A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,
     standing by the window is

     CHUY

     HIS P.O.V.

     We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed
     figure in a swirl of color.

     Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.

     CHUY

                          CHUY
                     (a whisper)
                Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...

     He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
     wire into shape.

     THE PUDDLE OF PAINT

     around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,
     and across the neon sign...

     CHUY

     hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.

     His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
     change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
     his eyes.

     ACROSS THE ROOFTOP

     We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's
     attention.

     TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...

     The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins
     moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps
     forward and drops out of frame.

     CHUY

     His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
     arc.

     Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
     a better view.

     GROUND LEVEL

     The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the
     rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.

     CHUY

     We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other
     noise FADES AWAY.

     Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.

     He begins to click them together.

     Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER

     is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only
     problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
     this hole.

     CHUY

     watches, still clicking with his spoons.

     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY

     is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the
     thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
     against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.

     There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY
     VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body
     like a rag doll.

     CHUY

     His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear
     terrible cracking and scraping sounds.

     THE WINDOW

     The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the
     hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of
     the opening.

     CHUY

     watches, still fascinated.

                          CHUY
                     (very low)
                Funny, funny shoes...

     He starts a new wire sculpture.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN

     Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the
     Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the
     windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.

     Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his
     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his
     stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.

                          PETER
                Excuse me, ladies...

     Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past
     them.

     EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER

     Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a
     water fountain.

     As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the
     sidewalk.

     The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.

     Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points
     to a manhole cover set among the bushes.

     Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.

     Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.

     GRAFFITI

     A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged
     lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is
     little more than a malignant blotch.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY

     A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS --
     most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece
     representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a
     punkish young Indian research assistant.

     Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale
     clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the
     model's mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                ...no, guys, these have to fit
                perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let
                me tell you why. Insects have no
                hands. All they have is this set of
                mandibles.

     She grabs the outer mandible set.

                          SUSAN
                See?  This little piggy will grab the
                prey.

     Then unfolds a second set...

                          SUSAN
                Then this little piggy will tear it
                in half...

     And a third!!!

                          SUSAN
                ...and this little one will grind it
                to a pulp and push it in... all the
                way into the mouth.  These are
                precision tools here. Can you
                remember that?

     The guys nod.

                          SUSAN
                Good.  Then get it right.

     A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,
     revealing...

     ...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging
     sweats. He smiles at Susan.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXHIBITS

     Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a
     KNAPSACK.  A bottle of medicine marked: METALLININ.

                          PETER
                     (teasing)
                "Baby in a bottle..."

     He gives it to Susan.

                          SUSAN
                Don't tease.

     Around them, WORKMEN begin unloading crates of display stuff,
     as a MAN on a ladder tacks up an "ARCHITECTS OF NATURE"
     banner. Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a
     honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.

                          PETER
                You know where they get this
                fertility stuff?  They extract it
                from the urine of menopausal Italian
                nuns.

                          SUSAN
                     (laughs)
                Monks bottle their own wine. Don't
                they?

     She gently touches her belly.

                          SUSAN
                Trust me. I've never been this late.
                Never.

     She shakes the bottle.

                          SUSAN
                If nun's pee is what it takes...

     Peter's cellular RINGS from his knapsack. Susan grabs a
     larvae model from a pile on the floor.

                          SUSAN
                You were the one who ran around with
                ice in his underwear, don't forget
                that.

                          PETER
                Don't get kinky here...

     Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on
     the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits
     perfectly inside.

                          PETER
                Okay, meet me out front.
                     (to Susan)
                I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five.
                see you tonight.

                          SUSAN
                I'll be late.

     He kisses her and leaves. Susan turns to Siri and the group
     working on that sculpture.

                          SUSAN
                Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks
                like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are
                supposed to be made of dirt and
                excretions...

                          SIRI
                     (a wicked smile)
                Just like Trump Tower, then.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET

     A Department of Health VAN honks its way through a traffic
     jam.

     INT. VAN

     Peter's right hand man, JOSH MASLOW -- a young, good-natured,
     can-do guy -- drives.

                          JOSH
                ...So I say "buddy, you have every
                violation in the book.  Gimme one
                good reason not to close you down."
                You know what the Kraut says to me?

     In the back, Peter finishes changing out of his jogging
     sweats and into his worksuit.

                          JOSH
                The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."

                          PETER
                     (distractedly)
                Selling your sould for a fistful of
                carbohydrates...

                          JOSH
                Not just any carbohydrates, mind you.
                It was like being on the receiving
                end of some kind of transcendent oral
                sex.
                     (honks furiously)
                We should get a strobe on this thing.
                Maybe even a siren.

                          PETER
                Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can
                yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all
                going to die!"

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - DAY

     The Department of Health van pulls up outside the flophouse
     where the Chinese Preacher died. Peter and Josh get out.

     COPS push back a few ONLOOKERS. Josh proudly flashes his DOH
     badge.

                          JOSH
                Health Department...

     The cops let them pass.

                          PETER
                You really love flashing that thing,
                don't you?

                          JOSH
                Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?

     Two cops -- WOYCHEK and RICE -- approach, in no real hurry.

                          PETER
                Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were
                the first on the scene?

                          WOYCHEK
                     (gestures to Rice)
                We were both on patrol, saw this paint
                mess. Then I looked through that cellar
                window. We both did...

                          PETER
                You gone in?

                          WOYCHEK
                No. We waited.

                          PETER
                Good.

     Peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.

     Through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of PALE
     FACE AND HANDS appears, startling him.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                Get the EMT's in there, now.

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     PARAMEDIC AMBULANCES rush in. Sirens at full blast.

     Stepping out of the building across, Manny walks next to
     Chuy, who holds his hand. The old man carries a box full of
     shoes.

     Chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.

                          MANNY
                C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.
                     (discreetly crossing himself)
                Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.

     He gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.

     JOSH

     uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. A heavy
     stench emanates from inside. The cops cover their noses.

     INT. CELLAR

     Peter and Josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar,
     illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. Every
     door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty
     padlock. Peter and Josh walk through the dismal scene.

     In sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny
     metallic SEWING MACHINES and swatches of cloth appliqued with
     a FUNNY BUNNY cartoon character.

     Josh examines the label stitched into the collar. It reads:
     PROUDLY MADE IN USA.

                          PETER
                Jesus.

     His light hits a group of quivering, skeletal CHINESE
     IMMIGRANTS, standing in a tight group against a wall.

                          WOYCHEK
                     (from the outside)
                They look real sick, don't they?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. STAIRWELL, MUSEUM - DUSK

     Carrying boxes full of terrarium material, Susan and Siri
     ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  No floor buttons,
     just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever.

                          SUSAN
                ...as long as they're ready for the
                opening I don't care, just tell them
                that.

                          SIRI
                I'm on it.  Don't worry.
                     (Beat)
                Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry,
                but... I kinda overheard you and
                Peter.

                          SUSAN
                     (Smiles ironically)
                Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant
                could be on the line here.

                          SIRI
                I just...well, I had this cousin in
                Delhi.  She was having problems, too.
                She, ah...

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          SIRI
                She used a baster.

     Susan looks at her.

                          SIRI
                Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a
                turkey baster.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, Jesus.

     She tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but
     it rises just a little too far.

                          SUSAN
                Come on, darlin'...

     Susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls
     level to the floor.

                          SIRI
                     (continues)
                She kept it under her bed. Thing is,
                it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to
                hide it from her husband, but...

     A pair of young boys, RICKY and DAVIS, sit on the floor
     outside Susan's lab door.  A crumpled paper bag and a shoe
     box sit beside them.

                          SUSAN
                What's this?

                          SIRI
                Oh, right... They been here since noon.
                I told them you're real busy.

     Susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her.

                          SUSAN
                Hello.

                          RICKY
                You the bug lady, right?

     Siri chuckles.

                          SUSAN
                     (smiles)
                I suppose so.

     Ricky raises and shakes the paper bag.

                          RICKY
                We're here to deal.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - DUSK

     SUNLIGHT slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live
     and mounted dead INSECTS, trapped in turn-of-the-century
     glass fronted cabinets. Davis puts his nose up against one,
     fascinated.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes
                Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been
                upstate?

     She examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens
     of battered butterflies.

                          DAVIS
                Avenue B.

                          SUSAN
                     (sadly)
                I guess they got lost in this city.

                          RICKY
                So, you wanna buy em?

                          DAVIS
                There's extra wings in the bag.

     Siri lingers in the background.

                          SUSAN
                You guys have done a nice job.  How bout
                five dollars?

                          RICKY
                     (dismayed)
                That's it?

                          DAVIS
                     (to Ricky)
                Show her the weirdbug.

     He indicates the shoebox-

                          RICKY
                Cost a dollar just to look.

                          DAVIS
                It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a
                little...

     Siri impatiently points at the wall clock-

                          SUSAN
                Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars
                for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some
                tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you
                catch will be in better shape.

                          DAVIS
                Deal!

                          RICKY
                You crazy! That's the best!!

                          DAVIS
                Bug's almost dead anyway.

     Susan holds out two five dollar bills.  The boys can't
     resist.  Davis grabs the money-

                          DAVIS
                Thanks, lady.

     Ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box, then
     follows Davis out.

     Siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it.

                          SIRI
                Ten dollars?

     Susan places all the kid's items -including the shoebox- in
     a wastebasket.

                          SUSAN
                Alphabet City kids- there's much worse
                things they could be selling.

     Siri hits the window frame with a paperweight, gets it half
     way down.

                          SIRI
                I hate this fucking window...

     EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM MUSEUM - NIGHTFALL

     CRANE TO a nearby alley.

     A GAUNT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands in the shadows, looking up
     at Siri working on the window.

     As a streetlamp lights up, he backs up into the shadows.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. FLOPHOUSE. LOBBY - NIGHTFALL

     Religious slogans and posters are hung everywhere in what
     used to be the lobby of a men's hotel.  A hand-lettered sign:
     "NO LIQUOR, NO DRUGS, NO PROFANITY"

     PARAMEDICS are leading a number of ill CHINESE IMMIGRANTS up
     from the cellar door seen earlier.  Many are brought out on
     STRETCHERS. DOH staff put tags on their wrists.

     Peter examines a PALE OLD MAN on a stretcher while
     simultaneously talking to Josh.

                          PETER
                     (to Josh)
                There's plenty of systemic infection
                already, so as soon as we get a
                preliminary reading, start them on
                anti-biotics. You saw this?

     Peter flicks on his penlight, examines the Old Man's eyes.
     One of them is completely bloodshot. Then he shows Josh
     the gums. They're bleeding.

                          PETER
                Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have
                it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll
                quarantine them a week just to make sure.

                          JOSH
                Immigration's gonna love you for that.

                          PETER
                Tell them to send flowers to the
                usual address.

     INT. SWEAT SHOP. BASEMENT

     Peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway.

     BASEMENT SHOWERS

     A tiled nightmare. Concentration camp-cozy. A pile of old,
     rusting sewing machines clutter the floor, spilling
     oxide to a central grate.

                          JOSH
                Two shifts, people rotating from bed to
                work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart
                hell, here.

     Josh swats a fly.

                          PETER
                Did they get the sleazebag who owns this
                place?

                          JOSH
                Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people
                from Yunan. Slave labor...
                     (eyes his notebook)
                Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the
                flophouse fronting for them. No sign of
                him.

     An overhead door is opened. Daylight streams in. Peter spots
     YANG, an Asian cop, talking to a CHINESE WOMAN lying on a
     stretcher which hasn't been moved yet.  She is hollow-eyed,
     near death.  Her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for
     dear life.

                          PETER
                Tell her she's going to be alright.
                We'll take care of her.

     Peter kneels next to her, looking at her and nodding while
     Yang translates. The woman mutters again, tears of fear in
     her eyes.  Yang shakes his head.

                          YANG
                She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark
                Angels" are coming for her. She says
                they took some of her people away.

                          PETER
                Dark Angels?

                          YANG
                     (Shrugs.)
                Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man.
                They come up with some wacky stuff.

     They pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door
     and into an

     ALLEY

     The stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle, its lights
     flashing. Unseen by them, on a brick wall, nearly buried by
     graffiti, is a crude DRAWING.

     It is of the same, odd figure Peter saw drawn earlier.  The
     OVERCOAT MAN.

     INT. LAB - NIGHT - MONTAGE

     Susan and Siri, both wearing Walkman headsets, deftly mount
     BUTTERFLIES and other INSECTS onto display boards for the
     exhibit. Rain is blowing in through the half-open window.

     Their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and
     designs of the insects are beautiful.

     We understand how you can get lost in this world.  Susan
     works steadily, a partially-eaten PAY-DAY BAR and the
     wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner.

     A PAGER goes off in Susan's lab coat.

     She takes off her headset; CLASSICAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     On the PAGER's LCD screen the message reads: LATE
     TONIGHT. PETE.

     Susan puts the pager down. Goes to close the window.

     There is a loud, angry BUZZING sound.

                          SUSAN
                Siri?
                     (louder)
                Siri?!

     Siri pulls her headset off; HEAVY METAL MUSIC leaks from her
     headphones.

     The BUZZING sound again. We PAN across the various bugs and
     mounting implements till we come to rest...

     ...on the SHOEBOX the boys gave Susan. Something rattles
     wildly inside.

                          SIRI
                ...the fuck?

     Susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. It
     vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves
     inside.

     She slowly opens the lid.

     The bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded
     newspaper. Crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be
     spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's
     nest. She moves her free hand closer.

                          SUSAN
                     (To Siri)
                Can you...?

     Suddenly and INSECT big as her hand springs out of the
     shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! Minute
     pieces of paper fly through the air!!

     Susan slaps the lid back down.

                          SUSAN
                     (a scared whisper)
                Could you...help me...?

                                                            CUT TO:

     LATER

     Siri comes over as Susan grabs steel tongs and a cork
     dissecting board.

                          SUSAN
                I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to
                pin it down, okay?

                          SIRI
                What is it?

                          SUSAN
                I have no idea.  Are you ready?

     Siri nods, pins in hand.  Susan opens the lid and grabs the
     nymph with the tongs.  The creature goes berserk, flailing
     its spindly limbs, BUZZING and CROAKING, a milky substance
     FOAMING out of its body.

                          SIRI
                Oh my God...

     Susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard.

     Siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the
     tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! A spider
     trapping a sparrow.

                          SIRI
                Shit!! Get it!  Get it!

     SNAP!  It bites her hand between index and forefinger.

     Susan pins the insect into the corkboard. It spins furiously,
     like a crazy LP record.

     Susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  Siri uses more
     pins to secure it down.

                          SUSAN
                     (Noticing Siri's hand)
                It bit you.

                          SIRI
                No shit.

     SUSAN

     leans to get a closer look at the NYMPH: Deep dark brown,
     flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed.

     It squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh
     overhead light.

                          SUSAN
                This wing configuration. I've
                never...

                          SIRI
                     (looking at her injury)
                Fuck! It broke the skin...

                          SUSAN
                And they're not fully developed.  This
                thing's not even an adult.

     The nymph continues to HISS and FOAM, struggling against the
     steel pins. Susan looks closely at the insect's belly.

                          SUSAN
                My God.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Susan gestures to look.  Siri stares down at

     THE NYMPH'S TORSO

     where a SET OF VALVES on its underside click in and out.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                It's breathing.

     SIRI

     shakes her head.

                          SIRI
                That's impossible.  Insects don't...

                          SUSAN
                I know.
                     (Picks up a SCALPEL)
                Help me get a sample.

     Susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg.

     The nymph CLICKS nervously.

                          SUSAN
                Hold on, big guy, hold on...

     She traps the nymph down and CUTS THE LEG OFF.

     A painful, agonized BUZZ echoes around the room.

                                                            CUT TO:

     MONITOR

     Susan attaches the insect's leg to a samll holder. It is
     frozen in a swirl of dry ice.

     The brittle leg is then mounted in a LASER MICROTOME. Bit by
     bit, the machine executes MICROSCOPIC WAFER CUTS. Siri is
     making slides out of each section.

     A series of MICROPHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES flash onto the screen.
     In the background we hear the high-pitched BUZZ-

     We see the lights from the mounting room through a glass
     brick wall.

     INT. MOUNTING ROOM - NIGHT

     We see the nymph slowly squirming in the FG, then RACK FOCUS
     to the rain-spattered WINDOW.

     Suddenly the OVERCOAT MAN is standing on the windowsill!

     The window is lifted effortlesly from the outside.

     SUSAN

     prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear
     slide.

     Reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving
     across the room.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN

     seen only through rippled glass and reflections, moves
     through the lab.

     His body STEAMS lightly from the rain. His movements are
     quirky, spastic.

     The man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity.

     He comes to the nymph, pinned and mutilated on the worktable.
     The nymph CLICKS and CHITTERS excitedly, as if communicating
     with the man.

     He looks up at the worklight.  It seems to bother him.

     WHUMP!!! In a blur of motion, he SMASHES the light bulb.

     SUSAN

     watches the smear slide.  The blue droplets begin to CHANGE
     COLOR once in contact with the leg section...

                          SUSAN
                Hold on a second...

     ...slowly turning a deep green.

                          SIRI
                What?

     Then, THREE LARGE BEETLES fly into the room.

     Siri looks at Susan. Susan gets up, hesitant, signals for
     Siri to stay.

     We FOLLOW Susan into the mounting room.

     SUSAN'S POV

     She walks in, barely able to see her hand in front of her
     face.

     The window facing the street is wide open, rain blowing in.

     Something CRUNCHES under her feet.  She bends down, looks.

     She's stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb.

     The floor is alive with various INSECTS -- crawling, hopping,
     flying away from their displays, which have been opened.

     The nymph is gone from the board!

     She looks under the work table the nymph was on.

     We LOWER as we TRACK BACK with her.  Something is folded up
     in the corner of the ceiling behind her, camouflaged in the
     shadows, clinging impossibly to the wall.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

     He lowers himself with silent grace.

     Susan whirls.

     WHOOSH! A GUST OF WIND! A FLUTTERING SHADOW OFF THE WINDOW!

     Silence.

                          SIRI (O.S.)
                Susan?

     Susan GASPS, startled.  We SHIFT to see Siri at the door.

                          SUSAN
                Call security.

                                                            CUT TO:

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     The last DOH van takes off under the heavy rain.

     Across the street, Chuy looks down from his apartment window.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - SAME

     Chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like
     figure.  MOVING past him, we see a group of other WIRE
     FIGURES on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere.

     Manny sits at the kitchen table. He IGNITES a can of shoe
     polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame.

     He puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a
     pair of shoes. A SILLY SHOW plays over the TV.

                          MANNY
                Not too little, not too much. You rub it
                in, around and around like this. Let the
                leather take it.

     Manny leans tiredly against the table. He looks fatigued
     and in pain. He takes a small pill and places it under
     his tongue.

                          MANNY
                You watching? You should learn to
                work the shoes. You're good with your
                hands...

     Manny shoots a glance over to his grandson.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...you gonna get all wet.

     Chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street.

                          MANNY
                Did you look at the story book I got you?

     Manny lifts a brightly colored CHILDREN'S BOOK.

                          MANNY
                Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that,
                Chico?  "Friends"?

     Nothing from Chuy.

     CHUY'S POV - STREET

     The building across the street. Yellow DOH tape at the
     entrance.

                          MANNY (OS)
                A friend is the one you can trust.  When
                you are with a friend, no matter where in
                the world, you are at home.

     A FIGURE moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain
     toward the entrance.  It is the OVERCOAT MAN, barely visible
     in the rain.

                          MANNY
                In this city. A friend is a hard thing to
                find...

     CHUY

     His face shows a bit of animation.

                          CHUY
                Funny Shoes...

     Manny looks up from the book.

                          CHUY
                Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Manny comes over, looks out.

     THEIR POV

     The figure has disappeared into the dark front of the
     boarded-up building.

     MANNY AND CHUY

                          MANNY
                No one is there. Is empty.

     Chuy doesn't respond.  Manny turns the boy's face to his.

                          MANNY
                Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on
                the cross, but that is not a holy place.
                You understand?

     Chuy looks at him blankly.  Manny sighs; he knows he doesn't.

                          MANNY
                Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in
                your head, eh?

     He pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. Chuy
     turns back to stare at the street.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes...

     EXT. OUTSIDE TYLER APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     The D.O.H. Van pulls up in front of a modest Pre-war
     building. Josh and Peter climb out.

     Peter is reviewing a roster.

                          PETER
                Josh, what was Immigration's
                countdown?

     Josh hands Peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes
     and running shoes.

                          JOSH
                Thirty-three workers.

     Peter hands him the roster.

                          PETER
                There are thirty five listed in the
                reverend Wong's roster...

                          JOSH
                Shit.

     Peter walks up the front steps.

                          PETER
                Remember what that woman said, about
                people being taken? Check with the
                copsin the area.

     INT. TYLER APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Peter enters the apartment, which has long since been
     remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger TV with slightly
     better reception.

                          PETER
                Sus?

     No answer.  He notices the dining room table is filled with
     yellowed FILES, all marked JUDAS TRADITOR.

                          PETER
                     (Looks around once again)
                Susan?

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM

     Peter comes in to find Susan sitting in a chair before a
     dryer, quietly watching laundry whirl within.

                          PETER
                     (Regarding the laundry.)
                Thought it was my week for that.

                          SUSAN
                     (Shrugs.)
                I needed to think. It was either this
                or the weather channel.

     Peter walks over, kisses her.  He notices an open book of
     INSECT MORPHOLOGY on her lap. There's a FULL COLOR
     PHOTOGRAPH of an OOTHECA -- an insect eggcase.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER

     Peter folds laundry into his/her piles.  Susan paces.

                          SUSAN
                This thing was the size of my fist,
                Peter!! That's off the charts!

                          PETER
                Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

                          SUSAN
                Don't you get it? It's more than
                that.

     Peter takes a bedsheet. Susan helps him fold it.

                          SUSAN
                You know why insects don't grow larger?
                Because they don't have a complex
                respiratory system. What I saw did. It
                had lungs.

     Peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  The two
     begin to fold it together.

                          SUSAN
                Evolution doesn't work that fast.
                Something pushed that thing to take the
                leap. We need to find another specimen.

                          PETER
                We?

     As they fold the sheet, they move closer together.

                          SUSAN
                I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.

     The folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to
     face. Susan finishes folding herself.

                          SUSAN
                There's only two species who match the
                enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant
                in the Amazon...

     She has his full attention now.

                          SUSAN
                The other we released here two years ago.

     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - AVENUE B - DAY

     A TAXI CAB makes a U turn and cruises on.

     INT. CAB

     Susan ignores the yakking Armenian DRIVER as she scans
     the buildings and empty lots-

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                Avenue B... again! Maybe you got
                wrong letter, uh?

     The cabbie looks up at a Manhattan street map glued over
     his head on the roof of the cab.

                          SUSAN
                Keep going. We'll tell you when to
                stop...

                          PETER
                Maybe they lied to you.

                          SUSAN
                Even if they did... that's all we
                have, isn't it?

     The cab cruises past the tenement buildings, nondescript
     stores, junked cars and rubble-strewn lots. It stops
     before a traffic light.

     A LEERING HOMELESS GUY with a greasy rag and greasier
     cleaning solution approaches the windshield.

                          ARMENIAN
                No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!

     The Homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield
     with his dirty rag. The driver sends him away.

     The light turns green.  The Driver accelerates, turning
     on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by
     the guy.

     Susan sees something.

                          SUSAN
                Pull over!

                          ARMENIAN DRIVER
                What...?

     Susan motions excitedly.  The Driver pulls over. Susan
     gets out.

     EXT. OUTSIDE CAR

     Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield
     wiper.

     A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.
     She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.

                          SUSAN
                Metaxonycha Godmani.

                          PETER
                So?

     Susan looks around.  Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by
     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
     performance artists.

     An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.

     EXT. EMPTY LOT

     Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small
     urban wilderness.  Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them
     from the weeds.

                          RICKY (OS)
                If you want your money back, forget it!

     Peter and Susan look up.  The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE
     CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.

                          DAVIS (OS)
                We already spent it!

     Susan walks forward.

                          SUSAN
                We're here to deal.

     Long beat.  The door to the clubhouse swings open.

     A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND.

     At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the
     busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously
     nearby.

                          PETER
                Here, let me...

     He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a
     PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-
     brown colored EGGCASE.

                          SUSAN
                You sure you didn't see one of these?

                          RICKY
                Gross. What is it?

                          SUSAN
                An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had
                more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

                          RICKY
                     (shakes his head)
                No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.

     Davis opens the door with a CLICK.

     INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM

     A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers.

     Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-
     limits area.

                          DAVIS
                It was in that corner over there.

     Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS.

                          RICKY
                Sucker was fast, man.
                     (Picks up a pipe.)
                Had to take it out with one a these.

                          PETER
                Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.

     Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it
     slyly.

                          RICKY
                Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops
                you're here.

     Peter regards the little scam artist dryly.

                          PETER
                Let's keep it at five and I won't
                condemn your clubhouse.

     Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys
     take off.

     Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket.

     Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES
     where the sinks used to be.

     PETER

     inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects:
     chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared
     heroin syringes.

     Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up.

                          PETER
                     (quietly)
                Look, a broken tooth...

     Something rustles nearby.

     He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It
     seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it.

     SUSAN

     kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there
     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off
     the tile walls.

     Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening.

     Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.
     She starts pulling something out.

     PETER

     at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it...

     ...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly
     camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.

     Peter recoils.

                          SUSAN (OS)
                You okay?

     He nods.

     SUSAN

     turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC
     NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of
     beads fall away...

     ...rolls under the locker...

     ...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going
     deeper till they comes to a stop.

     Susan peers where the beads fell.

                          SUSAN
                There's something under here.

     Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of
     beads and throws them at the base of the locker.

     CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way
     under.

     A moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it
     BOUNCING on cement. He shines his light inside.

     INT. HOLE - PETER'S HAND

     Very dark. A highlight glints off a shell-like surface.

     The light barely touches it.

     THE WHOLE SURFACE BACKS AWAY.

     Peter drops the penlight.  It gets stuck in a jutting piece
     of concrete.

     PETER

                          PETER
                Shit.

     Peter tries to get his hand in

     DEEPER

     But he cannot reach the light. It is literally inches from
     his fingers...

     SUSAN

                          SUSAN
                Let me try.  My hands are smaller.

     She kneels and goes for it.

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     Her hand reaches for the penlight.

     She barely touches it.  The penlight spins around.  Its light
     now illuminates...

     THE FACE OF A MAN.  Unseen by Susan.  Terrifying in its doll-
     like simplicity.  In the darkness, its features seem
     indiscernable, inert, almost frozen in a perfectly
     symmetrical pattern.

     It regards the spiderlike movement of Susan's fingers.

     SUSAN'S

     face squinches with the effort.

                          PETER
                Honey, just leave it.

                          SUSAN
                No, there's...

     INT. HOLE - SUSAN'S HAND

     As Susan's hand moves closer, the strange Face begins to
     TREMBLE.

     A CLICKING SOUND.

     Susan's hand is almost there.

     SUSAN

     reaches further.

     And suddenly A BEAM OF LIGHT cuts through the darkness.

     Their vision resolves. The figures of two MTA COPS stand
     before them:  ERNEST, 50, burly and bull-necked; and LEONARD
     -- African American, 45, more formidable than fat.

                          LEONARD
                     (Wearily)
                Now don't tell me.

     INT. HOLE

     Susan's hand withdraws.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                You lost a token, right?

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATER

     SHH-SHH-SHH.  A felt rag is expertly being pulled across a
     set of pristine black shoes.

     REVEAL Leonard sitting like a king in a chair, getting his
     shoes shined by Manny.  He leans back laconically while
     arguing with Peter. Ernest examines the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                Look, I showed you my badge...

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot
                bigger one you wanna go down there.
                That's the old maintenance grid, Doc.
                Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...

                          PETER
                The Department of Public Health...

                          LEONARD
                ...should know better'n to go sneakin'
                around my turf...

                          PETER
                Fine.  You want me to call your
                supervisor?

                          LEONARD
                Please do.  He's a lonely guy.

     Uninterested, Leonard looks over to Susan and Chuy.

     ANGLE ON SUSAN

     She leans against the wall, inspects her dirty hand. Ernest
     gives her his handkerchief.

                          CHUY (OS)
                Gucci.  Flat pump.

     She looks down at Chuy, who sits nearby, holding a PAIR OF
     SPOONS.

                          ERNEST
                Your shoes.

     She stares down at her shoes.  Gucci flat pumps, all right.
     Susan smiles.

     Just then, a SUBWAY TRAIN pulls up.  The doors open,
     disgorging passengers. Chuy flips into action.  He starts
     playing his spoons, CLICKING them together, slapping them
     against his knee.

     Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons
     to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the
     VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN,
     the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY.

                          SUSAN
                     (Laughs.  To Chuy.)
                That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?

     Chuy doesn't answer.

                          ERNEST
                No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.

     Ernest discreetly points to his forehead.

                          MANNY
                     (immediately)
                He's special.

                          LEONARD
                He can imitate anything, you just watch
                him.

                          PETER
                     (Irritably, to Leonard)
                Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

                          LEONARD
                No, you talkin' at me.

     Leonard hands Manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and
     walks past Peter as if he were invisible.

                          ERNEST
                     (discreetly, to Susan)
                Is there some reward for this?

                          SUSAN
                I guess that could be arranged.

     Ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two-
                bit bureaucratic, territorial number
                on me?

                          LEONARD
                You wanna keep up the conversation, you
                best come back with the proper permits
                and the right attitude.

     Leonard saunters away with Ernest in tow.

     Peter shakes his head angrily.  He takes Susan by the arm,
     heads off in another direction.

     Chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of
     their steps.

     INT. SUBWAY STAIRS - DAY

     Susan and Peter walk up the stairs; Peter still fumes.

                          PETER
                You give someone a fucking uniform
                and... Did you hear how he talked to us?

                          SUSAN
                I heard how you talked to him.

                          PETER
                Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?

     Susan spares him an ironic look.

                          SUSAN
                He was just doing his job.

                          PETER
                Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!

     At the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by
     sunlight.

                          PETER
                He wants a permit, I'll get him a
                permit.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS - DUSK

     A train blurs by.

     A FLASHLIGHT BEAM over dirty gravel.  TILT with the beam to
     see Ernest walking his beat past TRACKS and GIRDERS.  Hulking
     out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light
     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.

     A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING.

     He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.

     A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage.

     He touches the lump with his shoe.  It STIRS slightly.

     He touches it again...

     ...and a PAIR OF LEGS suddenly LASH OUT, kicking at him
     reflexively.

     Ernest jumps back.

     Another SET OF LEGS emerges...

     Oddly enough, Ernest relaxes.

                          ERNEST
                Chrissakes...

     He grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  We see that
     it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP.

     Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated,
     toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim
     light, they almost seem like a single organism.

                          ERNEST
                Guys, c'mon.

     The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.  Ernest starts
     getting annoyed.

                          ERNEST
                I told you to stick by the maintenance
                area.

                          BAG LADY
                Nah... It's private property now.

     Ernest looks at her, confused.

                          SKELETAL BUM
                He eats down there.

                          ERNEST
                Who?

                          HOMELESS MAN
                The Stickman.

                          BAG LADY
                Long John.

     The homeless man points.  Ernest turns his light.

     Another SILHOUETTE of the OVERCOAT MAN drawn on the wall. An
     arrow below it points east.

                          ERNEST
                Graffiti artist, uh?
                     (To Homeless People)
                Look guys, just get off my beat, you
                hear?  Get moving.

     Ernest hustles them out.  The homeless people glare at him,
     pick up their things and head into the gloom.

     Ernest watches them go.  He turns back to the graffiti
     painting of The Stickman.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER

     Ernest walks deeper into the tunnels. Dusklight slants in
     weakly from grates above.

     He stops as a RUMBLE is heard ahead of him  He ducks into a
     recess in the wall.  The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER.

     A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its
     HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal...

     A FIGURE crouched over something.

     We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds.

     CU ERNEST

     Squinting to see over his flashlight beam.

                          ERNEST
                Hey, buddy!

     No answer.  Just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and
     ingested.  Ernest is revolted.

                          ERNEST
                Get off my track...

     The crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a
     unusually quick BLUR OF MOTION.  It's the OVERCOAT MAN.

     Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff
     of hot wind that signals an approaching train.

     Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance.

     The Overcoat Man stands up.

     Ernest stops in his tracks.

     For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT
     in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood.

     A dead dog.

     The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his
     chest...

     ...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING
     FROM HIS TORSO.

                          ERNEST
                Sweet Jesus...

     The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He
     begins walking toward Ernest.

     Ernest backs away.

     The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS
     PAST!

     CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful
     arms.

     Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the
     dark figure, then raised above, taken away.

     TRACK

     The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS.

     The track is empty again.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. EXHIBITION HALL - BANNER

     We PAN across the banner:  'ARCHITECTS OF NATURE'.

     INT. EXHIBITION FLOOR

     EXHIBITS under glass set up throughout the room: Insect
     chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc.

     An opening night CROWD of affluent MUSEUM PATRONS.  All
     tuxedoes and painted smiles.  Some peremptorily peruse the
     displays; most just camp out at the buffet table.

     Peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  He scans the
     room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet
     table, drinking an orange juice.  He goes over to her.

                          PETER
                Heya.
                     (Kisses her on the cheek.)
                Where's the boss?

     Siri gestures to the far end of the room.  Susan stands
     alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ANT MOUND exhibit.

                          SIRI
                Ant mound.

     Peter notices Siri seems unusually weary. She covers one
     of her eyes.

                          PETER
                You okay?

                          SIRI
                It's just a headache.  We were
                sandblasting Trump Tower here since
                four this morning.

                          PETER
                Maybe you should sit...

                          SIRI
                I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could
                use a good word right now.

     She nods for him to go ahead.  Peter leaves.

     Siri closes her eyes.  She rubs the bandage around the
     insect bite on her hand.

     PETER

     approaches Susan.  She's staring through thr glass panes
     of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  In the
     refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem
     to blend into one another.

                          PETER
                Great crowd.

                          SUSAN
                No such thing, baby.

     She looks over at the crowd congregated around the
     buffet table.

                          SUSAN
                I get the feeling they came more for
                the potroast than the apterids.

                          PETER
                Fuck 'em.  They don't know what
                they're missing.

                          SUSAN
                     (Distantly)
                Right.

     Peter looks at her.

                          PETER
                What's wrong?

     Susan sighs.

                          SUSAN
                Oh...nothing that a little
                menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't
                cure. Least that's what I thought.

     Peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on
     her stomach.

                          PETER
                     (genuinely moved)
                Oh, no, you were-

                          SUSAN
                I was just late.

     Susan nods.  Peter takes her hand. They sit by the ant
     mound.

                          SUSAN
                Ironic, don't you think?  These guys
                can hatch hundreds of offspring in a
                single clutch of eggs, right? And
                here we are...

                          PETER
                Susan, we're not b-

                          SIRI (OS)
                Susan?

     Susan looks up to see Siri standing on the other side of
     the glass case.

                          SIRI
                     (Weakly.)
                I'm sorry.  I think...I need...

     One of her eyes is completely bloodshot. Her mouth is
     bleeding. She puts her hand on the case to steady
     herself.

     Her fingers leave a STREAK OF BLOOD on the glass.

                          SUSAN
                Siri...

     Siri collapses.  The exhibit tips over.

     Peter pulls Susan out of the way just as the exhibit
     FALLS AND SMASHES TO THE GROUND!

                          SUSAN
                Siri!

     The room erupts into COMMOTION.

     Susan and Peter run to Siri, who lies unconscious on the
     floor.

     Peter gently turns her over.

     Siri's BLEEDING from the corner of her mouth.  Just like
     the Chinese workers in the sweatshop.

     Tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

     An ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant
     hospital.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     Siri is rushed on a gurney toward the Emergency Room.

     Peter and Susan walk next to it talking to DR. CHRIS
     RAYMOND, a 35-year old ER physician.

                          PETER
                ...I think it's some kind of systemic
                infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases
                like it yesterday. A sweatshop in
                Canal.

                          RAYMOND
                     (to Peter.)
                Okay, look.  You better come in with
                me.  Help me through.

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM

     Raymond, Peter, and several other ER STAFF work on Siri,
     now lying on an operating table.

                          RAYMOND
                     (To Peter)
                All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the
                dril?

                          PETER
                It'll come back to me.

     RAYMOND inspects Siri's wounded hand.  The bandage has
     been removed.  The bite-wound is infected and
     suppurating.  A large red circular RASH around it.

                          PETER
                Looks like a Lyme disease rash.

                          RAYMOND
                It's not consistent with the internal
                bleeding. Any idea what bit her?

     Peter shakes his head.

                          RAYMOND
                I think we're gonna need to have that
                specimen here.

     An ASSISTANT finishes inserting a catheter down her
     throat.

     Blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube.

     ABOVE THE OPERATING THEATER.

     Staring down through the circular glass deck, Susan
     silently observes the procedures.

     Salmon-colored LIGHT slants in from sodium vapor streetlight.
     PAN through the shadowy room, past Manny's sleeping form to
     Chuy, asleep under a tent made of an old Star Wars blanket.

     A RHYTHMICAL CLICKING SOUND is heard from outside.

     Chuy pops his head out from under the blanket, listening.

     EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

     Wearing only his pajama bottoms, Chuy steps out on the fire
     escape with his spoons in hand.

     The CLICKING RESUMES from the building across the street.

     OVERHEAD VIEW

     The barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the
     center of the huge PAINT STAIN on the sidewalk.

     The CLICKING sound comes again.

     STREET LEVEL

     The CLICKING comes again from inside the flophouse.  It
     continues a little bit, then stops.

     Chuy CLICKS his spoons together, mimicking the sound.

     Beat.  A CLICKING from within again; almost an answer.

     Chuy ducks under the yellow DOH tape, walks toward the front
     of the building.

     He comes to the boarded entrance.  There is a hole, narrow,
     and low in the doorway.

     Chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.

     INT. FLOPHOUSE - LOBBY

     Chuy steps into the lobby.

     The CLICKING comes again, from further inside.

     Chuy moves to find it.

     CHAPEL

     Bits of STREETLIGHT slant in.  Chuy walks slowly, listening.

     He steps into the SHADOW of a LOOMING FIGURE.  He turns...

     CHUY'S POV - CRUCIFIX

     We start on bleeding, nail-pierced feet, then TILT up the
     twisted body to the face of Jesus, looking down.

     CHUY

     stares without emotion at the plaster figure.

     MOVEMENT to his side.  He turns again.

     A dimly-lit FIGURE stands before him.

     Shapes fold and regroup in the darkness, resolving into the
     tall figure of the OVERCOAT MAN.

     The Man begins to emit the CLICKING NOISE from under his
     chin, his whole head VIBRATING.

     Chuy smiles.  He has a beautiful smile.

                          CHUY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     He plays his spoons, imitating the sound the figure made.

     He is answered...but this time, it's from the other side of
     the room. We PAN as he turns.

     ANOTHER OVERCOAT MAN appears in the shadows.

     Chuy GIGGLES, delighted.

                looking for.

                          PETER
                You said that thing was big as your
                hand.  I don't think I'm going to

                Why take the chance?  Just let me go
                down there with you...

                          PETER
                No.

     Susan glares at him.  Peter sits down by her.

                          PETER
                Susan, listen to me:  you handled
                that insect almost as much as Siri...

                          SUSAN
                It didn't bite me.

                          PETER
                I know.  But if it was carrying
                something...there's a chance you
                could have been exposed.

     Susan is silent.

                          PETER
                Chris is going to run some blood
                tests on you.  I want you to stay here
                till he's absolutely sure you're
                clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me...
                You'll catch up with us...

     Susan looks up at him. Finally, she nods.

                          PETER
                We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.

     He leans over, kisses her gently.  But Susan seems
     hardly reassured.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - PREDAWN

     The blue hours before dawn. Laconic movement outside.  New
     York dragging itself out of bed.

     We FIND Manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot
     plate. He addresses Chuy's tented bed behind him.

                          MANNY
                My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get
                a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you
                that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!

     Manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them
     in a star-shaped pattern. A breakfast ritual of some kind.

                          MANNY
                Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em,
                Chu-chu...
                     (He pours a glass of milk.)
                We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to
                pick some up tonight, okay?

     He walks over to Chuy's tent bed. He pulls the sheets aside.

     His grandson is gone.

     EXT. SEWAGE FILTRATION PLANT - PREDAWN

     Sewage water BUBBLES in huge tanks.

     A WORKMAN walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the
     larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling
     hooks.  Shoes, tires, rags...

     A GRINDING SOUND is heard.  The Workman YELLS out to a
     CONTROL BOOTH above.

                          WORKMAN
                Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.

     SOUND of the pump coming to a halt.

     The Workman walks to the filter area.  He sinks his grappling
     hook into the polluted waters.

     UNDERWATER SHOT

     Spooky, silent. The grappling hook moves like a scythe to the
     filter...

     ...past long, soft filaments of RAGGED TISSUE...

     ...and connects with a LARGER FORM.

     ABOVE WATER

     The Workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  He gives a
     YANK, hooking whatever it is.

     He begins pulling it up.

     A PALE FORM bubbles to the surface.

     The Workman's face goes pale.

                          WORKMAN
                Oh, God...

     A grating VOICE from the control booth is heard over the P.A.

                          CONTROL BOOTH
                          VOICE
                What's the problem?

     It take the Workman a moment to speak.

                          WORKMAN
                I think it's a baby!

     The Workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)
     toward the edge of the tank.

     He bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.

     The Workman SCREAMS.

     His grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

     Susan watches Siri from behind a pane of glass.  Siri is
     connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by
     several machines.

     Raymond approaches Susan, two cups of coffee in his
     hands.

                          RAYMOND
                How you feeling?

                          SUSAN
                You tell me.

     He smiles, gives her one of the cups.

                          RAYMOND
                Your blood tests were all negative.
                You checked out.

     Susan visibly relaxes.  She looks back at the ICU ward.

                          SUSAN
                What about Siri?

                          RAYMOND
                She's stable.  I don't think there's
                any immediate danger, but we'll have
                to keep her under observation...

                          SUSAN
                You think it's some form of
                Strickler's, don't you?

     Beat.  Raymond shrugs.

                          RAYMOND
                Pathology's still working on the
                tissue samples.  If it is...it must
                be an errant strain.  Shorter
                incubation period.

                I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know
                yet.

     INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM

     At the sink, Susan runs water over her hands, her face,
     trying to collect herself.  She looks up in the mirror.
     We see that her eyes are swollen, tear-stained.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

     She walks out of the ladies room, drying her face with a
     paper towel.

     SOUNDS of a nearby argument catch her attention.

                ...how many times I gotta tell you,

                Well, what the hell else am I suppose
                to do with it?

     Susan heads in the direction of the voices.

     INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY NEAR MORGUE

     An ORDERLY (JEREMY) argues with an EMT.  Their point of
     contention:  a small FORM lying on a stretcher.

                          JEREMY
                Take it out back and throw it in the
                friggin' dumpster!

                Not unless somebody signs for it.

     Susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form.

     Her eyes go wide.

     Jeremy hesitates.  But if her tone wasn't enough, the
     stare she gives him certainly is.

                          JEREMY
                Okay.

     Jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall.

     Susan approaches the stretcher.

                thought it was a baby. They called
                us.

     Susan bends over it.  She covers her mouth and nose at
     the stench.

                          EMT
                It's a lobster, right?

     But it's not.  What lies on the stretcher before them
     looks more like a demon from a Brueghel painting.

     A THREE FOOT INSECT.  It's mephitic, pink-white body is
     rotten, falling apart.  The head's intact, with strange,
     large jaws thrown wide open. The chitin on one is half
     gone.

     Peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of
     lockers clear--the locker section tips and falls with an
     ENORMOUS BANG, which echoes loudly off the tile walls. Dust
     flies everywhere.

     When the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

     Water DRIPPING from overhead, ECHOING footsteps- very
     spooky.  Leonard leads Peter and Josh down the tunnel-

                          LEONARD
                You all watch your step.  We got some
                burrows goin' down seven stories
                here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to
                come pick you up.

                          JOSH
                     (Whisper to Peter)
                New York's finest.

     Monumental archways give way to naves as big as Notre Dame.

     Josh flashes the ultra-violet light over an abandoned
     underground encampment, made of cardboard walls, electrical
     wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. The walls are completely
     taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and
     messages. Everything from "Kilroy was here" to
     elaborate quotations from the bible.

                          JOSH
                There's really people living down here?

                          LEONARD
                Mole people. This section was pretty
                popular, all the way to Fulton Street...

     Their flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust. The air is
     heavy.

                          LEONARD
                Substance abusers, mental cases... Then
                about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors
                got started... Someone found a couple of
                stiffs...

     They work their way down a steep incline. They're covered in
     sweat.

                          LEONARD
                Down here's the land of talk, see? So the
                wildest version goes the farthest. They
                mark that area with a sign or a drawing,
                and its as good as closed.
                     (chuckles)
                We had one fella... for years said he was
                Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo.

     Peter's cellular rings. He picks up -big static-

     INTERCUT WITH:

     MORGUE

     Susan's got the phone up on her shoulder, clamped against her
     ear. Raymond's cranking out a bunch of Polaroids. Color shots
     of the insect, from every angle.

                          SUSAN
                It's me. Can you hear me?

                          PETER
                     (phone, barely audible)
                Yeah, barely. We haven't found
                anything down here. Nothing...

     Jeremy goes to the fridge for a beer.

                          SUSAN
                I have.

     The fridge light plays over the large insects jaws. It makes
     out a few new ridges and valleys. Raymond snaps a couple of
     Polaroids.

                          SUSAN
                I'm on my way. I've got something for you
                to look at...

     Susan notices something weird and undefinable about the
     contours of the claws... But she can't put her finger on
     it.

     BACK AT THE TUNNEL

                          PETER
                We'll be back at the platform in...

                          LEONARD
                20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing
                anymore.

                          PETER
                     (To phone.)
                20 minutes.
                     (Beat.)
                Susan?

     The call is lost. Peter tries to change frequencies, but it's
     useless.

     Peter replaces the phone in his pocket.  He walks off.

                          LEONARD
                Funny.  Shoulda seen some track
                bunnies by now.

                          JOSH
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're
                usually around.

     No one notices the OVERCOAT MAN carving on the wall.

     INT. MANNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     On Manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has
     accumulated. The radio is playing a sad, elegiac Tango.

                          MANNY
                No, no, please understand... I can't
                wait that long.

     Looking disheveled and tired, Manny clutches the phone,
     listening intently.

                          MANNY
                Please. I write it down.
                     (he writes)
                2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean
                "case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When
                can you...?

     He holds a color snapshot of Chuy sitting on a mailbox.

                          MANNY
                No, I can't wait...no, listen...

     Click. Manny slowly hangs up. He stares at his notepad, at
     the number 2873.

                          MANNY
                Hijos de puta.

     He crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window,
     picks up Chuy's last wire figure-

     FIGURE, CLOSER

     Another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with
     something slightly off about it.

     It has six limbs instead of four!

     MANNY

     frowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street.

                          MANNY
                Mr. Funny Shoes.

     Distant thunder is heard.

     BATHROOM CABINET

     Manny takes a STRAIGHT RAZOR from the bathroom cabinet, opens
     the blade.

     EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

     Susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway
     station. A COUPLE passes her on their way up.

     A sign over the entrance says "STATION WILL CLOSE FOR REPAIRS
     AT 3 PM - TOKENS ONLY". Susan looks around- the area is semi-
     deserted, a bit creepy.

     She takes a deep breath, descends.

     INT. SUBWAY - DAY

     Susan pushes through the turnstile, enters the long corridors
     of gleaming tile, a somewhat de-humanizing atmosphere,
     straight out of a George Tooker painting.

     Very creepy.  Susan's footsteps ECHO in the empty tunnel.
     She sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder- nobody is
     following her-

     PLATFORM "A" DELANCEY

     Susan observes the locker room door impatiently. A small crew
     of REPAIRMEN are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights.

     She sits and waits.

     INT. DEEP IN TUNNEL

     Peter, Josh and Leonard walk through a darker area. The
     floor beneath them suddenly changes, becomes tile.

                     (Sniffing)
                Smells like acid.

     Peter stops, looks around.

                          PETER
                Ammonia.

     Josh walks to the right, where the smell seems to emanate
     from.  At last they come to

     INT. VAULTED AREA - CONTINUOUS

     Josh LIGHTS a flare, sets it on the ground, walks ahead.  The
     ominous RUMBLE of a subway is heard in the distance.

     A cracked WATER MAIN above.  Water dribbles to the ground.

                          JOSH
                Peter...

                          PETER
                Yeah...?

                          JOSH
                There's some weird shit here.

                          PETER
                Weird shit...?

                          JOSH
                Take a look.

     Leonard shines his flashlight ahead.

     Revealed, quite literally, is a world of shit.

     LARGE FECES scattered everywhere:  on the floor, hanging
     sausage-like from the ceiling.  One can almost taste the
     stench of old ammonia.

     Peter puts on a rubber glove, inspects one of the fecal
     stalactites.

                          JOSH
                Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird
                shit.
                     (Beat)
                Whatever it is, it's not human.

     Josh breaks off a sample, drops it in a jar with a hard
     THUNK.  Leonard turns away in distaste.

                          LEONARD
                And it needs some metamucil.

     EXT. FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

     It's raining like hell. Manny approaches the abandoned
     flophouse.

     He peeks through the boarded-up front entrance. Right there,
     on the dusty lobby floor, clearer than the larger
     shoeprints...

     ...he discovers a trail of tiny, barefoot prints.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     He kicks experimentally at the planks, but they're far too
     strong.

     ALLEY

     Manny explores the opposite face of the building, looking for
     a way in.

     A DOG is BARKING incessantly. Manny turns.

     Something moves in the shadows!  Something long and thin,
     haloed  by the rain.

     It moves again, the streetlight touching it for a fleeting
     moment as it totters around to the rear of the building.
     It's The Overcoat Man!

     The man hurries past. Manny sprints after him.

     ALLEYS

     Manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates.

     There is the OVERCOAT MAN.

     CARGO WORKERS mill around a group of vegetable trucks,
     unloading produce.

     The OVERCOAT MAN attracts no attention. Keeping his head
     down, staying near the shadowed buildings. Jumping and
     hopping, he skitters into an alley.

     FOLLOWING

     Manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure. He
     pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue.
     Once it takes effect he moves on.

     The OVERCOAT MAN has moved past a chainlink fence. How??
     It's too high!!!

     The old man squeezes through a jagged opening. The metal
     fabric cuts his shirt.

     On the other side: a dead end. Nowhere to go except
     for...

     A SEWAGE GRATE

     Manny lifts it.

     SEWAGE PIPE

     Manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty. He
     flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor.

     This pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt.
     Something moves under a wet newspaper: a thick mass of long-
     legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor.

     Suddenly...the distant sound of spoons playing.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     Manny pulls a rosary from his pocket, wraps it around
     his wrist and crosses himself with the razor...

     ...then begins to move down the pipe.

     Susan examines the Polaroids.  She pulls out a payday bar.

     The crew of repairmen are leaving.

                          REPAIRMAN
                Hey, Lady, all power will be down in
                five minutes, okay?

                          SUSAN
                Okay....

     She munches on the bar. She stops: one snapshot has caught
     her attention.  The fridge light illuminated this photograph.

     Susan turns it around... and around... Trying to find
     something different in the lines.

     A train roars by.

     Then she notices it:

     THE POLAROID

     The closed jaws. They look like A HUMAN FACE.

     SUSAN

     Gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room.

     A whole row of lamps goes off. The rest flickers in and
     out.

     Then we see, now standing on her platform: THE OVERCOAT MAN!!
     He looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon
     lights.

     Susan tries the locker room door. It's unlocked.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - SUSAN

     carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers.

     She kneels to examine the hole in the wall.  She nears a
     noise.

     THE OVERCOAT MAN is moving toward her.

                          SUSAN
                Peter?

     OVERCOAT MAN

     The man's face TIPS BACK...

     ...raising the complex, glittering INSECT HEAD FROM BEHIND
     ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS.

     Its multi-parted MOUTH clicks OPEN.

     Susan SCREAMS!

     The thing charges, its "coat" opening to reveal...SIX
     LEATHERY WINGS, fully extended! The wingspan blocks the
     whole tunnel, they vibrate rapidly.

     Susan tries to run, but the creature -- hereafter known
     simply as "The Mimic" -- LEAPS ONTO HER CHEST!

     She's dragged screaming into the hole.

     Their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs,
     wings and pipes.

     INT. VAULTED AREA

     Peter and Josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack.

     Leonard stands at the other end of the area. He inspects some
     OLD SCAFFOLDING set up at an opening which leads to

     THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION

     fifteen feet below.

                          LEONARD
                I've never been this deep. This area
                here is the Old Armory station. They
                built it in the 40's. Ran out of money
                half-way through...

     It's like Grand Central's dead little brother. Tiled mosaic
     walls, columns, monumental arches. Spaces for shops. A group
     of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel
     tracks.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.

     Everything is gray with dust.

                          PETER (O.S.)
                     (To Josh)
                I want a team in here by six tonight,
                hands and knees with toothpicks...

     Leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding.

     A NYMPH -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile
     of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound.

     Keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, Leonard coolly bends
     down, picks up a ROCK.

     PETER

     putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up
     and sees

     LEONARD

     step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the
     nymph.

                          PETER
                Don't!!

     SMASH! Leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it.

     Peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.

                          LEONARD
                Did you see the size of that thing?!

                          PETER
                Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-

     A CREAK from the scaffolding at their combined weight.

     Leonard grabs Peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding.

     CREEEEAAAAAK!

     THE ENTIRE SCAFFOLDING GIVES WAY!

     Buckling diagonally...

     ...taking Peter and Leonard with it...

     CRASH!  Both Peter and Leonard are thrown to the ground of
     the station below.  The scaffolding falls around them.

     JOSH

     rushes forward.

                          JOSH
                Peter!

     PETER AND LEONARD

     stir in the wreckage.  Peter rises shakily.  He puts his
     glasses on. One of the lenses is badly smashed.

                          PETER
                It's okay.  I'm all right.

     He tries to help Leonard up; Leonard knocks his hand away.

                          LEONARD
                Get the hell away from me!

     Peter looks up at Josh.

                          PETER
                     (Deadpan)
                He's all right, too.

     Leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie-talkie.
     It's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires.
     He curses under his breath.

     Peter checks the wall for a handhold.  But there's only
     smooth tile and dust.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, that's gonna work.

                          PETER
                You got a better way up?

     Leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to Josh.

                          LEONARD
                     (To Josh.)
                Show that to the station manager.  Tell
                him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt
                he don't have someone down here in ten.

                          JOSH
                H-how do I get...?

                          LEONARD
                Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to
                your right...

     Leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. Josh
     hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                Go left.  Go left again till you hit the
                fork... Then right again. You got that?

                          JOSH
                I think so. One right, two lefts...

                          LEONARD
                And a right.

                          JOSH
                Right.

                          PETER
                Go Josh. Now.

     Josh obeys.

     INT. NICHE

     We hear a persistent BEEPING...

     A concrete ROOM filled with glimmering debris. Cans,
     eyeglasses, fake teeth, chrome, foil, glass shards, broken
     watches.

     Susan lies unconscious, half-sunk in a mulch of decomposing
     food, old newspapers, plastic garbage bags.  An inch of brown
     WATER burbles past her bloody head.

     SOMETHING jostles her, rocking her back and forth.

     Her eyelids slowly open.

     A HUGE MIMIC IS PERCHED ON HER BODY!

     Its WINGCASE is drooped around her like a shroud. The
     creature furiously tears at her jacket, trying to get at
     Susan's beeper.

     The beeper spills from her pocket along with several Pay Day
     bars.  The Mimic CRUSHES the machine instantly, then chomps
     up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles.

     Susan watches in terror as the creature steps away.

     A SOUND from an adjacent tunnel.  Susan looks...

     ...and sees ANOTHER MIMIC pulling the REMAINS OF A MAN into
     the darkness.

     Susan gropes around her in the soggy debris, looking for some
     weapon.

     SUSAN'S HAND

     Her fingers close around a three-foot piece of RUSTY PIPE.

     Something dark drips on her hand.

     SUSAN

     looks up. Above her, a badly decomposing HUMAN FOOT, or what
     is left of it.  All part of the excarnated corpse of the
     Chinese Preacher.  His gold cross shines boldly in the dark.

     Susan GASPS.

     THE MIMIC

     hears the sound.  It immediately SKITTERS back to her.

     SUSAN

     jerks herself sideways...

     AND STABS THE PIPE into the Mimic's thorax with a wet CRRK!

     Susan heaves herself up, pushing the thing onto its back.

     The Mimic BUZZES furiously, milky WHITE FOAM pumping from the
     wound.  Its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself.

     Susan runs for the tunnels, debris falling from her clothing.

                                                            CUT TO:

     JOSH

     comes to a t-junction.  He checks his notepad for the
     appropriate direction.

     He turns, heads left.

     INT. TUNNELS

     Susan staggers through a dark PASSAGEWAY.  Water drizzles
     into her grimy face.  She looks up.

     Rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up.  She can
     see the SHOES of PEOPLE walking to and fro above.

                          SUSAN
                HELP!!!

     EXT. STREET ABOVE - NIGHT

     Life as usual on Delancey street.

     Pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their
     umbrellas.  Traffic noise, T.V. displays on street front
     stores, boom boxes, car horns...

     They drown out the tiny sound of Susan's voice...

     SUSAN

     hears distant FEET SCURRYING toward her, punctuated by a
     metallic CLANG!  CLANG!  CLANG!

     SIDE TUNNEL

     CLANG!  The metal pipe, still imbedded in the Mimic, BANGS
     the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.

     SUSAN

     looks around frantically.  She crosses to a METAL LID on the
     floor, lifts it.

     A HOLE is below, dropping off into darkness.

     The Mimic's CLANGING grows louder.

     Susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the
     metal lid by handles on its underside.

     The Mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...

     Susan JUMPS into the hole, hanging onto the lid...

     WHANG!  The lid SLAMS SHUT over the hole a fraction of a
     second before the creature reaches it.

     The Mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.

     INT. HOLE

     The TICK-TICKING of the Mimic's antennae scanning the lid.

     Susan hangs from the handles on the lid, her arms trembling.

     Susan's strength gives out.  She lets go, falls.

     PIPE GALLERY

     Susan CRASHES onto a juncture between two large PIPES.

     She MOANS in pain.

     CLOSER - SUSAN

     secures her position, looks down.  A seemingly bottomless pit
     below, crisscrossed with a FOREST OF PIPES AND DUCTS.

     The nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach.

     She is trapped.

     Then she hears the SOUND of the LID OPENING above.  She holds
     her breath.

     A faint YELLOW LIGHT of a lighter flickers down at her.

                                                            CUT TO:

     WET SECTION

     Josh cautiously enters a vaulted area.  Old pipes have been
     ripped from the walls.  WATER gushes over the steel-plated
     walls.  He looks around- this doesn't seem familiar.

     Josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal PLATE
     on the wall.

     He yanks at the plate- it gives a little bit. He yanks
     harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging
     precariously from a loose bolt.

     It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.

     He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the
     tunnel behind him-

     JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL

     A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the
     floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.
     Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the
     water and the light of a flare.  It stops-

     JOSH

     Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his
     eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a
     narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT
     coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through
     the opening-

     MIMIC

     The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if
     mesmerized by its flow-

     PIT - JOSH

     With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.

     He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered
     around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the
     sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He
     looks up-

     Above him is a grate.  He's come to the SHOWER ROOM of the
     sweatshop!

     INT. SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a
     corner.  We TILT to see Josh moving the grate away.  He
     jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-

     HIS HANDS SLIDE!!

     PIT

     Josh puts the old sewing machine upright.

     OUTSIDE

     Suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the
     steel plate hits the ground: KLANGG!!

     THE MIMIC

     leaps into action!

     PIT - JOSH

     hears the CLICKING, fairly close.  He shines his light back
     down the hole he entered through-

     JOSH'S POV - THE MIMIC

     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.

     JOSH

                          JOSH
                Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

     He stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for
     the floor above-

     SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM

     Josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  His
     arms tremble. He makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab
     the POWER CORD of one of the abandoned sewing machines.

     THE MIMIC

     rushes through the opening without even slowing down.

     JOSH

     pulls himself up, up-  WHAM!  The Mimic hits the lower part
     of his body, BLOOD spraying up through the hole.  He SCREAMS,
     grasps the cord with both hands!

     He is brutally YANKED down into the hole, the sewing machine
     tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges
     violently in the hole!

     We track over to reveal, one of Chuy's perfectly
     executed WIRE SCULPTURES. Sitting atop another sewing
     machine.

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. REMAINS OF THE SUBWAY STATION

     A ring of FLARES burns in the darkness like an island.  Peter
     lights another one, revealing a space buried in layers of
     dust and time.

     Cracked MANNEQUIN FACES stares out from an unopened TAILOR
     SHOP.  A FLOWER PARLOR decorated with cobwebs.  A yellowed
     NEWSPAPER on the floor, its headlines reading:  GERMAN TROOPS
     DRIVEN BACK ACROSS RHINE.

     Peter looks up to see Leonard approaching from the track.

                          PETER
                Any luck?

                          LEONARD
                Well...there's an old service elevator
                half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna
                be much use, though.  Lines are dead.

     Peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which HUM
     ominously with electricity.

                          PETER
                You said those cables're still live.
                Can't we rewire...?

                          LEONARD
                Oh, man, there you go again.

                          PETER
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Those things bring juice to the new
                stations.  You just can't rewire that
                shit...

     Peter approaches him.

                          PETER
                For Chrissakes, what's the problem?
                You need a memo every time you fart?

                          LEONARD
                All right, motherfucker, that's it.

     He pushes Peter violently. Their eyes lock and meet.
     Inches away from a fistfight.

                          PETER
                Shh! Shh!

     A SOUND rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the
     second.

     Where is it coming from?

     Peter looks at Leonard.  Leonard unbuttons his holster clip,
     places his hand on his .22

     A SHADOW appears outside the archway.

     It steps onto the platform.

     Leonard frowns.

                          LEONARD
                     (tentative)
                Manny?!

     The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. A
     rusted crowbar in his hand.

     Leonard walks over to him solicitously.

                          LEONARD
                My God, what the hell are you...?

                          MANNY
                Hurry, the woman needs help!

     A shadow crosses Peter's face.

                          PETER
                Woman?

     INT. PIPE GALLERY

     OUTSTRETCHED HANDS in the darkness.

     REVEAL Peter leaning across the void with one hand while
     Manny and Leonard grip his other.

     Susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing
     pipes. A mess, but still alive.  She reaches up to Peter.

     It's too far.

                          SUSAN
                     (A whisper)
                Don't.

                          PETER
                Listen to me:  we're getting you out.

     Leonard and Manny pull Peter back into

     INT. TUNNELS

     Peter undoes his belt.

                          PETER
                     (To Manny and Leonard)
                Give me your belts.

     They obey. Peter buckles them together with his. He then
     loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.

                          LEONARD
                     (to Manny, as he ties them
                     together)
                What are you doing down here?

                          MANNY
                Chuy. He was taken. He's down here
                somewhere...
                     (to Peter)
                Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was
                after her.

                          PETER
                What's...?

                          MANNY
                Just hurry.

     Peter takes his word for it.  He uses the belts to lower
     himself to the nearest pipe.

     Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.

     Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede
     into Hades.

     The lifeline tightens.

     Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his
     stomach and lets the belts down.

                          PETER
                I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.

     But then, he sees something move below her. Then a hollow
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

                          SUSAN
                No, Jesus, no.

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Toss the flare down!

                          LEONARD
                I only got...

                          PETER
                Just do it!

     Leonard lets the flare drop from his hand.

     It falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes,
     spinning down to the pitch-black below.

     And for a split second the flame illuminates...

     THE MIMIC

     pipe in its thorax, nimbly CLIMBING THE PIPES TOWARD SUSAN
     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     PETER'S

     eyes grow huge.

                          PETER
                Oh, Jesus...

     LEONARD

     just plain loses it.

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is
                that?!

     SUSAN

     knows all too well what's coming for her.

                          SUSAN
                     (A desperate appeal)
                Peter...

     Throwing caution to the wind, Peter reaches the belt down.

                          PETER
                Wrap it around your hand!

     Susan at last gets a grip.  Peter pulls with both arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! Getting closer.

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes,
     ascending foot by foot...

     Peter pulls her into his arms.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter bends down.

                          PETER
                Get on my shoulders!

     Susan steps onto his shoulders.  He pushes her up...

     And Leonard and Manny yank her out.

     CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

     Peter scrambles up, SLAMS the lid back on the hole.

                          PETER
                Let's go!

     The four of them run.

     HOLD ON the lid.

     WHAM! It bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.

     INT. ABANDONED PLATFORM

     The four humans run down the empty platform.  Peter spares a
     look back.

                          PETER
                Oh, shit...

     Far down the tunnel,

     THE MIMIC HAS SPREAD ITS WINGS AND IS FLYING AFTER THEM!!

                          MANNY
                There!

     He points to the open DOOR of an ancient SUBWAY CAR.

     They sprint for the car, get to the door.  Manny, Peter,
     Leonard, then Susan...

     INT. SUBWAY REPAIR CAR

     ...tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty
     crates.

                          LEONARD
                Get the goddam door!

     Leonard and Peter both grab its handle, slide it shut...

     SPLACK!  The Mimic crashes into it!

     KLANGGG!  The door bulges out from the impact, almost
     tearing itself off the hinges.

     Susan jumps back.  Manny runs to cover her.

     The creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and
     forelegs waving wildly!

     The abdomen CRASHES through a pane of glass.

                          PETER
                Push it! Push it! Don't let up!

     Leonard and Peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.

     THE UPPER HALF OF THE MIMIC TEARS ITSELF LOOSE.

     WHITE BLOOD SPATTERS everywhere. The Mimic is NOW CUT IN
     HALF!

     The wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety
     window's outer panels.

     But the FRONT SECTION IS STILL ALIVE.  It scrabbles in,
     spraying white blood...

     ...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor
     and under a row of shelves in a half-circle around the car
     till it finally comes to a halt.

     Silence.  The only sound is a SKITTERING outside.

     Susan looks outside the window.

     The Mimic's REAR HALF IS STILL TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE
     DOOR, its feet blindly dragging along.

     LEONARD

                          LEONARD
                What the fuck was that?

     Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt.

                          LEONARD
                You better tell me what the hell's
                going on here!

                          MANNY
                Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!

                          PETER
                     (to Leonard)
                We don't know!! We don't know what it
                is!

     Leonard releases Peter and, cocking his gun moves closer
     to the still thing.

                          PETER
                Wait a minute-

                          LEONARD
                Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm
                going to-

     SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its
     front mandibles.

     A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work the
     leg like a grinder-blender.

                          LEONARD
                GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!

     Peter and Manny try to pull the thing off as Leonard falls
     and writhes on the floor.

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The men flinch away as Leonard empties his
     guns on it, until the thing's shell finally CRACKS!

     But the thing is still locked onto Leonard's leg.  Peter
     tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. No good.

                          PETER
                Its muscles are locked.

                          LEONARD
                     (Hoarse)
                Oh, Jesus!!

                          MANNY
                Wait...

     Manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts
     smearing the stuff onto the Mimic's head and jaws.

                          LEONARD
                Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get
                it off!!

     He lights a CIGARETTE LIGHTER, goes to touch the flame to the
     flammable stuff.

                          PETER
                     (Stopping him.)
                Hey hey hey...

                          MANNY
                Is how we make loose the ticks back home.

     Peter hesitates, but lets him go.  Manny lights the polish.

     WHOOSH...the Mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. THE
     LEGS LOOSEN THEIR GRIP.

     Peter and Manny yank it free from Leonard, who's PASSED OUT
     from the pain.  His leg is torn and bloody.

                                                            CUT TO:

     We now see the car is 50's vintage.  A POSTER of Mickey
     Mantle above an empty worktable.

     Peter sits before Susan.  She's trembling, understandably
     shaken from her previous experience.  BLOOD pours from a CUT
     on her forehead.

     Peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then
     tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.

                          PETER
                Just keep holding it.  Can you do that
                for me?
                     (No reponse.)
                Susan?

     Susan nods silently.  Her hand weakly presses the compress.

                          MANNY (OS)
                Doctor Tyler?

     He turns to Manny, who sits solicitously next to Leonard.
     His wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. He begins to
     stir.

     Peter gets up, but Susan's hand is closed tightly around his,
     like the jaws of the Mimic.  He kisses her gently, then
     slowly manages to release his hand.

     He walks to Leonard, inspects his wound. Touches the sole of
     his foot.

                          PETER
                You feel anything?

                          LEONARD
                Yeah, I feel like ripping your
                fucking eyes out...

                          PETER
                Leonard, listen.  I need to see if
                there's any nerve damage before we
                carry you back.
                     (No response.)
                Look, I'm trying to help you here...

                          LEONARD
                Oh, you helped me here, all right, white
                boy.  You and your goddam memo. You
                needed to prove your point, uh?

                          PETER
                I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you
                bleed to death is the best apology.

     Peter touches his foot again. Leonard finally nods.

     Manny gazes at the Mimic carcass at the end of the car.

                          MANNY
                Where the hell'd that thing come from?

     Peter looks at Susan.  She remains silent.

                          PETER
                     (Quietly)
                A mistake.

                          LEONARD
                "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?

                          PETER
                It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.

                          LEONARD
                How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin'
                around with its buttside gone and a
                fucking pipe through its heart...

                          SUSAN
                     (Quietly)
                It doesn't have a heart.

     Peter looks up at her.

                          SUSAN
                Just inner chambers...

                          MANNY
                But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

                          SUSAN
                No...

     She gets up, finally moving.

                          SUSAN
                That's what it wanted you to see.

                                                            CUT TO:

     OUTSIDE CAR

     The subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly
     glowing in the dark. The door opens, and Manny and Peter
     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.

     INSIDE CAR - A LITTLE LATER

     The lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.
     Susan is reassembling it.

                          PETER
                So, you're saying this is like those bugs
                that -- that look like twigs or leaves
                or...

                          SUSAN
                     (shakes her head)
                That's camouflage...

     Susan displays the partly-charred head.

                          SUSAN
                This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic
                their predators. A butterfly can look
                like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar
                can copy a snake...

     Susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained
     bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.

                          SUSAN
                This has evolved to mimic the most
                dangerous predator it's ever had...

     She holds it in her hand, like Yorick's skull. The mimic's
     head obscenely mirrors her own. She inserts it into the
     shoulder cavity.

     She stands back.

                          SUSAN
                Us.

     CAMERA cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like
     THE OVERCOAT MAN.

                          SUSAN
                Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas
                that code...

                          MANNY
                     (quotes)
                "...and behold he will come that walks as
                a man, yet is not a man- ..."

                          SUSAN
                This, is our baby Peter. Yours and
                mine. Aren't you proud?

     OUTSIDE OF THE CAR - IN THE TUNNELS

     We see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and
     ceiling...

     ...heading towards the car...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     A SUBWAY MAP on the wall.  Red, blue, and orange lines
     branching through the boroughs like veins.

                          SUSAN
                All these...they're like tunnels of an
                insect colony. Once these things hit a
                certain population density, they'll have
                to move out, form new colonies.

     The realization hits the others.

                          SUSAN
                We have to get help down here.  Burn
                the tunnels before...

     She's interrupted by a CLICKING from the tunnel ahead.

     It's answered by CLICKING from the tunnel behind.

                          LEONARD
                Get the doors!

     A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS to
     close in time.

                          PETER
                Is there a switch?

                          LEONARD
                Third rail is dead.
                     (To Manny and Susan.)
                Get me up.  There must be a manual
                override in the booth.

     Manny and Susan help Leonard up.

                          SUSAN
                     (Whispering to Peter)
                The lights!

     Peter turns off the flashlights.

     Susan and Manny help Leonard to the car's CONTROL BOOTH.

     Peter looks

     OUTSIDE

     where the silhouette of a MIMIC moves to the rear of the car.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard opens a box on the side-wall marked MANUAL OVERRIDE.

     Inside, there is a large, HEXAGONAL SHAPED HOLE.

                          LEONARD
                     (Starts looking around)
                Where's the damn crank?!

     OUTSIDE

     The Mimic is only yards away.

     OTHER SHADOWS emerge from the distant dark.

     INSIDE

     Manny leaves Leonard and Susan to look for the lever crank.

     He runs to help Peter try and shut the doors manually.

     But it's useless.  Many of the doors won't budge.

                          PETER
                     (hissing a whisper)
                They're coming!

     OUTSIDE

     The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder...

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED
     ROD.  The lever crank.

                          SUSAN
                I got it!

     Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal
     shaped hole.  Perfect fit.

     Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and
     slow...

                          SUSAN
                Hurry! Please!

     THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR

     The doors begin to swing shut very slowly.

     OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV

     sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her
     hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as
     possible.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up
     the closing process.

     SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close.

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank
     one more time...

                          LEONARD
                Come on, you son-of-a...

     SUBWAY CAR

     A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON.

     Silence.

     All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the
     blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the

     WINDOWS

     caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the
     red flares.

     THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door.

     A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof.

     The car SHAKES.

     OUTSIDE

     The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.

     INSIDE

     SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a
     nail over a chalkboard.

     THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides...

     An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car.

     PETER

     A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face
     is reflected in a security window.

     CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection.

     ABOVE MANNY

     Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent.

     BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD

     Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in.

     Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of
     the clicking...

     ...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, God.
                     (Looks at Leonard.)
                The blood...

     KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them!

     Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as

     IN THE SUBWAY CAR

     KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling!

     SUSAN AND LEONARD

     emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's
     shoulder.

                          SUSAN
                His blood! It's driving them crazy! We
                have to mask the odor!

                          PETER
                How?!

     But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.

     Leonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around
     his wound to mask it. Manny helps.

     Peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken
     window as a barricade.

     Despite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the
     scent.

                          PETER
                It's no use! They know we're in here!

                          SUSAN
                They don't know anything Peter, they
                just sense. They're hardwired!

                          PETER
                Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's
                not like them!

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

                          SUSAN
                Exac...

     She looks over at the severed Mimic corpse nearby.  A
     realization...

                          SUSAN
                     (To Manny)
                Give me your razor.

     Manny looks at her blankly. Susan just takes the blade.

     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.

     She runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she
     hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice.

     She SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor...

                          PETER
                What are you doing?

     ...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...

     ...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of
     softballs.  She SLICES them open.

     Orange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering.

                          LEONARD
                     (covers his nose)
                Shit!

     Peter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Rub it on the windows!

                          PETER
                What-

                          SUSAN
                Just do it!!

     Holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the
     crap on the windows, the doorframe...

     MANNY

     looks to the roof, listening.

     And remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START
     SUBSIDING.

     Susan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on
     Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink.

                          LEONARD
                What are you putting that crap on me
                for?

                          SUSAN
                Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to
                identify themselves to each other.

     She smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds
     down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.

                                                            CUT TO:

     SUBWAY CAR - LATER

     Leaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak
     for every Mimic he sees.

     Peter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has
     created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris
     and the wall map.

                          LEONARD (O.S.)
                Okay. That's us.

     Manny's lighter represents the subway car.

                          LEONARD
                This track we're on? Goes down into
                the repair area.
                     (Makes an "X" further down)
                The elevator's over here. Leads up to
                the active tunnels.

     THUMP! An oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against
     the glass. Manny moves away.

                          PETER
                Can we get this car there?

                          LEONARD
                Someone'd have to go to the
                switchroom, pull the coupling lever,
                that'll send us left and to the
                elevator.

                          SUSAN
                But the power...

                          LEONARD
                Hell, I might be able to juice the whole
                area, if I can get to the power box. It's
                just a couple of cables...

                          MANNY
                Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard?
                Hop?

                          PETER
                     (To Leonard)
                Just talk me through it. I can go with
                Manny.

                          LEONARD
                It would take a minute or so.
                     (beat)
                You won't last that long out there.

                          SUSAN
                Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

     Tense silence. He points at the glands on the floor.

                          PETER
                We'll cover ourselves with this. They
                can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!

                          SUSAN
                Peter-

                          PETER
                It worked before...

                          SUSAN
                     (an edge in her voice)
                The scent won't last...

                          PETER
                That's why we should do it now.

     Susan knows they have no other choice.

     LATER

     Susan is stuffing Leonard's old bloody bandages into the
     thorax of the dead Mimic.  She ties a flare to its center.

                          LEONARD
                It's just a regular old pump switch,
                okay? Right by the track signal
                board.

     Manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on
     himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them-

                          LEONARD
                The lights come up, you pull the
                switch.

                          MANNY
                I pull.

                          LEONARD
                You don't do that, we're on the wrong
                track.
                     (turns to Peter)
                You...

     The two men look into each other's eyes.

                          LEONARD
                You gonna finally get to fuck around
                with the wires.  Think you can
                handle it?

                          PETER
                Depends.  You got a memo?

     Leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost
     imperceptible smile.

     Using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back
     of Peter's hand.

                          LEONARD
                All right then.  You gonna find two
                wires.  One's green.  The other's
                blue...

     SUSAN

     approaches Manny, who looks distractedly out the window.

                          MANNY
                He's out there. I heard him. How can
                he be? This things...

                          SUSAN
                Manny...

                          MANNY
                I didn't protect him, lady. He
                trusted me. And I didn't protect
                him... His father...I lost his father
                to the streets and now, Chuy...

                          SUSAN
                We'll find him. We'll be back and
                find him.

     Manny doesn't respond.

     READY TO GO

     Susan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the
     scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she
     speaks.

                          SUSAN
                You're going to have to keep it
                really slow.  Their eyes react to
                sudden movements.

     Peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He
     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops
     him.

                          SUSAN
                Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes,
                try not to sweat.  They can sense
                chemical changes...

                          PETER
                Try not to sweat?

     Leonard turns to Susan and Peter.

                          LEONARD
                Okay, people...

     Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.

                          LEONARD (OS)
                ...are we ready for this?

     Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep
     breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's
     an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.

                          LEONARD
                Whatever you do, don't step on the
                third rail coming back. Six hundred
                volts'll blow your leg right off.

     A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get.

     He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.

                          PETER
                I was just thinking how I could use a
                pair of pliers... and I remembered where
                they are...

                          SUSAN
                     (overlapping)
                That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.

     A sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face.

                          PETER
                In the tool box under the kitchen
                counter...

     Susan kisses him softly on the lips.

     Manny approaches.  Show time.

     Susan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control
     booth.

                          SUSAN
                Open it.

     LEONARD

     begins turning the lever crank slowly.

     SUBWAY DOORS

     gradually begin to open, and stop half way.

     The darkness outside is alive with CLICKING.

     PETER AND MANNY

     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their
     way to

     INT. PLATFORM

     They step onto the dusty concrete.  Come to a stop.

     SUSAN

     watches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics

     OUTSIDE

     LARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none
     of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other.

     Peter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's
     working.

     Peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER
     BOX.

     Manny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the
     platform to the SWITCH ROOM.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass,
     filled with the bloody bandages.

     PLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS

     Peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering
     to himself.

     He lowers himself slowly to the track.

     PLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM

     Manny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS
     reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter gets to the track.  He turns

     And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!

     Its antennae move toward his head, curious.

     Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.

     Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...

     SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard has now fully opened the doors.

     SUSAN

     pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's
     midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive.

     The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics
     outside.

     Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of
     the car...

     ...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.

     OUTSIDE

     The other Mimics take instant notice.

     BY PETER

     The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,
     it's gone, heading toward

     THE DEAD MIMIC

     stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow
     into a feeding frenzy.

     The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother
     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches in disgust.

                          SUSAN
                Choke on it, motherfuckers.

     Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to
     shut.

     PETER

     breathes a sigh of relief.

     He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.

     He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.
     The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO
     THE GREEN WIRES.

                          PETER
                     (to himself)
                Green...Blue...

     He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.

     All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic
     casings having long ago faded into goo.

     INT. SWITCHROOM

     Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of
     the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White
     Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s
     style LAMPS are built into their side.

     Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the
     rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.

     Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he
     waves back to LEONARD.

     He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands
     are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills
     scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans
     against the wall.

     A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the
     entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.

     It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.

     Spoons.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...?

     Manny follows the sound.

     BY THE TRACK

     Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.
     He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance
     of color.

     He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.
     Breathes...

     INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

     The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and
     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.

     Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.

     Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet
     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.

     A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around.

                          MANNY
                     (Whispering)
                Nino...

     He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before
     the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless
     smile on his pale face.

                          MANNY
                Chuy...

     BY THE POWERBOX

     Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now
     to the fuse-section.

     A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.

     One is still occupied.

     The other one empty.

                          PETER
                Dammit!

     CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD

     BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan watches the Mimics at their feast.

     All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.

                          SUSAN
                     (horrified)
                The scent's fading...

     Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.

                          LEONARD
                     (tense as hell)
                What's Manny doing? I can't see him
                anymore.

     ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM

                          MANNY
                Nino, please...

     Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture
     of "come to me".

     In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND
     floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw
     gestures as it falls through the air.

     Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm
     frond.

     It's a wing.

     Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.

     The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of
     a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the
     females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic
     clusterfuck.

     Manny is sickened.

     CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face
     falls.

                          MANNY
                Dios mio...

     The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING...

     ...unfolding...

     ...at last revealing...

     AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution...

     Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more
     supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still
     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to
     them that at the very least entrance us.

     The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny
     boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.

     Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.

     The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as
     if trying to communicate with the boy.

     Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a
     perfect imitation of the sound.

     Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with
     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-

                          MANNY
                     (barely audible)
                Chuy...

                          CHUY
                     (whispers)
                Friends.

                          MANNY
                NO, NO, CHUY, NO...

                          CHUY
                Friends.

     The Albino CLICKS his jaws, moving in toward Manny.

     CHUY

     plays his SPOONS in perfect imitation.

     MANNY

     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. He raises his
     arms, like a prophet. He lets go of hsi razor and kneels.

                          MANNY
                God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot
                see...

     His vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange
     serenity invades him.

     The Albino's jaws open and charge.

     PLATFORM

     Some Mimics advance toward Peter's direction.

     SUBWAY CAR

     Susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,
     trying to attract their attention.

                          SUSAN
                Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter BREAKS the arm off one of his glasses.  He jams it at
     the empty fuse.  It SPARKS.

     PLATFORM

     THUMP!  The electricity COMES ON...

     The lamps on the columns BURST INTO FLAMES from the power
     surge.  Fire illuminates the station like a Greek temple.

     BY THE TRACKS

     Peter climbs up onto the tracks...

     ...sweat staining his forehead...

     Peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.

     THE MIMICS

     clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees
     reacting to honey.

     SUBWAY CAR

                          SUSAN
                     (to Leonard)
                THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

     LEONARD

     looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which
     button to press. He begins to press each one in turn.

     PETER

     hears the sound of spoons playing.

     He turns to see Chuy, standing by the outside of the switch
     room.  The boy smiles. A flashlight shines behind him.

                          PETER
                Manny...

     But the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:
     The ALBINO steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung
     puppet. His claws and jaws are coated in blood. Chuy joyfully
     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.

     THE MIMICS

     climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-

     SUBWAY CAR - CONTROL BOOTH

     Susan runs in.  SLAMS her hand down on a button.

     FSST!

     THE SUBWAY CAR

     The doors open.

                          SUSAN
                Peter!!

     Peter hesitates, takes a step toward Chuy.

                          PETER
                Come on, kid...

     Chuy seeks shelter behind the Albino's legs.

                          PETER
                     (horrified)
                Jesus!

     The albino charges toward him.

                          SUSAN
                Run!! Peter!!

     Peter bolts for the car.

     THE MIMICS

     jump and land

     SUBWAY CAR

     just as Peter squeezes through one of the doors.

     BAM! THUD! The doors dent. Glass cracks.

                          SUSAN
                     (Yelling to Leonard)
                GO!!

     Susan presses the button. The doors close again.

                          LEONARD
                The kid...

                          PETER
                The kid's with them!!

                          LEONARD
                What do you-?

                          PETER
                Go!! Just go!!

     CONTROL BOOTH

     Leonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board.

     SUBWAY CAR

     JOLTS into action.

     OUTSIDE

     The train LURCHES forward.

     Wheels spark and kick into gear. The mimics scramble and re-
     assemble quickly, ready to attack.

     THE ALBINO

     changes position and charges towards the car.

     THE MOVING CAR

     reaches a "Y" section.  The car moves to the track to the
     right.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     Leonard's eyes go wide as he sees

                          LEONARD
                He didn't do it!

                          SUSAN
                What?

                          LEONARD
                Manny never threw the coupling switch!!
                We're goin' the wrong way!!!

     OUTSIDE CAR

     It keeps bearing right. Further away from their destination.

     ...towards an old STORAGE YARD in their path.  Idle cars and
     repair equipment on the tracks.

     A crash seems inevitable.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Leonard pulls

     THE BRAKES

     but they don't work at all.

     From below the car we see the wheels spinning freely,
     heading for collision.

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Susan grabs Leonard from the control booth. To Peter

                          SUSAN
                MOVE BACK!!!

     They rush back against the opposite door.

     STORAGE YARD - SUBWAY CAR

     CRAAASHH!!  The car BASHES into a parked section of train in
     a GRIN of tearing metal...

     ...flips off the track...

     ...and onto its side...

     The car skids to a stop.  SPARKS fill the air.

     INSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     All three are hurt.  Leonard's leg wound has reopened. Peter
     has badly damaged his right arm.

                          SUSAN
                You all right?

     Peter nods painfully.  Susan to Leonard.

                          LEONARD
                     (Simply, re: his leg)
                Can't feel it.

     Peter and Susan sling Leonard's arms over their shoulders.
     They raise him up.

     OUTSIDE SUBWAY CAR

     They move unsteadily outside.

                          SUSAN
                Which way?

                          LEONARD
                Across both tracks!!

                          PETER
                Shit.

     They head off over a concrete island in the direction of the
     correct track.

     FURTHER BACK

     The Mimics and the Albino moving closer.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     try to hurry, but it's no use given Leonard's condition.

                          LEONARD
                     (Quietly)
                Lemme go.

     Peter and Susan both disregard the order.

                          SUSAN
                We're no leaving you!

                          LEONARD
                No way we can outrun 'em together.
                Move it!

     Leonard suddenly grabs his POLICE BATON from his belt
     clip.  He pushes the two away.

                          LEONARD
                NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat!

     Leonard turns away from them.

     Peter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA
     officer is staying put.

                          LEONARD
                Come on.  Come to poppa.

     Reluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel.

     LEONARD

     takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FURTHER DOWN

     Peter and Susan run.

                          SUSAN
                There.

     An open CAGE ELEVATOR on a platform nearby.  A sign overhead:
     AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

     They rush toward it.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - "Y" SECTION

     Leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth.

     SOUNDS of the Mimics approaching. He glances at the third
     rail beside him, then down the track.

                          LEONARD
                Come here, you mealy-mouthed...

     The sound gets louder.

                          LEONARD
                Multi-legged...

     Leonard raises his baton in top MTA form.

                          LEONARD
                Maggot-munchin' motherfu...

     THUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard!

     Leonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton.

     They begin to tear at his limbs.

     Leonard rolls...

     ...kicks his good leg out...

     ...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL.

     AN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming
     Leonard and the Mimics.

     INT. BY THE CAGE ELEVATOR

     The crackling sound echoes through to Peter and Susan.

     Susan hits the elevator button again.

                          SUSAN
                I can't tell if it's working!

     Peter has unbarred the gate.

     SUSAN

     looks up, into the shaft.

     THE ELEVATOR

     coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.

                          SUSAN
                Oh, come on, come on!

                          PETER
                Jump in.

     Peter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate
     behind them.

     INT. SHAFT

     A skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a
     handhold.

     Peter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.  She
     balances on the narrow ledge.

     Peter SLAMS the cage door shut, latching it.

                          PETER
                You go first. I'll be right below you.

                          SUSAN
                Your arm, you can't...

                          PETER
                I can.  We can do this...

     He shows her the first hand and foothold.  Susan grabs on.

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

     The Albino amkes its way forward, flanked by two Mimics.

     It stops.

     Turns toward the elevator.

     INT. SHAFT

     Susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by
     handhold. Peter is right below her.

     She can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously
     with the effort.

                          SUSAN
                We're gonna make it!

     Peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next
     handhold.

     WHAM!  Something hits the gate below them!

     INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE

     The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate.

     The Albino remains still, watching them work.

     PETER AND SUSAN

     Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts
     catching in her throat with the effort.

                          PETER
                Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going,
                even flow!

     Susan tried, but can't.  She tries to pull herself up to the
     next level.

                          PETER
                C'mon...

                          SUSAN
                Ah...

                          PETER
                Talk to me.

                          SUSAN
                Peter...

     Susan pulls herself up.

                          SUSUAN
                I'm really glad I'm not pregnant.

     REVERSE

     We look down past them as they climb.  Two of the Mimics and
     the Albino have gotten into the shaft!

     The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against
     opposite walls.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     Susan is crying, barely any strength left.

     Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is
     barely hanging on himself.

     LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE
     TALKING and a muffled P.A. ANNOUNCEMENT filter down.

     MIMICS

     rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     Peter's hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next
     floor.

     KCHUNK! is heard above them.  Peter looks up.

     Now the elevator is coming down.

                          PETER
                Hang onto me.

     Peter pulls Susan up till she can grab it too, both of them
     able to get a foothold on the ledge-

                          PETER
                Hang on tight!

     He begins to KICK on the gate, trying to tear it free.  Susan
     looks back down.

     SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT

     The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its
     mandibles.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through
     to the

     INT. SUBWAY TRACK

                          PETER
                Come on!

     Peter and Susan stumble away.

     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

     The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above.

     It gives a few CLICKS to its minions.

     The two other Mimics race up the shaft...

     ...toward the elevator...

     ...and WEDGE THEMSELVES IN ON EITHER SIDE!

     They are CRUSHED instantly.  But the elevator is stopped just
     above the open gate.

     With just enough room for the Albino to get through to

     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS

     Susan and Peter run.  There is LIGHT just up the tunnel.  We
     hear VOICES.

                          SUSAN
                Don't look back!

     They go for it.  At last, they make it to

     INT. A PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter stumble forward.  Light streams down from
     overheads. Susan turns.

     SUSAN'S POV

     The Albino spills out onto the track behind them.

     Sleek, streamlined, light glancing beautifully off it.

     SUSAN AND PETER

     turn back...

     HEADLIGHTS hit them as we hear the ROAR of a SUBWAY TRAIN
     heading at them from the other side of the platform!

                          SUSAN
                No...

                          PETER
                We can do it!

     They run.

     ALBINO

     runs, faster than any other Mimic.

     TRAIN

     The express train BLOWS its HORN, RUSHING FORWARD.

     PLATFORM - COMMUTERS

     Weary late-night COMMUTERS stand half-asleep on the tracks.
     A sleepy-eyed little girl points, tugging on her mother's
     hand.

                          LITTLE GIRL
                Mommy, there's people...

     PETER AND SUSAN

                          PETER
                     (Adrenaline pumping)
                We-can-do-this!!!

     MOTORMAN

     The driver sees the battered couple...

     He reaches for the brake...

     SUSAN AND PETER

     They reach the edge of the platform, the HORN deafening as
     the train speeds toward them.  Peter pushes Susan up, leaps-

     INT. TRAIN - CONDUCTOR

     We RUSH toward his horrified face.

     THE ALBINO

     directly ahead.

     The train, still flying, PLOWS INTO IT...

     ...flattening, grinding, pulverizing...

     ...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white
     blood.

     The motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in
     primal horror. The train SQUEALS to a stop...

     ON THE PLATFORM

     Susan and Peter collapse on the cement floor in each others
     arms.  Heaving and weeping.

     INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

     COMMUTERS turn to stare as Peter and Susan move across
     the floor.  Both bruised and bloodied, leaning against
     each other, heading for the exit.

     Some DERELICTS observe them with curiosity.

     A trio of MTA cops start towards them.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... it... They're still
                down there. We'll seal the whole
                system, go in with whatever it
                takes...

     But Peter's voice evidences a lack of conviction now,
     he's trying to convince both Susan and himself of
     something he doesn't fully believe.

                          PETER
                It'll be fine... We nailed them
                before, we'll do it again...

     He hurries to meet the MTA cops. Susan looks up.

     SUSAN'S POV

     Commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and
     out of the illuminated areas of the station.

     In the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face-  a MIMIC,
     hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment!

     We PAN 180 degrees to the other side of the platform-
     there, briefly glimpsed is ANOTHER, and ANOTHER.

     We TILT down to the throng below.

                          SUSAN
                     (barely audible)
                They've come up...

     The electrified VOICE of the train ANNOUNCER suddenly
     FADES UP, telling of departures and delays-

     We raise above Susan's head-

                          TRAIN ANNOUNCER
                The 11:16 local to Poughkeepsie,
                boarding now, Track 32- the 7:20
                Connecticut local, making
                connections to South Norwalk-

     DOWN ANGLE

     -culminating in an OVERHEAD VIEW of the main terminal.

     The movement continues. But from here, the people are
     dots, their importanec no greater than that of a colony
     of ants.

                                                          FADE OUT:

1A   INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION                             1A   

     A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform    
     somewhere in Harlem.                                                

     A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African      
     American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.      

     He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards     
     the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.        

     Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,    
     searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the     
     public restroom and runs inside.                                    


1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1B   

     The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed        
     while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -                 

     The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of    
     the dark.                                                           

     The man checks each stall one at a time.                            

     His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-                 

     A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO       
     CRAWL THROUGH.                                                      

     He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.     
     After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-        

     A wall of bricks.                                                   

     Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,          
     fearful of what could be waiting outside.                           

     A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.                         

     He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.              

     Silence.                                                            

     His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the        
     sound. The place is empty.                                          

     The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.          

     He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror.      
     His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist         
     portrait.

                              MAN                                          
                  I'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying                   
                  to get away...                                           

     He talks to his own reflection in the mirror-                         

                              MAN (CONT'D)                                 
                  No, please don't...                                      

     He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting        
     against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the          
     dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another          
     extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too        
     frantically-                                                          

     A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.          

     Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-                         

     HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,             
     WATCHING HIM.                                                         

     Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become                
     independent. A separate being...                                      

     Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.         

     The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects      
     the neon lights just like a knife blade.                              

     His eyes turn cold with fear when-                                    

     HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!             

     IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS        
     OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.                                     

     Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his        
     jugular from end to end.                                              

     In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on        
     the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.                     

                                                           CUT TO:

     All the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan-        

     The traffic in the streets, the old turn-of-the-century façades,      
     the people walking on the sidewalk, the pigeons flying away, the      
     Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline reflecting off the
     surface of the Hudson River...

     Seen through the mirrored surfaces, everything in the city seems      
     to move in a distorted way. Ominous.                                  

     The softness of the sun's rising light is contrasted with the         
     eerie, haunting music.

     Bip. Bip. Bip...

     It's 8 a.m. The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock
     reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment.                        

     The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the            
     living room.                                                          

     Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the        
     couch. He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the             
     bathroom.                                                             


3    BATHROOM - CONTINUITY                                             3

     Like a thick fog, the steam from the shower fills the bathroom.
     The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist        
     on the mirror above the sink, revealing-                              

     The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the            
     hardships of life. A life, that from the lines on his face, we        
     suspect hasn't been easy. On his chest and shoulder, SEVERAL          
     BULLET SCARS.                                                         

     Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old
     stubble.


4    BEDROOM - CONTINUITY                                              4

     Ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened             
     bedroom door.                                                         

     Inside, ANGELA is asleep in the bed. She is younger than Ben.         

     ANGELA awakens slowly-                                                

                              ANGELA
                  What time is it?

                              BEN
                  Almost 8:30... Coffee?

                              ANGELA
                  No, you're going to be late.

                              BEN
                  Go back to sleep... I'll call you, OK?

                              ANGELA
                  Yeah, I won't be working until later                    
                  tonight.

     He comes to kiss her on the forehead. She opens a sleepy eye and     
     smiles.

                                ANGELA (CONT'D)                           
                  You shaved?                                             

     She strokes his face gently.                                         

                              ANGELA (CONT'D)
                  I like it. It makes you look younger.                   

     Ben slips on his old military parka before leaving.                  

                                ANGELA (CONT'D)                           
                  Good luck!                                              

                              BEN
                  See you later, Angie.                                   


5    INT. DAY - HALLWAY BUILDING                                     5

     Ben walks down the hallway. The building is old and clearly not      
     well maintained, cracks and graffiti cover the walls.

     The downtown streets are clogged with the early morning rush         
     hour traffic.

     On the honorary board of the NYPD we can read the names of all       
     the officers decorated for their courage. In the reflection of

    Larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files   
    that have been dropped off on his desk-                            

                             LARRY                                     
                 So did you find an apartment yet?

                 I didn't know you had a sister. What

                 I ran into Amy the other day. How are                  
                 things going between the two of you?                   

    Ben remains silent. He obviously doesn't want to get into that

                 the force. Nobody in the squad wants                   
                 you around right now. I'm sorry but I                  
                 have to be honest with you. You

                 got something else for you. I know a                   
                 guy at the Mayflower corporation and

                 know you're over qualified for that

                 money is not that bad.                                 

    Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.

                 You need the money, Ben. You're in the                 
                 middle of a divorce and you've got                     
                 child support to cover. If you want to                 
                 see your kids, you've got to get a                     
                 job, any job.                                          

    Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right.

                Yeah, in a couple months... I gave                       
                everything for the NYPD. I almost died                   
                out there. Everyone seems to have                        
                forgotten that.

10   INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     10

     We discover a whole different world-

     In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's      
     Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand,            
     describe the corpses.                                               

     We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid
     out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached
     a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in
     contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before
     dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the
     woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story...

     Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in
     an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone.                       

     Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates
     for a moment and doesn't answer the call.                           

     Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder.

                  " ...You have reached Amy Carson. I am                 
                  not available to take your call.
                  Please leave a message and I will get
                  back to you as soon as I can."

     Caught in the pouring rain, Ben has taken shelter under the
     scaffolding at a street corner. He plugs his ear with his finger
     to block the traffic and city commotion -

                                BEN
                        (on Amy's voicemail)
                  Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you
                  know that I got a job today... It's                    
                  nothing special, just a security guard                 
                  job... If you still want to go ahead                   
                  with it, we can sign the divorce
                  papers... I mean, if that's what you
                  really want.                                           
                        (he hesitates)
                  I've been thinking about Michael's                     
                  birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if                 
                  we could celebrate it together ... You
                  know, for the kids' sake... Call me...                 
                  Please.                                                

     Ben hangs up the phone. He lingers under the scaffolding for a
     moment, watching the falling rain.


12   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                            12   

     The glass skyscrapers mirror the black clouds in the sky above
     as they slowly break up, giving way to the sun.                     


13   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          13

     On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has
     withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it
     to shut down-

     The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of
     the building-

     The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
     to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows
     are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an
     impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's
     architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic
     streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.

     What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost
     ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.

                                                              9.




14   INT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                          14

     The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes.

     Inside the department store, everything has remained the same
     since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the
     departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt
     or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor
     and rainwater drips down all over the place.

                            MAN (O.S.)                                  
                It's been five years and they're still                  
                in a legal battle with the insurance                    
                companies. Even cleaning up that mess                   
                is impossible...                                        

     In his dark brown uniform, the daytime security guard, LORENZO     
     SAPELLI, 60's, seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once
     a temple of beauty and vanity.

                            LORENZO                                     
                You know, the Meredith family acquired                  
                this building after St. John's                          
                Hospital closed in 1952. It was the                     
                very first Mayflower to open on the                     
                East Coast.                                             

     On the cracked walls, THE HUGE 1920 MIRRORS that have survived     
     the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past. The
     customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying
     in and out of the gaps in the roof.

                            LORENZO (CONT'D)                            
                The company wants us to patrol the                      
                premises every couple of hours, but I
                do my rounds every three hours and
                that's more than enough. Anyway,
                you'll see, there's not much going on.
                It's pretty calm around here.

     Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He         
     listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him
     uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but
     also a sense of death that hangs over it.                          

     The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation      
     system sounds like faraway voices.                                 

     Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd
     floor.

                              LORENZO (CONT'D)
                Here you go... Men's department, or
                what's left of it anyway...

     Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of
     devastation.

                                LORENZO (CONT'D)
                  Thank God you didn't show up any
                  later. This place gives me the chills
                  at night. ... No electricity, and all
                  these mirrors... You know, I live in                    
                  Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood,                    
                  and when someone dies, they cover all                   
                  the mirrors in their house. Some say
                  that it's just to renounce all vanity
                  during the mourning period, but others
                  say something else... They say it's to
                  keep the soul of the dead from being
                  trapped in the mirrors... Believe it                    
                  or not, there's always a bit of truth
                  in any superstition. Am I right?                        

     Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the          
     mirrors that surround him-

                              LORENZO (CONT'D)                            
                  I guess you just have to keep your
                  eyes away from them.

     Unlike the rest of the scenery, THE MIRRORS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAN
     AND GLISTENING.

                              BEN
                  Did you clean them?

                             LORENZO
                  What?

                              BEN
                  The mirrors, why are they so clean?                     

     Lorenzo smiles-

                              LORENZO
                  That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who                       
                  worked here before you. He was
                  completely obsessed with these damn
                  mirrors. He'd spend the entire night
                  polishing them.

                              BEN
                  Why did he leave?

                              LORENZO
                  No idea. Just didn't show up one
                  night. I take it he's found a better                    
                  opportunity somewhere else.

                Why did you resign from the force? You                   
                were a detective, is that correct?

     Lorenzo checks the time on his watch.

                Well, I'll let you get acquainted with

16   INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                              16

     Cartoons flicker on an old television set. All bundled up in a
     coat, and wearing a woolen hat, a young boy is watching TV.
     Lorenzo and Ben enter the mobile home-

                   Lorenzo and I are going to the movies
                   tonight...                                               

     Lorenzo strokes his grandson on the head and proceeds to the
     back of the mobile home, leaving Ben alone with the child. The
     boy looks almost hypnotized by the images on TV.

                               BEN
                   How old are you, Lorenzo?

                               LORENZO JR.
                   8.

     Lorenzo Jr. shifts his attention from the cartoons and stares
     Ben in the face-

                               LORENZO JR. (CONT'D)
                   Do you work in the department store?                     

                               BEN
                   I do now.

                                 LORENZO JR.
                   Grandpa says there are ghosts in the
                   store... Is that true?

     Ben smiles.

                               BEN
                   I think your grandpa just wants to
                   scare you a little.

                                                               13.

     Lorenzo Senior has changed clothes, and returns with a uniform,
     which he hands over to Ben-

                                LORENZO
                  Here, this should fit you. Lorenzo,
                  put your coat on... We are already late.                  
                      (to Ben, on the sly)
                  There's a drop of Jack Daniel's in the                    
                  cupboard... To keep yourself warm.

     Lorenzo hands over the keys-

                              LORENZO (CONT'D)
                  Well, Ben, the place is all yours.

     He's about to leave when-

                                LORENZO (CONT'D)
                  Oh! I forgot the most important                           
                  thing... the flashlights! You'll be                       
                  needing one of these at night. We've
                  got two of them. They run on
                  batteries. Don't forget to charge
                  them... See you in the morning, Ben.

                              BEN
                  See you tomorrow.                                         

     Lorenzo and Lorenzo Jr. exit the trailer. Through the window,
     Ben sees them walk out to the street.

     Ben inspects the trailer- scattered with knickknacks, the
     decoration of the place corresponds well with Lorenzo's
     personality - warmhearted and humble.

     The clock on the wall shows 7 p.m.... A long night lies ahead.

     Ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on. The beam of light is
     dazzling-

                                                             CUT TO:


17   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER - A FEW HOURS LATER                        17

     The flashlight sweeps across the dark entrance hall.

     Wearing the security guard's uniform marked with an embroidered
     "M", Ben makes his first round of the store.

     The pigeons perched on the roof seem to observe him.

     Ben proceeds slowly up the stairs.

                                                                14.




18    - SECOND FLOOR -                                                18

      In the Men's department, Ben's flashlight is a mere luminous
      spot twirling in the night.

      The ever-present mirrors magnify the space to infinity.


19    - THIRD FLOOR -                                                 19

      Ben walks through the different sections of the Ladies'
      department. He examines the remains of the charred garments
      sagging on the hangers.

      The silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of
      the night.

      STRANGE AND DISTURBING SHAPES REFLECT OFF THE MIRRORS.                


19A   EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          19A   

      Wide exterior shot-                                                   

      By night, the department store's ornate facade takes on an            
      entirely different appearance - more menacing, almost evil.           


19B   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          19B   

      Ben continues his rounds.                                             

      We follow his path through reflections in the mirrors-                

      AS IF HE WAS BEING WATCHED...                                         

      Then-                                                                 

      For the first time, we discover another perspective, another POV      
      FROM WITHIN THE MIRRORS. It feels ominous, slightly detached.         
      The sound is muted.                                                   

      Ben crosses back the third floor-                                     

      The second floor...                                                   


20    OMITTED                                                         20

22    OMITTED                                                         22    

                                                                15.




23   - ENTRANCE HALL GROUND FLOOR -                                   23   

     In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance
     hall, we see Ben come down the stairs. He stops for a moment,
     facing his reflection in the mirror.

     He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
     quite an NYPD uniform...

     Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the
     mirror and leans forward-

     A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.

     He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
     off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on
     the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This
     confirms his hunch-

     THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...

     By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.

     Another. And yet another-

     THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD
     OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS
     TO GET OUT...                                                         

     As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO         
     THE BASEMENT OPENING...                                               

     Ben turns around. His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE            
     BASEMENT IS CLOSED!                                                   

     YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN!              

     Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in          
     reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is      
     he dreaming or hallucinating?                                         

     Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes       
     fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees      
     his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!          

     Ben opens it-                                                         

     THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED        
     IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED. Ben tries to reenact the             
     phenomenon. He opens and closes the door over and over, while         
     observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful.      

     The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark.         
     Ben hesitates.                                                        

                                                                16.

36    INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER - CONTINUITY           36    

      Ben walks down the stairs, step-by-step, lighting his way with a
      flashlight. The beam of light dims, the battery is almost dead.
      He gives it a few taps to make the light reappear.

      Last step-

      HIS FOOT LANDS IN WATER!

                             BEN
                   Fuck...                                                  

      A few inches of water cover the basement floor. One of the water
      pipes must have burst due to the cold.

                                                                17.

     The light flickers back for a moment, revealing before him-        the
     narrow subterranean corridors of the department store.                   

     Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the                
     switches. Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent          
     lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the                 
     darkness.

     AS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY,         
     UP ALONG THE STAIRS, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR, IT ACCELERATES AND           
     STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR-

     IN THE REFLECTION, WE SEE THE BASEMENT DOOR SHUT...

                                                        FADE TO BLACK


37   EXT. DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET                                       37

     It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines
     the trees and houses.

     On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year
     old DAISY are building a snowman.

                              MICHAEL
                  Why did they say on TV that it wasn't
                  supposed to snow today, but tomorrow
                  instead? Why did they lie?

                                DAISY
                  Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael.
                  It happens...

                              MICHAEL
                  Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only
                  little children do.

     Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman.

     Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight
     of her father's car approaching-                                         

                             DAISY
                  Daddy!

     Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile,           
     with a big wrapped package in his arms.

     The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their
     father. Ben takes Michael into his arms-

                              MICHAEL
                      (pointing to the wrapped
                       present)
                  What is that?

                              BEN
                  Well I don't know, I just found this
                  package hidden behind a tree.

                              MICHAEL
                  Is it for me?

                              BEN
                  Maybe...
                      (to his daughter)
                  Daisy, has Michael been a good boy?
                  Does he deserve his birthday present?

     Michael nods.

                              DAISY
                  No! Yesterday he finished the whole
                  bag of candy when mom had told him he
                  could only have one piece.

                                MICHAEL
                  Not true!

                              DAISY
                  Yes it's true!

                              MICHAEL
                  No, it's not true... She's lying Daddy.
                  I've been a very good boy, I promise.

     They enter the house.

                              BEN
                  Is mom back?

                              DAISY
                  Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from
                  school today.                                           


38   INT. DAY - HOUSE - CONTINUITY                                  38

     In the kitchen, ROSA, the nanny, is rinsing the dishes from the      
     afternoon snack-

                                BEN
                  Hello Rosa!

                              ROSA

                  I'm good, very good... What time will
                  Amy be back?

                  Not before six, Sir...

                              BEN
                  OK, I'll wait for her.

                              ROSA
                  Do you want me to fix you a snack?

                              BEN
                  No, thank you. I'll be fine.

     Ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room. He
     hands over the present to his son.

     Daisy is sitting in the armchair, holding her cat, TIGER, in her
     arms.

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  Happy birthday, Michael.

                                MICHAEL
                  What is it?

                              DAISY
                  Duh, open it stupid!

     Michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote
     control car. The little boy is on cloud nine.


39   - LATER IN THE AFTERNOON -                                     39

     Through the front window, we see a Volvo station wagon park in
     front of the house. Amy gets out of the car, loaded with
     shopping bags. She enters the house and hands the groceries over
     to Rosa.

                                AMY
                  Hi Rosa... Where are the kids?                         

                              ROSA
                  Upstairs...                                            
                      (in a low voice)
                  ...With Señor Ben.                                     

     The expression on Amy's face shifts. Noticeably irritated, she      
     goes up to the second floor.                                        

     Michael's remote control car drives at full speed down the          
     hallway. Ben shows his children how to operate the remote           
     control while the bathtub fills up. He seems as excited as the      
     kids by the new toy.                                                

     Ben turns around to find Amy watching them.

                  Look Mommy, look what Daddy got me.

                  It's great, you will have to show me                   
                  how it works!

                  Ben, can I talk to you, in private?                    

     Ben puts down the remote control-                                   

                              BEN
                      (to his kids)
                  Ok kids, it's time for your bath. No                   
                  fooling around.

     Ben follows Amy into the bedroom. She closes the door behind        
     them.


40   INT. EARLY EVENING- BEDROOM HOUSE                              40

     Amy is not equally pleased to see him- She's beside herself with    
     anger-

                              AMY
                  What is this? I already asked you not
                  to drop by without calling, didn't I?

                              BEN
                  I do, but you never take my calls!

                              AMY
                  I don't need your calls in the middle                  
                  of the night. I'm better off without
                  them.

                              BEN
                  I haven't had a drink in three months                  
                  but, then again, how would you know?

                              AMY
                  I don't want to know, Ben. I don't
                  want to hear about it. It's not my
                  problem. You're not my problem. You've                 
                  done more than enough harm already.

                              BEN
                  You don't think people can change?

                              AMY
                  We are not talking about people, we're
                  talking about you. How many times did
                  you tell me you were gonna change and
                  nothing happened? It only got worse.

     Ben moves closer to his ex-wife-                                      

                              BEN
                  Just give me another chance.                             

     She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him?          
     Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys, we sense Amy       
     is torn. She still loves him as well.                                 

                              AMY
                  I need more time, Ben. Listen, I will                    
                  never stop you from seeing your                          
                  children but we have to set up some                      
                  rules.                                                   

     Out of nowhere, Ben hits the wall with his bare fist-                 

                              BEN
                  WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING                       
                  BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE                   
                  IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?                     


41   INT. EARLY EVENING - HOUSE BATHROOM                             41

     In the bathtub, Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their
     parents arguing. In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his          
     hands and lies back under the water...                                


42   BACK IN THE BEDROOM -                                           42    

     Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the        
     edge. We can see the anger in his eyes...                             

                              AMY                                          
                  Look at yourself. You're still                           
                  carrying around so much of that anger.                   

     He catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror- and of the      
     desperate violence in his eyes... Ben steps back.                     

                              BEN                                          
                      (trying to calm down)                                
                  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at                      
                  you... Things could be so different                      
                  between us.                                              

                              AMY                                          
                  Yes I know, but it's up to you Ben.

                  Yeah... Anyway, I wasn't planning on                   
                  staying. My shift starts in an hour.                   
                  I'll just kiss them goodbye and then                   
                  I'm leaving.                                           

     Ben exits the room. Amy is left alone-                              

     Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into     
     his car.

     When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing       
     outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. She smiles,       
     and quickly comes to dry them.                                      

                                MICHAEL

                  Is Daddy coming back to live with us?                  

     She smiles gently.                                                  

                              AMY
                  I don't know sweetheart. I don't know.                 


43   INT. DAY - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER                        43    

     The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of
     water flooding the basement corridor. Since yesterday, the water    
     level has continued to rise.

     The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the
     staircase leading to the ground floor-

                              BEN
                  I haven't managed to find the source
                  of the leak. My guess is it doesn't
                  come from the store... It must be a
                  municipal pipe that blew with the
                  cold...

                              LORENZO
                  I'll call the company tomorrow morning                 
                  and have them come take a look at it.


44   INT. NIGHT- SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                            44

     On the gas stove, a kettle is whistling.

     Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers. He finds
     some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He
     briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky...              

     He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant
     coffee.                                                             

     In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is
     past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time      
     for his rounds.


45   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL                            45

     Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben
     walking through the store.

     Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his
     attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking
     into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural
     manifestation.

     The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are
     all disturbing and unsettling.

     Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble        
     columns seems alive in the dark.                                    

     As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his
     attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-

     AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL
     SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE
     FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING
     HAPPENED.

     How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in
     the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...                               

     Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-

     The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben
     decides to check it out for himself...

     Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of
     dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER
     HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"-

     We follow him in the mirror-

     Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime"
     department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.

     Ben continues his journey into the past.

     The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big
     sale. Children run wild in the aisles. Women fight over articles
     of clothing.                                                          

     Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes,
     a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-

     He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE.
     Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor
     of the department store.

     Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A
     ZIPPO-

     The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion.

     The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A
     DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-

     EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS
     AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN
     AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.

     Frightened, Ben steps back-

     The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has       
     rushed to escape death-                                               

     HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH.
     FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE.                

     In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the      
     face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?                               

     Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches
     fire.

     Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-

                                                            CUT TO:

     IN THE DARK NIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE CHARRED RUINS, BEN QUIVERS
     DELIRIOUSLY AS HE TRIES TO SMOTHER THE INVISIBLE FLAMES.

     He comes back to reality-

     Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's
     happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.

     During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the
     counters.

     Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground
     and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER
     WALLET.



                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                                 25.

      He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out
      but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed
      there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced
      touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.

      Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a
      driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a
      sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN              
      RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY, AT THE BEGINNING. The name rings a bell         
      for him-                                                               


46    INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                              46

      Ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet-

      He stops when he finds another uniform. A name is embroidered on
      the shoulder-

      AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING
      NIGHT WATCHMAN.

      The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He
      cannot hold back his police instincts.

      He finally empties out the contents on the table-

      A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license,
      Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of
      paper folded in four-

      Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink-

      ESSEKER                                                                

      Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A           
      place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts                 
      everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one       
      of the drawers.                                                        

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

48A   EXT. DAY - QUEENS STREET                                         48A

      A busy street under the subway overpass. We see a neighborhood         
      bar on the corner-


49    INT. DAY -QUEENS BAR                                             49

      At this time of day the place is deserted. A plasma screen shows       
      a baseball game. A drunk guy is half asleep at the corner table.       


                                                           (CONTINUED)

     Sitting at the bar, Ben is nervous, tense... He removes the         
     steeped tea bag from his cup.                                       

     Ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display
     shelves. It is not his mirror image that he is observing. His
     gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection, to dive beyond,
     into the very depths of his soul.                                   

     Angela interrupts, across from him, behind the bar. She works
     here.

                              ANGELA
                      (intrigued)
                  What are you looking at?                               

                              BEN
                  Nothing special...

                      (playfully)
                  Come on, you've been looking at                        
                  yourself for more than half an hour.                   
                  You never used to be so vain.                          

                                BEN
                  You can't avoid them. They're
                  everywhere...

                              ANGELA
                  What are you talking about?

                              BEN
                  The mirrors... In the department

                  windows of every fucking building in                   
                  this city. I feel like I'm not the one                 
                  looking into the mirrors, but rather                   
                  they're looking at me.                                 

     Angela smiles, not sure if he is serious-                           

                              ANGELA
                  You need a drink.

                  No, I'm serious.                                       

                              ANGELA

                  bit paranoid?                                          

     Ben observes the palm of his hand.                                  

                              ANGELA (CONT'D)

     Angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking           
     glasses.                                                            


50   INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER                               50    

     In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface.

     In the basement, the water level continues to rise.

     With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,
     Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.

     He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light
     sweeps across the walls and the piping.

     Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,
     he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
     dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
     off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF        
     PSYCHIATRY.                                                         

     He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.

     Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer
     and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The
     humidity has pearled into droplets.

     He has found the source of the leak.

     His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben
     digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked
     water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which
     the tubing was embedded.

     Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were
     another room on the other side of the wall.

     He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it
     with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the
     gaping black hole that he has just left behind.

     Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot
     make out what is on the other side.

     He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for
     him to crawl through-

     ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE       
     MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY    
     WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS           
     MIRRORS.

     One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door.                    

     He enters.

     His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite
     angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room-

     ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING        
     IN THE CORNER.                                                         

     It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security
     guard's uniform.

     From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's
     head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name
     embroidered on the man's shoulder-

     IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN!

                               BEN
                  Gary?

     The silhouette remains still.

                               BEN (CONT'D)
                  Gary?

     Ben comes a bit closer.

     His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in
     front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but-

     HE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR, INSIDE!

     Ben steps back, terrified.

     He doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon.

     Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror-

     Knock, knock, knock...

     He hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass
     window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side-

     No reaction. Ben strikes the mirror harder.

     Knock, knock, knock...

     The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben,
     revealing his face little by little...

                                                             CUT TO:

     In his bed, Ben wakes up with a jolt- THE ENCOUNTER WITH GARY
     WAS A DREAM.

     Knock, knock, knock...

     Somebody is knocking at his door. Ben gets up from the couch-       

                              BEN
                  Coming...

     Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package-

                              DELIVERYMAN
                  Mr. Carson?                                            
                      (Ben nods)
                  Would you mind signing here, please?

     Ben signs for it and takes the package.

                              DELIVERYMAN (CONT'D)
                  You have a nice day, Sir...

     Ben shuts the door and examines the UPS box. He's not used to
     getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from-

     THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS...

     Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the
     cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room
     table-

     A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE.

     More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department
     store and the fire that burned it down... Gary has meticulously
     cut them out and sent them to Ben. But why?                         


52   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                           52

     Ben's car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance
     to Mayflower.

     He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer, ready to go home
     from work-

                                LORENZO
                  I've just been through the craziest

                  never liked him too much, but poor
                  guy, he didn't deserve to go like

                  No... they wouldn't tell me.

     Lorenzo hands him over the keys.

                  Well, Ben? I better get going, Mrs.
                  Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
                  Have a good night at work, Ben. Oh,                      
                  and by the way, about that leak,
                  they're sending someone over to work

                  Have a good night, Lorenzo.

     Ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment,
     his gaze fixed at the department store-

     THE WALLET, THE DREAM, AND NOW, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, THE NEWS
     OF GARY'S DEATH... ALL THESE STRANGE COINCIDENCES AROUND HIS
     PREDECESSOR HAVE AWOKEN HIS CURIOSITY AND DOUBT. BEN WANTS TO

     the basement door.

     He goes down-


54   INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER                                 54

     Ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight, and
     follows the subterranean passageway.


                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                                31.

     Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of déjà-vu, HE IS
     IN THE VERY ACT OF RELIVING HIS NIGHTMARE IN DETAIL, STEP BY
     STEP-

     In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface.

     He crosses an intersection and, once again-

     He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on         
     the tiled wall.

     The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the
     piping, bringing to light, in the distance-

     THE BROWNISH DAMP-SPOT.

                                BEN
                      (to himself)
                  Damn... What is happening to me?

     The moisture has pearled into droplets. Slowly, his hand comes
     closer. The wall crumbles at the slightest touch...

     Pushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster,
     just as he had done in his nightmare...

     He hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the
     other side of the wall. It confirms the existence of a hidden
     room.

     Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a
     large enough opening to access the other side-

     He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing-

     THE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM, SURROUNDED       
     BY THE MIRRORING WALLS.

     He enters. His image is reflected in all directions and
     multiplied into infinity. His dream was foreboding. Everything        
     is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of
     Gary Lewis-

     The former watchman is not there but...                               

     ALL OF A SUDDEN, BEHIND HIM, ONE OF BEN'S DUPLICATES IN THE           
     INFINITE REFLECTION TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE HIM WITH AN ICE COLD      
     GLARE...                                                              

     Sensing something wrong, Ben turns around.                            

     In the silence he faces his infinite reflections, all of them         
     identical- OR ALMOST...                                               

     Taking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates' faces         
     bearing an expression slightly different from the others'. A          
     SUBTLE GRIN.                                                          


                                                          (CONTINUED)

54    CONTINUED: (2)                                                 54


      Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the "rebel duplicate"      
      turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze-           

      We can hardly recognize Ben's image.                                

      The duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other       
      reflections and slowly walks towards Ben.                           

      Instinctively, Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the        
      vision disappear.                                                   

      When he opens up his eyes again-                                    

      HIS EVIL DOUBLE RUSHES TOWARDS HIM-                                 

      Ben steps back terrified.                                           



                                                           CUT TO:


55    INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     55

      Under the dazzling neon light of the NYPD coroner's premises,
      Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to
      the police inspectors in charge of the investigation.

      She is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is
      someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her
      urgently. Amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves,      
      and exits the autopsy room.

      We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police
      uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and
      goings between the police station and the hospital.                 

      The atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive     
      activity of this particular department. There is no doubt- we
      are in New York City.                                               


55A   CORONER'S OFFICE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                           55A   

      Amy comes to the reception desk. Ben, who clearly hasn't slept      
      since the night before, is pacing back and forth.

                             AMY                                          
                 Are you OK? What's happening? What are                   
                 you doing here?                                          

                             BEN
                 Amy, I need you to do me a favor...

                               AMY
                   Listen, I am in the middle of work, I
                   don't really have time now.                              

                               BEN
                   I need your help... It won't take more
                   than twenty minutes. Please, Amy?

      From his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license. He shows
      it to her-

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                   You picked up this guy yesterday
                   morning... I need to take a look at him.
                   It's very important.

                               AMY
                   Why do you want to see him?

                               BEN
                   He used to work at the Mayflower as a                    
                   night watchman, before I replaced him.

                               AMY
                   Where did you get his driver's
                   license?

                               BEN
                   I found his wallet in the department
                   store. I need to find out how he
                   died...

                               AMY
                   You are no longer a cop, Ben. This
                   isn't your business anymore.

                                 BEN
                   He sent me a package before he died,
                   with newspaper articles about the
                   Mayflower... I think he was trying to
                   tell me something... I don't know him.
                   I've never even met him, Amy... I need
                   to figure this out.


56    INT. DAY - MORGUE                                              56

      The refrigerated compartment bays, containing the corpses, are
      aligned along the basement walls.

      A young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the
      morgue. As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register,
      in search of a name.

                  Gary Lewis... Gary Lewis... Oh, there he
                  is, 58B... He slashed his throat...                      

                              AMY
                      (to Ben)
                  There you go... There's your answer.
                  Your man committed suicide.

                              BEN                                          
                  You know a lot of people who cut their
                  own throats?                                             

                              YOUNG DOCTOR

                  Well, all I know is that the cops are                    
                  still investigating this one. That's                     
                  why we still have the body. People can                   
                  be very creative when it comes to                        
                  suicide. I'm sure it's not the                           
                  craziest thing you've seen.                              

     The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the
     door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray
     carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet-

                                  YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                  Gary Lewis...

     He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body-

     Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His       
     skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse
     is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His         
     flesh has started to decompose and putrefy.

     Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful
     information...

     Amy becomes impatient.

                              AMY
                  I've got to get back to work, Ben.
                  They're waiting for me upstairs.

                                BEN
                  How... What did he slit his throat with?                 

     The doctor checks the report.

                                YOUNG DOCTOR
                  With... with a piece of mirror.

     Ben looks up.

     The doctor, has a smirk on his face-

                              YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                ...Seven years of bad luck.

     Suddenly, reflected in the stainless-steel door of the
     compartment bay, Ben sees-

     GARY'S FACE TURN SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM. GARY STARES DIRECTLY AT
     HIM. WITH A VOICE FROM BEYOND, HE DELIVERS A MESSAGE TO BEN-

                                GARY
                ...ESSSEKERRR...

     Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. Neither Amy
     nor the doctor saw anything, of course. They gaze at him with a
     puzzled look-

                            AMY
                Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?

     Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen
     in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened.

                            BEN
                    (coming to his senses)
                I need to see his files...

                              AMY
                What?

     Ben raises his voice.

                            BEN
                I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES!

                              AMY
                Come on, Ben, what is it you're after?
                I am not supposed to show you any
                file... You're not even allowed to be
                here. I could get fired for this.                        

     The doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more
     personal turn.

                            YOUNG DOCTOR
                Well, I'll be off. Amy, you know where
                to find me if you need me.

     Amy is left alone with Ben.

     On the shelves, photographs of Michael and Daisy stand next to
     the medical records and legal-medicine textbooks.

     Sitting behind Amy's desk, Ben is studying Gary Lewis' file. He
     flips back and forth through the different documents,
     photographs, and police reports.

     Amy observes him, perplexed. We sense that she is concerned         
     about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.                  

                            BEN
                Look at this picture... Come and see,
                Amy.

     He shows her a snapshot taken by the police. We see Gary soaked
     in his own blood, the throat slit open. The picture is real,        
     crude. He lies outstretched, facing a mirror shattered into         
     several pointy pieces, like a spider web. In his hand, Gary
     still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself.         

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                Look...

                              AMY
                What!?

     Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-

                            BEN
                Look at the piece of mirror in his
                hand. In the reflection of the mirror                    
                it's covered in blood, and look- in                      
                reality, it's clean. Not a drop of
                blood...

                              AMY
                So what?

                            BEN
                Don't you find it strange that this                      
                mirror doesn't reflect an exact image
                of reality?

                  I can't see the difference. It must be
                  an effect of the angle from which the
                  photograph was taken. What is it you
                  are you trying to prove?

                              BEN
                  What if the mirrors were showing us
                  something different?

                              AMY
                  What? For Christ's sake, listen to
                  yourself, Ben! What are you talking
                  about?

                              BEN
                  What if the mirrors were reflecting
                  something that goes beyond reality?

                                AMY
                        (irritated)
                  OK... This is way over my head. I don't
                  have time for your barfly theories.                      

     Ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her. Not
     today.

                              BEN
                  Thanks for your help...

     He's on his way out, when she holds him back-

                              AMY
                  You should go home and get some rest.                    
                  This guy probably just killed himself
                  because he couldn't live with himself

58   INT. DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - BATHROOM                           58   

     The steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet.           

     Ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower.

     He watches his blurry reflection. With his finger, on the
     surface of the fogged mirror, he writes-

     ESSEKER

     He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying
     to interpret their meaning.

     In the end, he wipes off the mirror with his hand, erasing the
     word.

     Angela is standing behind him in the door opening-                  

                                ANGELA

                  Ben?

                  I'm your sister, you can talk to me.                   
                  Is it your new job? That place, the                    
                  Mayflower, has bad vibes. It's getting                 
                  under your skin. Just think about what                 
                  I told you...

                              BEN

                  You won't have any trouble finding
                  another one. A daytime job, a regular

     While she's talking, we see the scene from another point of view- 
     from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO       
     THEM.                                                             

     Angela leaves the bathroom. Ben brushes his teeth. He leans over
     to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up-

     IT IS NOT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, BUT GARY LEWIS       
     WHO SLASHES HIS THROAT FROM END TO END WITH A SHARP PIECE OF        
     MIRROR-                                                             

     Ben steps back and loses his balance, knocking down a shelf.
     Angela rushes into the bathroom-                                    

                              ANGELA (CONT'D)                            
                  What happened Ben? Are you all right?

     He refuses her help.                                                

                              BEN
                  LEAVE ME ALONE...                                      

     Ben gets to his feet and looks into the mirror. His reflection
     is back. Everything looks normal but-

59   EXT. DAY- GARY LEWIS' BUILDING                                 59

     The sun sets behind the Harlem skyline.

     Ben's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to
     pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift.

     He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady
     answers-

                              BEN
                Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My
                name is Ben Carson. I worked with                        
                Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up
                and talk to you for a few minutes?

     Silence.

                            BEN (CONT'D)
                Mrs. Lewis ?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                ...5th floor, apartment 3B...

     The entrance door of the building opens.

60   INT. DAY- MRS. LEWIS' APARTMENT                                60

     MRS. LEWIS is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her
     thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she
     used to share with her grandson.

     We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death.

                              MRS. LEWIS
                ...My Gary hadn't slept at home for
                three weeks. At first I figured he had
                found himself a girlfriend, so I
                didn't worry much about it... It's
                terrible. The policeman told me that
                he was living in the streets... They                     
                found his body in the subway. Why? He
                had everything he needed here. Every
                morning I would have his breakfast
                ready when he'd come home from work.

                  Did he use any drugs?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Gary? Huh-huh! Never... He was a good
                  boy.

                              BEN
                  Did you notice anything different, the
                  days prior to his leaving the house,
                  anything unusual in his behavior?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Oh yes, but that goes way back to when
                  he started working at Mayflower.

                              BEN
                  What kind of changes?

                                MRS. LEWIS
                  He didn't care much for anything
                  anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch
                  television together. But once he
                  started that job as a night watchman,
                  he'd spend all his time-off locked up
                  in his room...

                              BEN
                  Sleeping?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  He hardly slept anymore... He was way
                  too busy!

                              BEN
                  Busy doing what?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  That, I don't know... I never knew what
                  he was up to...

     She reaches for a picture frame on the chest.

                              MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                  Look, in this picture he was twelve
                  years old...

                              BEN
                  Is that you standing next to him?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Yes, back in the days...

                              BEN
                  Mrs. Lewis, I found a note that Gary

                A piece of paper, where he'd scribbled
                down the name, Esseker... Does that mean
                anything to you?                                         

                            MRS. LEWIS
                Esseker, is that what you're saying?

     The old lady dwells on it for a moment-

                            MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                No, that don't mean a thing to me...

     She sets down the picture frame.                                    

                            BEN
                May I see his room?

                            MRS. LEWIS
                Yes, of course. Come, follow me, it's
                down the hallway, the door at the very
                end.

     Ben follows Mrs. Lewis to her grandson's room-

     It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but
     rather like that of an old teenager. From what we can see, Gary
     grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life.
     Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly
     tidy.

                            BEN
                Do you mind if I stay in here for a
                moment?

     Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts
     in Gary's room.

     Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might
     help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks
     through the papers-

     Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he
     hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors
     seem to invite him to enter...

     What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have
     imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and
     MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THE
     CEILING! - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben
     discovered back in the basement of the department store...

                            MRS. LEWIS
                He would spend hours looking at
                himself...

     Mrs. Lewis steps up behind him-

                 To look at oneself too much is a sin.
                 A terrible sin. Do you know sir in the
                 Garden of Eden in order to seduce Eve,
                 Satan did not keep the appearance of a
                 snake... Satan reproduced the young
                 woman's traits in such a way that Eve
                 would only see and listen to the image
                 of herself... As in a mirror.


61    INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                        61

      Night has fallen. The department store is calm and silent.

      We move down each floor to the entrance hall. The basement door
      is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the
      flashlight. Ben must be down there.

      ALL OF A SUDDEN, A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE. There
      is a woman, somewhere in the store.

      Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. The shrieks
      resound through the department store again. They seem to come
      from one of the floors above.

      Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-

      He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the
      departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.

      He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight
      sweeps past each nook and dark corner-

      Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail
      to death.

                             BEN
                     (shouting)
                 WHERE ARE YOU?!!

      No answer. Ben goes up to the fourth floor. The shrieks are
      heard again, but this time, coming from one of the floors below.
      Ben dashes for the Ladies' department-

                 STAY CALM... I'M COMING!                                 


61A   INT. NIGHT - LADIES' DEPARTMENT DRESSING ROOMS                61A   

      The screams come closer. Ben passes the counters and enters the
      dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire.

      The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere.



                                                           (CONTINUED)

                               BEN                                         
                   I'm here Ma'am...

      Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his
      flashlight.

      The woman seems to have vanished.

                               BEN (CONT'D)
                   Ma'am? I'm right he...

      ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around-

      No one there.

      About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a
      mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-

      A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY
      ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!

      Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE
      MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!

      Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
      face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened
      inside.

      Ben unhooks the mirror.

      It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down
      the wall.

      Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.

      He reaches the last dressing room-

      Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior
      of the cubicle.

      In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE
      TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of
      the body...

      With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards
      the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover.
      He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing-

      A NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH
      PAIN. DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REAL FLAMES, HER SKIN AND FLESH ARE
      ROASTING, AS IF SHE WERE BURNING ALIVE FROM THE INSIDE OUT!

62    INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                  62

      We are in the darkness of Daisy and Michael's bedroom. Michael
      is terrified and cries out for his mother-

                              MICHAEL
                 Mom! Mom!

      Amy swings the door open and turns on the light.

                             AMY
                 What is it Michael?

      The little boy throws himself into his mother's arms. Daisy
      wakes up.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 What is it? Did you have a bad dream?

                             MICHAEL
                 There's a lady screaming...

                             AMY
                 Where Michael?

      Michael points to the mirror wall facing the bunk beds.            

                               MICHAEL
                 There... In the mirror...

                               AMY
                 No, Michael... Look, there's nothing
                 there.

                             MICHAEL
                 I saw her mom. I swear I did.

                             AMY
                 It was just a nightmare. It's late,
                 you have to go back to sleep. I'll
                 turn on the night-light, if you want.

      Amy tucks him into bed and kisses him. Before leaving the room
      she plugs in the night-light.

                             DAISY
                 Mom, can you leave the door open?

                             AMY
                 Sure sweetheart... OK, you two go to
                 sleep now.

     Amy leaves the room.

     In his bed, Michael cannot stop himself from staring at the
     dimly lit mirror.


63   INT. NIGHT - AMY'S BEDROOM                                     63

     Amy goes back to her room. The local news play on the TV. She
     gets into bed and turns off the light. She reaches for the
     remote and clicks the TV off, turning over-

     THE NAKED BURNED WOMAN FROM THE STORE STANDS STILL IN THE
     REFLECTION OF THE TV SET.

     The entity watches Amy while she is sleeping.

     Once again, the POV from behind the mirror. OMINOUS, SLIGHTLY
     DETACHED AND MUTED.

                                                                 CUT TO:


64   EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                         64

     Ben secures the padlock of the department store entrance.

     He walks towards the trailer, while keeping a fixed eye on the
     facade of the building. The scene he just witnessed in the
     dressing rooms has shaken him up.

     He goes inside. Through one of the windows we see him pick up
     the phone and dial a number-


65   INT. NIGHT - APARTMENT QUEENS / INTERCUT INT. NIGHT - LODGE    65     

     Angela is in the bathroom when the phone starts ringing. She
     turns on the tap of the cast-iron bathtub and goes to answer.

                                  ANGELA
                  Hello... Ben?

                              BEN (O.S.)
                  Sorry I'm calling you this late. Were
                  you sleeping?

                              ANGELA
                  No, no, I just got home from work.
                  What's wrong? You sound strange.                         

     On the phone, Ben struggles to put his feelings into words-           

                              BEN(O.S.)
                  Don't worry, everything's OK.

                              BEN (O.S.)                                 
                  Actually, no. I think maybe I'm losing                 
                  my mind.

                              ANGELA                                     
                  What happened?

                  That's the smart thing to do, Ben. You
                  deserve better than that. You should
                  come back here and get some sleep.                     

                              BEN (O.S.)
                  No, I'll wait till the daytime guy                     
                  gets here to tell him.

                              ANGELA
                  Are you sure?

                              BEN (O.S.)
                  Yeah, sure. See you later, Angie.

                                ANGELA
                  Be careful... Love you.

                  Love you too, sis.                                     

     She hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment,
     concerned.

     The sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality.

     We follow her into the bathroom. She dips her fingers into the
     water to check the temperature. The bathtub is almost full.

     Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror. When
     she turns around to climb into the hot bath, HER REFLECTION
     REMAINS MOTIONLESS IN THE MIRROR, STARING BLANKLY AT EACH OF HER
     MOVEMENTS.

     Unaware, Angela soaks into her hot bath.

     The water continues to pour from the tap.

     Angela shuts her eyes- It's been a long day.

     IN THE MIRROR, ANGELA'S REFLECTION FIXES HER WITH A COLD GLARE-



                                                           (CONTINUED)

     Without a word, Angela's reflection brings its hands to its face
     and digs its fingers into its mouth. In a sudden jerk, it pulls
     open its jaw-

     AS IF SHE WERE ELECTROCUTED, ANGELA'S BODY CONTORTS VIOLENTLY
     FORWARD. HER MOUTH IS DEFORMED, AS IF AN INVISIBLE FORCE WERE
     WRENCHING IT WIDE OPEN.

     IN THE MIRROR, HER EVIL DOUBLE CONTINUES TO PULL OPEN ITS MOUTH,
     SUDDENLY RIPPING ITS JAW OFF WITH THE SOUND OF CRACKING BONES
     AND CARTILAGE-

     AT THE SAME INSTANT, IN THE BATHTUB, ANGELA HAS NO TIME TO REACT
     BEFORE SHE UNDERGOES THE SAME AGONIZING TORTURE!                        

     The mirror cracks by itself.                                            

     The bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white
     tiled bathroom floor.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK


66   INT. DAY -   APARTMENT QUEENS - THE NEXT MORNING                   66   

     The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene.

     Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is
     entirely flooded.

     Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep
     the intrusive neighbors away.

     A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the
     downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police,
     after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains
     how "it was raining blood into her living room"...

     Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find
     Larry. He is in charge of the case.                                     

     Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of           
     the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black
     hair, floating in the murky water.

     Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and            
     sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the          
     chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub.

     The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's
     naked corpse.

     With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of        
     hair covering Angela's face-




                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                               48.
66   CONTINUED:                                                      66


     Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of          
     this JAW-LESS FACE.

     Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts         
     to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention-       

     He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet              
     mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks.       

     Strange.

     A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns        
     immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's       
     destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub.

     A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him-                 

                              POLICE INSPECTOR O.S.
                  Larry? Take a look at this...                             

                                LARRY                                       
                  What is it?

                              POLICE INSPECTOR O.S.
                  Come take a look for yourself.                            

     Larry exits the bathroom. The police inspector in the living           
     room holds a picture frame in his hands. He turns towards Larry-       

                                POLICE INSPECTOR
                  Look... Isn't Ben Carson in the picture?

67   INT. DAY - POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM                    67

     Still wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the
     interrogation rooms of the police station. His haggard face
     expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him                 
     distraught.

     He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands.

     The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his
     reflection.

     Ben knows that he is being watched.

     Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him. Larry is standing         
     next to her.

                              LARRY                                         
                  The water has obliterated most of the                     
                  marks. No trace of struggle or broken                     
                  entry, the entrance door was locked.

                              LARRY                                       
                  Listen, so far, his statement is                        
                  pretty consistent with the facts... We
                  checked it out, he did place a call
                  from work at 12:30, and the woman's                     
                  downstairs neighbors claim they
                  started noticing the water leakage at
                  around two in the morning. The daytime
                  security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli,
                  confirms he came on after Ben's shift
                  at seven a.m. The only strange thing,
                  and it may just be a coincidence, is
                  that Ben told Sappeli that he had
                  decided to quit his job, as if he was
                  planning to go away somewhere... Did he
                  mention anything about it to you?

                              AMY
                  No, lately, communication hasn't quite
                  been our strong point...
                      (she smiles)
                  I only found out yesterday that he was                  
                  staying at his sister's. What are you                   
                  going to do with him?                                   

                              LARRY                                       
                  I figure we'll let him go. At this                      
                  point we haven't got any real reason                    
                  to keep him here. And, I think he's                     
                  had his share for the day.                              

                              AMY                                         
                  You know what's gonna happen if you                     
                  let him go. He won't stop here. I know                  
                  him, he won't stop until he finds who                   
                  did this to her.                                        

                              LARRY                                       
                  Listen, where we stand now, we got                      
                  nothing, not a single clue. I'm sure                    
                  he can help us.

                  What kind of friend are you? You are                    
                  using him. He's not a cop anymore.

     Amy comes closer to the two-way mirror. She looks at her ex-           
     husband on the other side. He seems overcome with grief and            
     confusion. She can see the distress in his eyes.

68   EXT. DAY - POLICE STATION                                         68

     Ben has been released.

     Under the pouring rain, on the front steps of the police
     station, Amy tries to reason with him-

                            AMY
                You have to see someone Ben. You                            
                cannot stay in this situation any
                longer. You need help, psychological
                support.

     Ben is not listening. His mind is elsewhere.

                            AMY (CONT'D)
                Why don't you...if you want...come spend a                  
                few days at home, with the kids?

                            BEN
                No, I don't want to put them in any
                danger.

                            AMY
                What do you mean?                                           

                            BEN                                             
                I've got things I need to deal with.

                            AMY
                Ben, look at me! I don't want you to
                get into any trouble. Think about
                Daisy and Michael. You are not going
                to solve this case. Please, stay out                        
                of it.

                            BEN

                   I know who did this Amy.                                 

                               AMY
                   In that case, you have to tell them                      
                   everything.

                                 BEN
                   They wouldn't believe me and neither
                   would you... Goodbye.                                    

      Ben walks away, leaving Amy alone on the steps of the police
      station

                                  AMY
                   Ben, wait...

      Ben does not turn around. The rain is beating down harder and
      the thunder grumbles in the distance. The first lightning             
      flashes light up the sky.                                             

      Another flash-


68A   - QUEENS APARTMENT -                                            68A   

      Ben ignores the crime scene's restriction perimeter and enters        
      Angela's apartment. Without turning on the light, he goes             
      straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes.       

      Inside- A .357 MAGNUM, his former cop weapon.                         

      Another flash-                                                        


69    EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          69    

      The lightning bolts illuminate the facade of the department
      store.

      Ben's car is parked in front of the construction fence.


70    INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          70

      The rainwater pours through the openings in the roof,
      penetrating the interior of the deserted department store. It
      dribbles down the cracked walls and over the half-burnt
      mannequins...


71    INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER BASEMENT- MIRROR ROOM                    71

      We hear the echo of the roaring thunder outside, but in the
      gloom of the flooded basement, there is another blaring sound-



                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                             52.
71   CONTINUED:                                                     71


     A DULL METALLIC THUD. It gets louder and louder, closer and
     closer as we advance towards the opening to the mirror room-

     Inside, we find Ben, out of his mind, throwing a chair against      
     the mirrors with all his strength, in an attempt to demolish
     them-                                                               

     He's exhausted and he's forced to stop.

     Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors
     seem completely indestructible...

     Ben is not through with them. He drops the chair to the ground
     and pulls out the gun from his belt.                                

     Without a moment's hesitation he opens fire-

     THE MIRRORS SHATTER VIOLENTLY, CRACKING WITH THE POWERFUL IMPACT    
     OF THE BULLETS. In the spiderweb-cracked mirror, his image is       
     deformed.                                                           

     Having found a weak spot, Ben savors his sweet victory when,
     suddenly, something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes-

     THE BULLET IMPACTS DISSOLVE AS IF BY MAGIC AND THE MIRRORS ARE
     RECONSTITUTED!

     Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage. He fires, in a fury,
     emptying the entire clip this time-

     Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face
     with his own reflection. He breaks down nervously-

                              BEN
                  Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU
                  HAVE TO KILL HER?

     Silence.

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  What is it you want? What do you want
                  from me? ANSWER ME! WHAT IS IT YOU
                  WANT?!

     Suddenly, one after the other, letters, start appearing in one
     of the mirrors, as if an invisible finger were tracing them in
     the dust-

     REKESSE

     Ben turns around, and in the reflection of the opposite mirror
     he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the
     note in Gary's wallet, the word Ben himself had traced in his
     bathroom mirror-

     ESSEKER

                                                             CUT TO:


72   INT. NIGHT -QUEENS APARTMENT                                       72

     Back in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep.        
     On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings,
     articles and photographs that Gary sent him.

     Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered            
     with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to              
     neutralize the reflective surfaces.                                     

     With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the
     middle of a heated conversation-

                                BEN
                  ...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra,                   
                  Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo...
                  Esseker. No idea, my guess is that                         
                  it's a name... No, I haven't got a first
                  name. Yes, in New York. Over the past
                  five or six years. I know it's hazy
                  but that's all I've got. I already
                  looked it up in the phone book. I also
                  called someone at the IRS and at the
                  DMV, but nothing there. It's very                          
                  important Larry. You'll call me back?                      
                  Ok...

     Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered
     with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of
     Gary's investigative research.

     All the articles date back approximately to the same period and
     are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years
     ago.

     But not a hint of Esseker.

     Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story
     together-

     " Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded "                    

     "   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered..."     

     " ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... "

     " ...the throat slit open... "

     " Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... "




                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                              54.

     " The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly
     denies the accusation of murdering his family... "

     " Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty-
     The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses. He started
     the fire in the department store with the intention of
     destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the
     death of his wife and three daughters. "

     Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive
     photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind,
     surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with    
     him.                                                                

     As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the      
     window-                                                             

     What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his
     family? Or what if the mirrors would do it?                         

     The phone rings-

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                  Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing
                  under that name? Shit, shit, shit,
                  shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence
                  Berry...

     Ben holds on the line, for a moment.

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                  ...Got anything? Great...No, I already
                  know all that. Is he still alive? No...
                  Can you find out where he was
                  committed before his death? Wait, I'm
                  writing it down...

     Ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a
     piece of paper.

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  ...Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention                     
                  Center... Yeah, I know where it is.                    
                  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone. Under the blanket, next to him, he spots
     the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night.            

     The pain is too strong. He cannot hold back his tears anymore       
     and starts crying.                                                  

                                                            CUT TO:

     The next morning -

     Heavy-eyed and sleepy, Michael is hypnotized in front of the
     weather forecast on TV.

     The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold. His
     sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice. Amy, shaking
     a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state-

                            AMY
                Do you want the cereal in your hot
                chocolate or in a separate bowl?

     The little boy does not answer.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                Michael?

                            MICHAEL
                In the chocolate...

                              AMY
                ...In the chocolate, please, mom...

                              MICHAEL
                      (repeating after her)
                ...Please, mom.

     She pours the cereal in his hot chocolate.

                            DAISY
                Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat
                that?

                            AMY
                Come on, come on, let's get going, or
                you're going to be late for school.

     Michael begins to eat his breakfast, his gaze still fixed on the
     weatherman's forecast on TV. As Amy fills the cat's bowl with
     pellets, Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family.

                             DAISY
                Mom?

                            AMY
                What is it sweetheart?

                            DAISY
                Do you know that Michael has a new
                friend?

                              MICHAEL
                  No, that's not true!

                              AMY
                  Really, what's his name?

                              MICHAEL
                      (to his sister)
                  You promised not to tell.

                              AMY
                  Does he go to your school?

     Michael doesn't answer. Daisy shakes her head.

                                AMY (CONT'D)
                      (pretending to be
                       indifferent)
                  Very well. If you don't want to tell
                  me about it...

     The little boy stays quiet.

                              MICHAEL
                  He doesn't want me to talk about him.

     Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to
     Michael-

                              AMY
                  Why doesn't he want you to talk about
                  him? Is he a grown up?

                             MICHAEL
                  No...

                              AMY
                  So, he's a little boy your age, then?

     Michael gives a reluctant nod. Amy is reassured. He finishes his
     mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink. Amy gives Daisy
     a questioning look-

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                      (to Michael)
                  Does he live in our street? Is it one
                  of our neighbors?

     Michael remains silent and Daisy answers for him-

                              DAISY
                  He lives in the mirror in our room.

     Daisy bursts out laughing... Michael glares back at her, furious.

     Puzzled, Amy reflects briefly on Daisy's remark-                     


                                                           (CONTINUED)

                            AMY (CONT'D)
                Michael, answer me. Did your father                        
                talk to you about the mirrors?                             

                               MICHAEL
                No Mommy.                                                  

     Amy questions him with her eyes. Michael lowers his.                  

                            AMY                                            
                OK... Come on, come on guys, let's get
                our teeth brushed, and our coats on.
                The first one in the car is the
                winner.

     The two kids dash up the stairs. Amy is left alone to clean up
     breakfast.

     She casts a glance at the front hall mirror. Daisy's comment
     lingers in her thoughts.

     Dressed in their coats, Michael and Daisy come running down the
     stairs and rush out of the house... Amy exits the house. The car
     drives away.

     Daisy's cat leaps onto the kitchen table and directs his gaze to
     the mirror-

     FOR NO APPARENT REASON, THE CAT SUDDENLY STIFFENS INTO A
     POSITION OF DEFENSE. HE BRISTLES HIS COAT AND HISSES AND SPITS
     TOWARDS HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR.

     Wide shot- The high security psychiatric hospital stands under a
     leaden sky -                                                          

                            DR. MORRIS (V.O.)                              
                You know, Mr. Carson, when one starts                      
                to perceive one's own reflection as a
                completely separate being, one is
                suddenly confronted with two entirely
                separate egos, two entirely separate
                worlds that can surface at any given
                moment-

75   INT. DAY - ROOSEVELT PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION CENTER              75

     DR. MORRIS, the doctor who had once been in charge of Terrence
     Berry, escorts Ben down the corridor-                               

                            DR. MORRIS
                A feeling of self-hatred, generally
                triggered by a psychological shock can
                split the personality in two, hence
                creating two or more personalities
                with distinct memories or behavior
                patterns within the same individual.
                The patient then has a faulty
                perception of the existence of two
                distinct worlds, which are principally
                the "real" word, and the world "inside
                the mirror".                                             

     The two men pass a number of guards and security check-points as
     they head down towards the hospital's film and video archive-

                            BEN
                Did you consider Terrence innocent?

     Dr. Morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic
     device, unlocking the door to the archives.

                            DR. MORRIS
                In my opinion, he was convinced that
                he was telling the truth when he
                claimed he didn't kill his family. I
                too am convinced that when it
                happened, Terrence was not himself,
                but rather his double, his mirror
                image, one might say.

     He enters the archives, followed by Ben-                            


76   INT. DAY - ARCHIVES- ROOSEVELT PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION CENTER    76   

     Dr. Morris' finger glides across several DV-tapes dated 2001 in
     search of one particular tape-

                            DR. MORRIS
                These recordings are from Terrence's
                trial. You will find that they speak
                for themselves.

     He pushes the tape into the deck. A grainy picture appears on
     the screen-

     We discover TERRENCE BERRY, sitting behind a desk. His hands are
     cuffed. Facing him, DR. MORRIS is leading the cross-examination.

     Terrence is tense and uncomfortable. He keeps his face down,
     never looking into the camera.

     DESPITE HAVING SURVIVED THE FIRE, TERRENCE'S FACE IS NONETHELESS
     DISFIGURED BY THIRD DEGREE BURNS. HE NO LONGER HAS FACIAL
     FEATURES, AND HE STRUGGLES WITH HIS SPEECH.

                              DR. MORRIS (CONT'D)
                  Why did you set the department store
                  on fire?

                                TERRENCE
                  In order to... to destroy the mirrors.
                  Only fire can destroy a mirror, isn't
                  that right, Doctor?

                              DR. MORRIS
                  What made you think you absolutely had
                  to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?

     Terrence remains silent. Dr. Morris repeats his question-

                              DR. MORRIS (CONT'D)
                  What made you want to destroy those
                  mirrors, Terrence?

                              TERRENCE
                  They killed Helen and my three little
                  girls...

                              DR. MORRIS
                  For what reason? Why would mirrors
                  want to kill your family?

                              TERRENCE
                  Because I didn't...

     Terrence breaks out in tears.

                              DR. MORRIS
                  Didn't do what?

     With his eyes fixed on the video monitor, deep inside, Ben
     already knows the answer that Terrence is about to give...

                              TERRENCE
                  They asked me to find Esseker...   Like                 
                  they did with the others...

                  about?

                I didn't succeed. I didn't succeed in
                finding Esseker...

     Ben realizes that he's in the exact same situation-

                I have to go.

     He stands to leave. The monitor keeps playing the old footage-       

                            DR. MORRIS                                    
                Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.

                Who is Esseker, Terrence?                                 

     Suddenly, Terrence's behavior shifts to another extreme. He
     stands up, and flying into a rage, he becomes brutal and
     hysterical-

                            TERRENCE
                I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS! I DON'T
                KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS, I DON'T KNOW!!

     Terrence becomes uncontrollable. He wrecks the folders lying on
     the desk and throws himself, head first, against a wall mirror
     that shatters to pieces.

     He is beside himself. After seeing the video footage on              
     Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family-

     Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben
     agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor. He
     is removing the mirrors from each and every room.

     He tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far
     end of the hallway, and removes some from Amy's room...

     Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under
     her protective arms. Amy is not back yet.

     The only mirror left that Ben cannot remove, is the one in the
     children's room.

     He rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of
     old paint. He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in
     order to neutralize its reflection.

                  Don't worry, there's nothing wrong.
                  Everything is OK...

                              DAISY
                  But why are you doing that?

                              BEN
                  I'm doing it to protect you.

     At the same time, Amy's car pulls up in front of the house.

     As soon as she sees the front door open, and the mirrors laid
     out on the landing of the front steps, Amy rushes into the
     house, panic-stricken.

     She races up the stairs to the second floor, barging into the
     children's room where Ben is painting the mirror. She signals
     Rosa to take the kids out.

                              AMY
                  Do you mind telling me what the hell
                  you're doing?

     Focused and determined, Ben does not answer her question.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                  Ben!

                  Look Amy, you've got to trust me, I
                  know what I'm doing... It's for your own
                  good.

                              AMY
                  I want you to stop what you're doing
                  and get out of our house right now.

                  You're scaring the kids acting like                     
                  this.

     Ben continues to paint the mirror.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                  If you don't leave immediately, I'm
                  going to call the police, Ben, and I
                  warn you, you will never see your
                  children again. Do you understand what
                  I'm saying?

     Ben stops-

                              BEN
                  You have to trust me Amy, I'm not
                  completely crazy... These mirrors are
                  dangerous. At first, I thought it was
                  only the ones at the store, but now I
                  know they can get you anywhere. They                    
                  got Angela... I promise I'll leave the                  
                  house once I've taken them all down.

                                AMY
                  Do you realize what you're saying,
                  Ben? What is wrong with you? I know                     
                  that what you're going through isn't                    
                  easy. Angela was a part of our lives                    
                  too, but you have no right to do this                   
                  to us... Ever since your obsession with
                  these damn mirrors the kids are scared
                  to death. Your son has nightmares.                      
                  He's scared Ben... Your behavior is
                  starting to rub off on him. He's only
                  5 years old... And I have to protect                    
                  him.                                                    

     Ben can see that she is very upset about the situation. He sets
     down the paint bucket on the floor-

                              BEN
                  Come Amy, come with me, I want to show
                  you something.

     He leads her back down, through the first floor, and out on the
     front steps of the house-

                  Look, you'll see...

     Ben pulls his Magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one
     of the mirrors he has dragged outside.

     Amy steps back, terrified-


                                                            (CONTINUED)

                              AMY
                  What are you doing with that gun... Put
                  it down, BEN... PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW!

     Without a moment's hesitation, Ben opens fire. The mirror
     shatters to pieces-

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                  ARE YOU CRAZY BEN? HAVE YOU GONE
                  COMPLETELY MAD?

     Ben smiles, all excited-

                              BEN
                  Wait, look, you'll see...

     Through the front window, Daisy and Michael witness the scene-

                              AMY
                  SEE WHAT, BEN?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO
                  SEE ?!

     Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror,
     waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to
     dissolve again-

     BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THE CRACKS REMAIN, IN A SPIDER WEB PATTERN.

     Behind the front door, Ben notices Michael, watching him, in
     tears.

     Without any evidence, Ben is in over his head.

                                BEN
                  But... I swear to you I... I saw...Amy...

     The neighbors, alerted by the blast of the gun, come out of
     their houses to find out what has happened.

     Ben stands alone, looking like a mad man...

     Amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control-

                                AMY
                  Get out...now! I don't ever want to see
                  you here again, Ben. And I'll have the
                  lawyers make sure the same goes for
                  the kids. You are insane, Ben, and
                  dangerous... You've got to get help.

     With gun in hand, Ben walks away, dismayed, as he gradually
     becomes aware of the situation he has just created.

     He enters his car and drives off at top speed.

                                                                64.




82   EXT/INT. DAY - ROAD - BEN'S CAR                                  82

     Ben drives nervously. He feels guilty about his conduct in front
     of the children. A thousand thoughts rush through his head,
     leaving him in an utter state of confusion. He doesn't know what
     to do nor what to think anymore.

     Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number-

                            BEN
                Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to
                need your help again-

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                Come on, Ben... For Christ's sake! What                    
                are you doing?

                Mayflower used to be a hospital before                     
                it became a department store. St.
                John's Hospital. Do you have any idea
                where all the medical records could
                have ended up after it closed down?

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                How am I supposed to know that?!

                            BEN
                Go to the city hall archives... They
                must have something considering it was
                a public hospital.

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                I've got others things to do. I can't                      
                go to City Hall today. I've -

                Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go
                myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go
                to the City Hall archives, and ask
                them to look up Esseker among the
                former patients. Please.

                  Talk to you later.

     Ben hangs up.

     He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S
     CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT!

     Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at
     full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision.

     Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely
     avoiding a fatal crash.

     He stops along the edge of the road.

     Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering
     wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear-
     view mirror again-

     ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair,
     she fixes him with a milky gaze.

     Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS
     BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS...

     Ben is alone and lost.

     Insert on what is written on the side rear-view mirror-

83   EXT. NIGHT -MANHATTAN STREET - NYPD POLICE STATION              83

     Under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in
     front of the police station.

     A bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an
     adjacent street. Ben is waiting inside.                              

     A man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the
     vehicle. It's LARRY-                                                 

     The rainwater drips down his raincoat. Under his arm he holds a      
     file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag.                         

                              LARRY

                  does the history of the Mayflower have

                  I don't know exactly. I can't tell                     
                  you, but some really fucked up things                  
                  started happening to me when I took                    
                  the job over there. Nothing makes any                  
                  sense to me either but I have to                       
                  follow my instinct.

                  files? Did you go to City Hall?

                  No, you were wrong about that, they                    
                  had nothing. All the medical records                   
                  from St. John's Hospital are still up                  
                  there with the unclassified cases.

                  She was a patient at St. John's in the
                  psych ward run by a Dr. Kane, between
                  March and September 1952. She was only
                  twelve years old when she died...

                When the nurses went on their rounds,
                first thing on the morning of October                      
                6th, they discovered that all the
                patients had left their rooms during
                the night and gathered in the main
                room. All of them were dead, including                     
                the girl. Apparently, they had killed                      
                one another... A slaughter house... After                  
                that they shut down the place. Nobody                      
                ever found out what really happened.

                He was arrested. They found him dead
                on the first day of his hearing. He
                had slit his wrists with a piece of

     He walks through the lobby of his building.

     Angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness-                      

     Ben lays Anna Esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the
     desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall.

     He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it.

     WHY ARE THE MIRRORS ASKING FOR ANNA IF SHE'S ALREADY DEAD? WHY?       
     IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE...                                          

     On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952,
     Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address.

     Dr. Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - "Despite her young
     age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to
     withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior."

     He shuffles through the first few pages of various                    
     administrative documents.                                             

     His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time        
     she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six
     male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front
     of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she
     struggles like a wild animal.

     A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben
     turns around-

     Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in      
     the apartment.                                                        

     Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the
     sheet hanging on the frame-

     A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben
     casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on
     Anna's file laying on the desk-

     He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents
     it to the mirror-

     KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of
     pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a
     reaction to the photograph...

                              BEN                                          
                  You're still alive, aren't you?                          

     All of a sudden, Ben realizes something. He runs back to the          
     file on the table and goes through the documents again, one by        
     one.                                                                  

     He stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks       
     the date.

     Through the half-opened door at the end of the hallway, we see
     Daisy brushing her teeth before going to school. The little girl        
     is humming as she watches herself in the mirror...

     Amy comes out of her room-

                              AMY
                  Come on, come on... Let's go... Daisy,
                  Michael?

     She passes in front of the children's room and stops- INSIDE,           
     MICHAEL IS TALKING TO SOMEBODY. Amy listens closely, but she can        
     only hear Michael's voice. On the other side of the door, the           
     little boy bursts out in laughter-

     She opens the door and finds her son squatting in front of the
     mirror, talking to his own reflection.

                              AMY
                  What are you doing Michael? Come on,
                  we're going to be late.

     The little boy does as his mother says.      He gets up and dashes
     out of the room.

     Amy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her
     balance-

     MICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A
     SQUATTING POSITION!

     HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE.

     Amy attempts to speak but can't-

     The mirror image of her son remains silent.

     Amy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind
     the boy, she discovers-

     HER MIRROR IMAGE IS THERE TOO, BEARING THE SAME FORCED GRIN...

     help he paints over all the mirrors in the house. In the face of

     connection between the two of them.                                   

     The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely
     with newspaper and tape.

     Every inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the TV-
     screen and the shiny taps, have been "neutralized" with strips
     of masking tape...

     IN NO TIME, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SURFACE CAPABLE OF REFLECTING
     LIGHT LEFT IN THE HOUSE.

94   EXT. DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                       94

     The front door of the house opens. On the landing of the front
     steps, Ben kisses Daisy goodbye.

                              DAISY
                  When will you be back, Dad?

                              BEN
                  As quickly as I can, sweetheart. I
                  promise.

     He kisses Michael who hugs him back-

                              MICHAEL
                  I love you, Dad.

     He strokes Michael gently on the head and goes to his car. Daisy
     and Michael watch their father leave.

     Amy walks him to the vehicle-

                              AMY
                  What if you don't find her? Maybe she
                  doesn't live there anymore? Maybe
                  she's really dead.                                    

                              BEN
                  They want her, I'm gonna find her                     
                  wherever she is. We don't have any                    
                  other choice.                                         

     Ben holds her tightly in his arms and plants a tender kiss on
     her forehead.

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                  I'm sorry about everything I've put
                  you through... I didn't want to...

     Amy interrupts him.

                              AMY
                  I know.

     Ben gets into the car.

                              BEN
                  Amy, I want you to stay here with the                 
                  kids until all this is over. All the
                  mirrors are covered, there's no more
                  danger. I'll come back as soon as I                   
                  can.

     Tears well up in Amy's eyes. He takes her hand-

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  Hey baby, everything's gonna be fine.
                  I love you.

     She smiles tenderly. Ben drives off.

                                                                73.




95    INT. DAY - BEN'S CAR                                            95

      Through the back window, we see Amy in front of the house,            
      growing more and more distant.

      Anna's medical file lies open on the passenger seat- At the top
      of the page we can read her old address in Pennsylvania.


96    EXT. DAY - ROAD                                                 96

      -Aerial shot-

      We fly over a lake- the waters are so placid that the forest and
      outline of the scenery surrounding it reflect off its surface,
      creating two perfectly symmetrical landscapes.

      We glide over the treetops, diving deeper into the forest, to
      follow the main road that zigzags along the slope of the hill.

      A sign on the edge of the road indicates 67 miles to                  
      Pennsylvania.                                                         

      Ben focuses on the road, determined to put an end to what hides       
      behind the mirrors and to rescue his family.

99    EXT. DAY - COUNTRY ROAD                                         99

      Ben's car slows down as he reaches a dirt road.

      On one of the mailboxes standing on the edge of the road he
      spots the name Esseker-


100   EXT. DAY - ESSEKER FARMHOUSE                                    100

      The wind blows over the land.

      In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to
      the few starving crows flying over them. A feeling of desolation
      and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape.

      Ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the
      countryside down a winding dirt road.

      An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path. If it
      weren't for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running
      wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned.

      Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door.

      His shoes sink into the mud. He walks up the steps of the porch
      and peeks inside the house through the front window. In the dark
      he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV. He
      can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or           
      turned towards the wall.                                             

      A big dog barks behind the window. Ben steps back, surprised.

      The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence
      known. A young man stares at him in silence.

                                 BEN
                   Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse?

      The young man nods.

      A woman's voice is heard from inside-

                               WOMAN'S VOICE
                   What is it Jimmy?

                               JIMMY
                   I don't know Mom.
                       (to Ben)
                   What can I do for you sir?

                               BEN
                   I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker.

      The young man looks at Ben questioningly. Apparently he has
      never heard the name before.

                               JIMMY
                       (to his mother inside)
                   There's a man who's looking for...
                       (back to Ben)
                   You said Anna?
                       (Ben confirms)
                   Anna Esseker, Mom!

      Jimmy's mother, in her fifties, an obese woman who has trouble
      moving around- shows up in the opening of the door -

                               JIMMY'S MOTHER
                   What is it you want with Anna Esseker?                  

      She catches him unaware. Ben makes up a false identity-

                               BEN
                 I huh... I am doing some research for a
                 book on the history of St. John's
                 Hospital, in New York...

      Jimmy's mother stares at him for a moment with a suspicious look-

                             JIMMY'S MOTHER
                 Jimmy, go tell grandpa that there's a
                 man here who'd like to talk to him
                 about his sister.


101   INT. DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT                                101

      We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to
      the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to
      the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old,         
      Anna's elder brother.

      Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him-           

                             ROBERT
                 You know, up to this day, the visions                    
                 of Anna's fits still haunt me at
                 night.                                                   

      They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door.          

                             ROBERT (CONT'D)
                  I helped my father fix up this part
                 of the basement, especially for her-

      The old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door
      swings open, revealing-

                             ROBERT (CONT'D)
                 Her fits were too violent. My mother
                 couldn't take her screams anymore.

      What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY
      DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more
      resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST
      FEROCIOUS BEAST.                                                    

      As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from
      that time come back to him-

      Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of
      hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her    
      howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her
      unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and
      legs.




                                                           (CONTINUED)

101   CONTINUED:                                                 101


                               ROBERT (CONT'D)
                   We had every priest, doctor, healer,
                   coming from all over the state, one
                   after the other. But no one could help
                   her.                                                   

      Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's
      scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of
      her plight and suffering.

                               ROBERT (CONT'D)
                   Finally, Dr. Kane from New York
                   answered my parents' cry for help. He
                   rejected the idea of demonic
                   possession, said he didn't believe in
                   it. He was convinced that Anna
                   suffered from a rare form of
                   personality disorder. He wanted Anna                   
                   under his care, at St. John's. My
                   parents were very poor, but he agreed
                   to cover all the hospital costs... In                  
                   less than five months, Dr. Kane had
                   cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She
                   was her old self again. A real miracle
                   of science.

                               BEN                                        
                   And after the hospital?                                

                               ROBERT                                     
                   You don't know? She died there with                    
                   all of Kane's other patients.                          

      Ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to    
      Robert.

                   Anna left the hospital two days before                 
                   the massacre. Kane changed the records                 
                   to make her disappear.                                 

                               ROBERT                                     
                   You're not a journalist, are you? What                 
                   do you want?

                   I want to know. After St. John's,                      
                   where did she go?                                      

      Robert stares at Ben, unsure of saying what he's about to reveal    
      to this perfect stranger-

                   Anna came back to live with us for a
                   while...

      Robert lowers his eyes.                                             

                             BEN (CONT'D)

                 Because... Because strange things                        
                 started to happen in the house...

                             ROBERT
                 No, not with Anna...

      The old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details. The
      memories are too painful.

                             BEN
                 With the mirrors?

      Robert stiffens, eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know?

                             BEN (CONT'D)                                 
                 Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find
                 your sister. It's very important. It's                   
                 a matter of life and death.                              

      Robert hesitates -

                             ROBERT                                       
                 Before he died, Kane sent us a letter                    
                 asking us to keep Anna away from
                 mirrors and that whatever happens she                    
                 should be in a place where the mirrors                   
                 could never find her.                                    

                             BEN
                 Where is she now?                                        

                             ROBERT
                 To protect us, she left the house and                    
                 joined the monastic orders, where
                 mirrors are forbidden... St. Augustine's                 
                 monastery, on the road to Midwich.


102   EXT. DAY - ESSEKER FARMHOUSE                                  102

      Ben's car does a one-eighty turn in front of the farmhouse,
      heading back to the main road.

      Standing on the porch, with an anxious look on his face, Robert
      watches him disappear in the distance.

      He sits down on the steps, and wipes his glasses.

      The crows fly low in the sky- It's a bad sign.

                                                              CUT TO :


103   EXT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY                                   103

      The nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard.

      A deadly silence prevails over the monastery, where time seems
      to stand still. All these women have taken vows of poverty,
      obedience and chastity to serve god.

      On the other side of the cloister wall, a small winding road
      zigzags between the pine trees. Ben's car draws nearer. He parks      
      in front of the entrance to the monastery.                            


104   INT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE                         104

      Ben pushes open the heavy front door. The place is dark and           
      silent. He goes to the front desk-                                    

      Behind a wooden screen he can barely make out the two nuns in
      charge of admissions. They are the only nuns granted exposure to
      the outside world. For the rest, physical and visual contact is
      strictly prohibited.

                               SISTER
                   Yes, how can I help you?

                               BEN
                   Hello Sister. I have come to visit a
                   member of your community... Sister Anna?                 
                   Her real name is Anna Esseker.                           

                               SISTER
                   Is she expecting you?

                               BEN
                   No, not really.

                               SISTER
                   Are you a relative?

                               BEN                                          
                   Listen, Sister, I must see her.

                               SISTER
                   If you are not listed, I cannot help
                   you sir.

                               SISTER (CONT'D)
                   We have strict regulations concerning
                   visitations, which are exclusively for
                   family members.

                               BEN                                          
                   Please, tell her that I came all the
                   way from New York and that I work with
                   Dr. Kane at St. John's Hospital...                       

                               SISTER
                   Wait here for a moment.

      She stands up and escapes through one of the back doors.

      The other nun behind the screen, observes Ben with curiosity.

      Time goes by, and Ben grows impatient.


107   INT. DAY - HOUSE NEW JERSEY                                     107   

      Inside the house in Jersey, Amy has isolated herself with the         
      kids in the parent's bedroom. She's reading them a bedtime            
      story.                                                                

      Even if all the windows, screens, and TV are covered by               
      newspapers or painting, Amy acts in front of Daisy and Michael        
      as if nothing has happened.                                           

      In the rest of the house, everything has been meticulously            
      covered, wrapped, painted or reversed. Still, here and there, a       
      barely audible rustle pierces through the silence-

      In the children's room, the paint covering the mirror slowly
      begins to flake off...

      The newspaper wrapped around the windowpanes begins to rip...

      THE MIRRORS ARE RESISTING AND ATTEMPTING TO SET THEMSELVES FREE.      


107A INT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE                        107A

      Ben is losing his calm. Time is running out. The nun reappears        
      behind the wooden screen-

                               SISTER                                       
                   Sister Anna has agreed to talk to you,
                   you may proceed to the parlor next
                   door.

      Ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures
      him to.

      He enters the parlor alone. In the spare room, a chair stands by
      a wooden screen, fencing him off, once again.



                                                             (CONTINUED)

     Behind the screen, a silhouette awaits him.

                              SISTER ANNA
                  St. John's closed down in 1952. Who
                  are you?

     Ben sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the
     face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna.

                              BEN
                  My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as                  
                  a night watchman at 1229 West 38th                     
                  Street in New York City, what used to
                  be St. John's Hospital.

                              SISTER ANNA
                  What is it you want Mr. Carson?                        

                              BEN
                  I need your help.                                      

                              SISTER ANNA
                  My help? I don't quite see how I could
                  possibly be of any help.

                              BEN
                  My wife and children are in danger.                    
                  What is threatening my family is                       
                  asking for you...                                      

     For a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the
     screen. She has understood...

                              BEN (CONT'D)                               
                  If you don't help me I may lose the
                  only thing that matters to me.

                              SISTER ANNA                                
                  I cannot leave the precincts. It's                     
                  impossible.                                            

                              BEN                                        
                  Tell me why are the mirrors from the
                  old hospital so determined to find
                  you?

     Sister Anna remains silent-

                              BEN (CONT'D)                               
                  I must know, Sister.

                              SISTER ANNA
                  It is not the wish of the mirrors to
                  find me, but of what is imprisoned
                  inside them. The mirrors are merely
                  windows on our world...

                A window... For what? For whom?                        

                            ANNA
                At the time that I was at St. John's,                  
                Dr. Kane's therapy for personality                     
                disorders consisted of locking the                     
                patient up in a mirrored room for                      
                several days on end, in order to force
                him to confront his own image. I spent                 
                the darkest days of my life in that
                room. On the 6th day the nurses found
                me lifeless, almost dead. Since that                   
                day, I have never had another fit. But
                deep down inside I've always known the
                truth.

                              BEN
                What truth?

                            ANNA
                There is no cure for schizophrenia, it
                was something else, Mr. Carson. And                    
                whatever it was, it entered the
                mirror.                                                

     We can feel the emotion in her voice.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)                              
                I thought that after fifty years, this
                would have all gone away. They would
                have disappeared from the mirrors. I
                didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I                     
                agree to go with you and return to
                that place, I will make it possible
                for them to cross the threshold back
                into the real world.                                   

     Everything is now making sense for Ben-                           

                            BEN                                        
                It entered with you and they need you                  
                to get out.                                            

                            ANNA
                The consequences of such an act, Mr.                   
                Carson, would be more devastating than                 
                letting them suffer where they are                     
                now. I'm going to pray for you and                     
                your family. That's all I can do right
                now, Mr. Carson. God bless you...                      

     She stands to leave.

                 Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence                   
                 Berry, Gary Lewis and many others

                 died trying to find you. Because they
                 failed, their families died too. My                     
                 sister was murdered two days ago... My

                 come with me. Look-

      From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael,
      as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the
      picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna
      to look at it.

                             BEN (CONT'D)
                 My wife and two children. They're all
                 I've got. They're innocent... Please.                   

      Anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves.            

                             BEN (CONT'D)
                 I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK

                 THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE.

                 ON YOUR TIME!                                           

      Anna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance.               

      Ben failed. He's desperate and lost. He has a hard time            
      containing his anger.                                              


105   EXT. DAY - MONASTERY                                         105

      On the horizon, a red sun sets behind the treetops. It's almost
      nightfall.

      The bells from the monastery begin to toll.

      The cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle
      of rain water.

      Frustrated, Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number    
      on his cell phone -                                                


106   EXT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                 106

      In the distance, the lights of Manhattan sparkle in the night.

      In the house, all the lights are off.

      All is quiet, too quiet.                                           

                                                                 83.




108   INT. NIGHT - HALLWAY                                             108

      In the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to Amy's bedroom is
      the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten.

      In the distorted reflection, we see Michael's silhouette
      approaching. The little boy reaches for the knob but-

      IN REALITY, NO HAND TOUCHES IT-

      IT'S MICHAEL'S REFLECTION INSIDE THE SHINY KNOB THAT IS OPENING
      THE DOOR!

      Inside the bedroom, Amy fell asleep with Daisy in her arms.            

      On the bedside table, THE HOME PHONE STARTS RINGING- She wakes         
      up with a jolt and picks up the cordless receiver-                     

                             AMY                                             
                 Hello? Ben... Where are you? Did you                        
                 find her? Did you talk to...                                

      She stops speaking as she realizes- Daisy is asleep next to her        
      but MICHAEL IS NO LONGER THERE.                                        

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 Michael? MICHAEL!?                                          
                     (on the phone)
                 Ben hold on, Michael is gone...                             

                             BEN (O.S.)                                      
                 What?

                             AMY                                             
                     (to Ben on the phone)                                   
                 I don't know, I fell asleep with the
                 kids on the bed and...                                      

      She sees that THE BEDROOM DOOR IS HALF OPENED.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 Michael?                                                    

      The sound of pouring water is heard, coming from the hallway.
      Michael must be in the bathroom.

                             BEN (O.S.)                                      
                 Amy, what's going on? Are you alright?

      Amy runs to the door, waking Daisy up.                                 

                             DAISY
                 What is it Mom?

                   Ben, I have to call you back, I have                   
                   to find Michael...

109   INT. NIGHT - CORRIDOR/BATHROOM -      CONTINUITY              109

      Amy comes out of the bedroom and notices that the floor is          
      completely soaked.                                                  

      She turns on the light in the hallway, only to discover-

      The entire upper floor is covered by an inch of water- all the      
      taps in the bathroom are turned on and have transformed the
      surface of the floor into A LARGE NATURAL MIRROR...

                               AMY                                        
                       (to Ben on the phone)
                   Fuck! There is water everywhere...                     
                   Michael? Michael? MICHAEL?!                            

      Amy freezes when she realizes that all the picture frames and
      all the mirrors in the corridor have been scraped, bringing the
      reflecting surfaces, once again, to the light...

                               AMY (CONT'D)                               
                       (scared)                                           
                   Ben, someone scraped all the
                   mirrors... There is someone in the                     
                   house.

                               BEN (O.S.)                                 
                   Where is Michael?

                               AMY                                        
                       (panicked)
                   I don't know where he is. I don't see                  
                   him. I...                                              

      As she turns in the hallway, Amy sees A DARK SHADOW MOVING IN       
      ONE OF THE MIRRORS. Terrified, she steps back and hits the          
      opposite wall. She drops the phone on the flooded floor-            


109A EXT. DAY - MONASTERY                                          109A

      At the same moment, Ben, still outside of the monastery, is cut     
      off in his conversation with his wife-


                                                           (CONTINUED)

109A CONTINUED:                                                109A


                              BEN
                  Amy? Amy? Answer me?                                   

     He tried to redial but that doesn't work. He knows something        
     weird is happening there.                                           

     Without hesitation, Ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks      
     back towards the monastery gates.                                   


109B -BACK IN THE HOUSE-                                        109B     

     Unsure of what she saw, Amy makes a step towards the mirror but     
     only finds her own reflection.

     She picks up the phone- The water shorted it out...                 

                               AMY                                       
                  Damn it...                                             

     Cautiously, Amy walks up to the bathroom.                           

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                  Michael?                                               

     She opens the door- the sink and bathtub are filled with water
     overflowing onto the tiled floor. Michael is not there.             

                                                           CUT TO:       


109C INT. NIGHT - MONASTERY CELL                                109C

     A hand enters frame to light some candles.                          

     Sister Anna is back in her cell. The way her hand shakes as she     
     carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset    
     she is by the confrontation with Ben- It's been too much time       
     that she's carrying the guilt.                                      

     She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels        
     down in front of her bed to pray when-

     A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is        
     heard outside the cell. Someone has broken into the monastery.      
     She recognizes Ben's voice- Like a mad man, he's looking for her    
     everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way.        

     Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his    
     hand. Behind him, the other nuns are terrified.                     

     Ben points the gun at Anna-                                         

                              BEN                                        
                  My kids are not going to die tonight.                  
                  You're coming with me, now.                            


                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                              86.
109C CONTINUED:                                                 109C


      Not intimidated by the weapon, Anna steps towards Ben. FOR THE     
      FIRST TIME, BEN CAN SEE HER FACE- The old lady seems more          
      determined than ever-

                              ANNA
                  If I come with you Mr. Carson, you                     
                  have to promise to do everything I
                  tell you. My way. No questions.

      Ben lowers his gun-                                                

                              BEN
                  You have my word.

110   INT. NIGHT- BEDROOM- MEANWHILE                               110

      Daisy waits patiently in the bed following her mother's
      instructions. Suddenly she hears her mother calling her from the
      children's bedroom-

                                AMY (O.S.)
                  Daisy... Daisy... Come here...                         

      Daisy steps into the corridor and stops, for a moment, when she
      notices the flooding. She enters her bedroom, following the
      voice that calls out for her-

                                AMY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Daisy... Daisy...


111   INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUITY                 111

      Daisy explores the bedroom. The voice is still calling, but her
      mother is not there.

      The door shuts behind her.

      She walks up to the mirror on the wall. The paint has been
      partially scraped off-

      THE LITTLE GIRL DISCOVERS HER MOTHER'S REFLECTION ON THE OTHER
      SIDE OF THE MIRROR-


112   INT. NIGHT - BATHROOM - MEANWHILE                            112

      BUT IN REALITY, AMY IS STILL IN THE BATHROOM!

      She turns off the tap and sinks her hand into the depths of the
      bathtub to pull the plug, when she sees Michael's reflection on
      the surface -

                   Micha...

      She turns around, but Michael is not behind her. The reflection
      lied.

      SUDDENLY HER ARM IS PULLED INTO THE BATHTUB.                         

      AN INVISIBLE FORCE PLUNGES HER HEAD INTO THE WATER TO DROWN HER.
      AMY STRUGGLES FRENETICALLY BUT THE PRESSURE IS TOO STRONG FOR
      HER TO BREAK FREE.


113   -BACK IN THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOM-                              113

      Daisy walks up to her mother's reflection in the mirror.

                               AMY'S REFLECTION
                   Come sweetheart... Come, come closer...
                   Come...

      Daisy is mistrustful. She senses that something is not right. In
      the mirror, her mother's attitude is different and strange...

                               DAISY
                   What are you doing in there, Mom?

                               AMY'S REFLECTION
                   Come closer, don't worry... Everything
                   is all right, sweetheart.

      Daisy obeys when, suddenly, she notices that her mother holds a
      pair of scissors in her hand.

      Daisy has no time to react-

      THE REFLECTION OF THE MOTHER GRABS THE REFLECTION OF THE LITTLE
      GIRL, HOLDING HER FIRMLY IN HER ARMS-

      BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE, IN REALITY, DAISY IS SUSPENDED IN THE
      AIR IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR.


114   -BACK IN THE BATHROOM -                                       114

      With her head still submerged in the bathtub, Amy is drowning.       
      She tries to fight back. Unsuccessfully. Her head stays under
      the water.

      With the tips of her fingers, Amy feels her way to the plug. She
      pulls it out.

      Slowly, the water level begins to go down. Too slowly. Amy
      struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again.

114   CONTINUED:                                                    114


      The water continues to recede. Amy has reached exhaustion, her
      hands clutch onto the edge of the bathtub. She is suffocating.

      At the last minute, she turns her head to gasp for air.

      The remaining water swirls down the drain. The bathtub is now       
      empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished.

      Amy collapses to the ground, spitting and coughing. She comes to
      her senses, gets back to her feet and dashes out of the
      bathroom.

                               AMY
                   Michael?! Michael?

      As she runs past the bedroom, she notices that the door is open-

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                   Daisy !?

      Daisy is no longer there.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                   Daisy !

      Panicked, Amy crosses the corridor and barges into the
      children's room. Inside she discovers-


115   INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S ROOM                                  115

      SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, A FEW INCHES OFF THE GROUND, DAISY
      STRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE.

      In the mirror, Amy sees her own reflection bringing the sharp
      blade of the scissors to her daughter's throat. The blade glides    
      over her skin.

      In reality, A TRICKLE OF BLOOD APPEARS ON DAISY'S THROAT.

      Instinctively, Amy throws herself against Daisy, tearing her
      away from the grip of her own reflection. They land on the floor    
      and crawl to the corner of the room, safe from the danger of the
      reflections.

      Amy tears off a piece of her clothing, which she presses against
      Daisy's throat in order to stop the bleeding.

                               AMY
                   Oh my god, don't move baby, don't
                   move...

      Amy is out of control, holding Daisy tightly in her arms. She is
      terror-stricken by the events in the house...




                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                              89.
115   CONTINUED:                                                 115


                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Don't move sweetheart...

      Fortunately, Daisy's wound is not deep. The blade did not reach
      the main artery. Amy saved her life at the very last minute.

      Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood. She struggles to
      speak-

                               DAISY
                   Why did you do this, Mom?

                               AMY
                       (in tears)
                   It wasn't me Daisy, it wasn't me... I
                   would never hurt you, you know that.

                                 DAISY
                   Whe...where is Michael ?

                                 AMY
                   I don't know where he is... I'm going to
                   take care of you and then we're going
                   to find him...OK But for now, we have to
                   get out of here.

                               DAISY
                   Is Daddy coming back soon?

                               AMY
                   Yes, he'll be here soon as he can.

      A bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we
      can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on     
      the floor-                                                         

      IN THIS EVIL VERSION OF THE REALITY, Amy's double has killed her   
      own daughter. Using the scissors, she's "working" on the dead      
      body. What exactly is she doing to the little girl?                

      She turns toward us, revealing HER FACE AND HANDS COVERED WITH     
      FRESH BLOOD!                                                       

      AMY'S REFLECTION COMES CLOSER TO PEEK THROUGH THE MIRROR , WITH    
      HER HANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS, AS IF IT WERE JUST A
      WINDOW.

      IN SEARCH OF THE REAL AMY AND DAISY, the forces of the mirrors     
      are determined to get them.

      Away from the field of vision of the mirror, Amy crawls on the
      floor towards the door-

                                                              90.




116   INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM                                          116

      Amy comes back to the bedroom, carrying Daisy in her arms.

      As she passes the bureau, she grabs the first-aid-kit from one
      of the drawers. She sets her daughter down in the walk-in           
      closet, away from the mirrors. The little girl has trouble
      moving.

      Amy examines the cut on Daisy's throat. Quickly, with a
      professional touch, she disinfects and bandages the wound.

                             AMY
                 Listen to me carefully Daisy... I want
                 you to stay in here and be quiet.

      Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength, she holds on
      to her mother tightly.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 You have to be brave, sweetheart... I
                 want you to stay in here and not get
                 out until I come back, no matter what
                 happens. I'm going to find Michael... Do
                 you hear me?

      Not quite convinced, Daisy accepts reluctantly.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 I am so proud of you.

      Amy shuts the door of the closet. Through the wooden slats she
      can see her daughter inside-

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                 Don't move...

      Amy exits the room.


117   INT. NIGHT - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE                               117

      Even though she turned off the taps upstairs Amy can still hear     
      the water pouring downstairs...

      On guard, Amy walks down the stairs, step by step. She is
      frightened and her heart is pounding.

                             AMY
                 Michael ? Michael ?

      At the bottom of the stairs, Amy catches sight of Michael at the
      other end of the living room.




                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                                91.
117   CONTINUED:                                                   117


      The first floor is completely flooded. ALL THE SPACE IS COVERED
      BY A THIN LAYER OF WATER THAT'S MIRRORING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE.      

      The little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the
      paint off the mirror with a sharp knife... It was Michael who had
      scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force
      of the mirrors free.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael !

      He doesn't answer. He doesn't seem to hear her.

      Amy comes down the last step.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael ? What are you doing?

      The little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile-

      IN THE MIRROR, HIS REFLECTION REMAINS FACING THEM.

                               MICHAEL
                   They want to come play with us, Mommy.

      Amy moves slowly towards her son.

                               AMY
                   Michael, I want you to drop that
                   knife, do you hear me? You know very
                   well you are not allowed to play with
                   that, don't you?

      Michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   That's a good boy, now give me the
                   knife...

      Instead of obeying, Michael runs off and disappears into another
      room on the first floor.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   MICHAEL !

      Amy rushes after him.


118   INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM                                         118

      Amy's cell phone, laying on the night table, begins to ring. On
      the display we can see the call is from Ben.

      Through the wooden slats of the closet door, Daisy catches sight
      of the phone.                                                       



                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                                   92.

      She thinks about leaving the closet to answer, but remembers her
      mother's strict instructions about staying in the hiding place.

      The phone continues to ring, but no one answer it.


119   INT. NIGHT - FIRST FLOOR                                         119

      Amy hears the phone ringing upstairs, but she cannot answer it
      now- She must find Michael first.

                                                                CUT TO :


120   EXT/INT. NIGHT - BEN'S CAR - MANHATTAN                           120

      Ben's car drives down a Manhattan street.

      Behind the wheel, Ben is on the phone and gets Amy's voicemail.
      He dials again-

                               BEN
                   Answer! God damn it... Answer the phone...

      Once again he gets the voicemail.

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                   Fuck...

      Ben is losing his calm.


121   EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          121

      Ben's car pulls up in front of the department store. Through the
      windshield, Anna catches sight of the devastated building.

      Ben hangs up the phone-                                                 

                               BEN
                   Something's wrong over there, my wife                      
                   is not answering.                                          

      Ben is torn - He knows that going back to Amy isn't going to            
      help-                                                                   

                               BEN (CONT'D)                                   
                   We have to get inside the Mayflower                        
                   now.                                                       

      Anna steps out. She cannot conceal the sudden shiver that runs
      through her when she stands in front of the former hospital-

                               ANNA                                           
                   From now on, I'm going to close my                         
                   eyes.                                                      
                               (MORE)


                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               93.
121   CONTINUED:                                                  121
                               ANNA (CONT'D)
                   Take me to the basement, to the mirror
                   room. It has to stop where it began...                 

      Ben grabs her forcefully-

                               BEN                                        
                   Come on, let's go.

                               ANNA                                       
                   Mr. Carson, no matter what happens in                  
                   there, I want you to do as I say and
                   make sure I never get out of this
                   place.                                                 

      Ben pulls out his keys and unlocks the front door. Anna closes      
      her eyes and follows him inside.


122   INT. NIGHT - ENTRANCE HALL- MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE        122

      Anna has barely crossed the threshold when the hall mirrors
      start trembling-

      They can feel her presence.                                         

      She tightens her grip around Ben's hand. She is anxious, and
      even with her eyes shut, she can sense the threatening vibes
      sent off by the mirrors.

      Ben is focused, gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground
      floor in the direction of the basement door.

      Yet, from the corner of his eye, he cannot help but glimpse the
      mirrors. What he discovers goes beyond his worst nightmares-

      A CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN, FLAYED ALIVE, CRAWLING AND PRESSING       
      THEMSELVES AGAINST THE GLASS PANES, INSIDE THE MIRRORS. THEY
      OBSERVE BEN AND ANNA WITH BLANK, LIFELESS GAZES. SOME ARE
      BANGING THEIR FISTS, THEIR HANDS, AND EVEN THEIR HEADS AGAINST
      THE GLASS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK FREE FROM THE MIRROR.

      SUDDENLY BEHIND HIM, ONE OF THESE VISIONS BASHES AGAINST THE        
      MIRROR! KEEPING ITS WIDE OPENED EYES ON THEM, THE VISION STARTS     
      LICKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR LIKE AN ANIMAL.

                               ANNA
                   They are waiting for me...                             

      Ben turns towards Anna and realizes that in the mirror, there's     
      something else-                                                     

      Anna's reflection is different- IT'S NOT THE OLD NUN ANYMORE BUT    
      THE 12 YEARS OLD GIRL, EXACTLY AS ANNA WAS IN THE TIME OF ST.       
      JOHNS HOSPITAL!                                                     

                                                                94.




123   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                    123

      We are back in the house.

      Amy is still searching for Michael. She goes into the kitchen to      
      turn off the tap.

      Above the sink, the newspaper on the windows had been ripped as       
      well and the hot steam is now covering the glass. A HAND PRINT        
      APPEARS ON ONE OF THE WINDOW PANES AND SLIDES DOWN AGAINST THE        
      GLASS...                                                              

      The forces are everywhere.                                            

      Amy steps back and runs out of the kitchen.                           

      THE THIN LAYER OF WATER ON THE FLOOR HAS TRANSFORMED THE ENTIRE
      HOUSE INTO A MIRROR EXTENDING THROUGH EACH ROOM.

      AN INESCAPABLE MIRROR...

      The sound of rapid, splashing footsteps catches her attention.
      Amy turns around and leaves the kitchen-

                             AMY
                 Michael ?

      Michael's reflection sweeps over the water surface.

      Amy runs after him but stops short when she catches sight of
      him. Michael is hiding under the living room couch.                   

      She comes closer and bends over- THERE IS NO ONE UNDER THE            
      COUCH!                                                                

      Yet, in the reflection of the wet floor, Michael is there...          

      He smiles at her, playfully.

      IN A QUICK MOVEMENT, THE LITTLE BOY'S REFLECTION BRANDISHES THE
      KNIFE IN EXCITEMENT AND TEARS IT THROUGH HIS MOTHER'S FACE-

      AMY LETS OUT A CRY OF PAIN AS SHE BRINGS HER HAND TO HER CHEEK-
      THE INVISIBLE BLADE HAS SLASHED HER FACE.

      The blood gushes between her fingers. Michael's reflection has
      disappeared.

      She turns around just in time to catch sight of the little boy's
      reflection escaping. His invisible footsteps splash in the water
      as he moves further away...

      She hears Michael run up the stairs to the first floor.

                                                              95.




124   INT. NIGHT - STEP-IN CLOSET                                   124

      Protected from the mirrors, in her hiding place in the closet,
      Daisy inspects the room through the wooden slats.

      Suddenly, the bedroom door squeaks open. Daisy curls up in the
      corner of the closet, overtaken with fear-

      It's only the cat who enters the room with a meow.

                             DAISY
                 Tiger! Come here kitty, come here...

      She opens the door a tiny crack to let him in. The little girl      
      takes the pet in her arms, reassuringly.

125   INT. NIGHT -MAYFLOWER BASEMENT                                125

      In the dark, the surface of the water lies perfectly still. We
      are no longer in the New Jersey house, but in the subterranean
      passageways corridors of the department store.                      

      Ben and Anna's silhouettes appear, walking down the stairs.

      Ben turns on his flashlight. The lights along the corridor are      
      too weak.                                                           

                             BEN
                 Watch your step, a water pipe has
                 burst, the whole basement is flooded.                    

      Ben guides Anna, with her eyes still shut, through the tunnels.

      The beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls, and the
      piping.                                                             

      They pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the         
      demolished wall.                                                    

                             ANNA                                         
                 You stay outside...                                      

      Anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror
      room.

      IN ALL THE MIRRORS IT'S NOT ANNA THE NUN, BUT ANNA THE LITTLE       
      GIRL THAT WE CAN SEE-

      When she places her hand against one of the mirrors, cracks
      appear instantly. The pressure on the other side is growing
      stronger and stronger.

      Anna positions herself in the center of the room, from where her
      reflection is multiplied to infinity from all the possible
      angles.                                                            

      She kneels down with her eyes closed.

      Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store,     
      the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light.         

      Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. As Narcissus      
      did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of
      the water that covers the wooden floor.                            

                                AMY
                   Michael ?

      Hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his
      mother's call.

      Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him.

                                AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael... Michael, look at me... I'm
                   right here.

      Michael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in
      the surface of the water.

      Amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his
      reflection...

      She lays her hand on his shoulder.

      This time Michael reacts and turns towards her.

      Before he can utter a single word-                                 

      THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S      
      WRISTS. MICHAEL'S REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE.        
      MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR.

      Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too
      late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of
      water covering the floor. MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER
      SIDE OF THE MIRROR!

      Amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were
      caught under a coat of ice.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael, Michael... No, no...

      In desperation, Amy beats her fists against the floor with all
      her strength, trying to break through to the other side.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   MICHAEL !! NOOOOO...

      Flying into a rage, she beats her fists again and again in an
      attempt to break the surface and save Michael from drowning.

      She sees Michael's body sinking into the depths...

      Back to the subterranean world of the department store.

      Ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand.

      In the mirror room, Anna recites a prayer for strength. IN THE      
      REFLECTION, YOUNG ANNA IS DOING THE SAME...                         

      The mirrors around her shake more and more violently-

      Anna remains with her eyes still shut.                              

      Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the
      water at his feet trembling...


127A INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                        127A   

      SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE STORE AS WELL- ON EACH
      FLOOR, IN EVERY DEPARTMENT, ALL THE MIRRORS BEGIN TO VIBRATE
      UNCONTROLLABLY, TO TWIST OUT OF SHAPE, TO SWELL, TO SHRIVEL AND
      FINALLY-

      ANNA OPENS HER EYES-

      ALL THE MIRRORS EXPLODE!

      FROM ONE AREA TO THE NEXT IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE, THE
      EXPLOSIONS ARE SPECTACULAR AND APOCALYPTIC.

      Anna's eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards
      of glass are sent flying into the air, piercing through her body
      like a dozen sharpened daggers.

      The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble.
      Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall.

      MICHAEL'S BODY REEMERGES TO THE SURFACE!

      Amy clings to him and pulls him out of the water. The little boy
      is unconscious.

      She begins to shake him and to perform mouth-to-mouth
      resuscitation as she applies rhythmical pressure to his chest.

      Amy tries not to lose her head, determined to bring her little
      boy back to life.

      Her eyes fill with tears, blurring her vision. She mustn't lose
      faith. She mustn't give up...

      Cardiac massage, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, cardiac massage...

      MICHAEL REMAINS UNCONSCIOUS...                                         


129   INT. NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM / SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS              129

      IN THE BASEMENT, THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED.

      Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror
      room. In the silence, he waits. He must establish beyond a doubt
      that it's all over.

      He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-

      Everything seems to be back to normal. His reflection is
      deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming
      placid.

      Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-

      All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the           
      metal cage that was holding them in place. The floor is covered        
      with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water,
      shimmering in the shadows.

      The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or
      her dead body-

      Nothing...

      Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure -         
      The woman has vanished.

      He aims his flashlight at the ceiling. The beam of light
      instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-

      It's her, or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED,
      METAMORPHOSED, HUMAN FRAME. SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.


                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                               99.

      WITH HER EYES ROLLED UPWARD, HER SLASHED FACE AND HER BODY
      PIERCED BY THE SHARDS OF GLASS, SHE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON, DEPRIVED
      OF ANY HUMAN TRAITS. THE REAL ANNA DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOMENT     
      SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR.

      Ben has no time to react before "Anna" charges at him.

      He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as
      much as he can.

      HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC     
      CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST   
      AND THE WORST EPILEPTIC FIT.                                       

      Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "Anna" spits     
      blood in his face.

      He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of
      glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only
      seems to provide her an intense pleasure...

      "Anna" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,
      animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.

      In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away.

      Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a
      rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash
      violently against the brick walls...

      Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.

      Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
      underground passageways.

      On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He         
      strives to regain consciousness...

      Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but- 

      "Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a
      backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.

      She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into
      the wall.

      With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.     
      He cannot see his assailant...

      Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand           
      struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.

      Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs
      it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".

      The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.

      Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after       
      the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks
      off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.

      Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.

      He struggles to get back on his feet-                                 

      Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence
      surrounds the subterranean passageways.

      Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas      
      pipe.                                                                 

      With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-        
      Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have             
      replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to      
      the creature, no matter what happens.                                 

      He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,      
      towards what once was "Anna"...                                       

      Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.      
      Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The       
      creature thrusts itself against him-                                  

      THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to          
      keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.                               

      In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE       
      BROKEN GAS PIPE!                                                      

      IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER            
      STOMACH BUT-                                                          

      Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems                
      unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On       
      the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the          
      trap.                                                                 

      Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and        
      aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he       
      is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.                      

      The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.                        

      Ben stands by-                                                        

      The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires-

      THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. "ANNA" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
      THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS.

      Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames.

      SUDDENLY, IN A DOMINO EFFECT, ONE EXPLOSION FOLLOWS THE OTHER. A
      BLAST OCCURS A BIT FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL, AND ANOTHER INSIDE
      THE WALLS.

      THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE-

      Cracks appear everywhere. The brick walls begin to fall apart.

      A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in.

      Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs.

      Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's
      resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben.

      Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls
      collapse.

      Ben runs as fast as he can.

      "Anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly -

      JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING
      HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE.

      Ben narrowly escaped the collapse. He reaches the staircase and
      catches sight of the exit above when suddenly-

      THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM.

      Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the         
      mirroring water surface DISAPPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE        
      MIRROR.

      All of her efforts are in vain. Amy is unable to bring back her      
      son.                                                                 

      Nonetheless, she continues with the same determination, refusing     
      to accept reality.                                                   

      She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above...              


129B THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR                                  129B    

      Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben          
      turns and sees Michael's body/soul which is also trapped in this     
      parallel dimension, on the other side of the mirror.                 

      In the distance, he can see the surface leading to the hallway       
      of the New Jersey house. Above it, Amy tries to resuscitate          
      Michael.

      Ben grabs his son and holds him tightly in his arms for a          
      moment, then pushes him towards the surface-                       

      THE CHILD OPENS HIS EYES!-                                         


130   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                130    

      MICHAEL COMES AROUND, COUGHING OUT THE WATER FROM HIS LUNGS. Amy
      bursts into tears, sobbing with joy. She holds him tightly in
      her arms, with all her strength, with all her love.                

      Holding Michael in her arms, Amy comes back for Daisy in the
      bedroom. She opens the closet door and finds her little girl       
      inside. The child throws herself into her mother's arms-

                              DAISY
                  It is over, Mom?

      Amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror. Everything
      seems back to normal.

                              AMY
                  Yes sweetheart, it's over...

      Amy holds her two children tightly, savoring this moment of joy
      and relief.

      Through the window, we see the first light of dawn appearing on
      the horizon.


131   INT. DAWN - MAYFLOWER                                       131

      The sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome
      above the entrance hall of the department store.

      The pigeons fly in and out...

      The burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the
      ruins.

      ON THE WALLS, ALL THAT REMAINS FROM THE MIRRORS IS THEIR 1920's    
      GOLD FRAMES.

      The floor has completely subsided. It looks like there was just
      an earthquake under the building.

      In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble
      begins to move-

      A HAND APPEARS. SOMEBODY SURFACES -

      It's Ben. He gasps for air. Wounded and covered in dust, it is a   
      miracle that he has survived.

      He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of
      concrete to regain the ground floor.

      Limping, he crosses the entrance hall. His discovery of the
      absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He
      has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to
      be indestructible...


132   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                          132   

      Ben steps out of the department store, walks out of the closed      
      off area, and reaches the street.                                   

      Police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances with spinning lights       
      have surrounded the fencing.                                        

      Ben approaches the scene. He needs medical attention. He catches    
      sight of Lorenzo, talking to some policemen. Ben stops dead in      
      his tracks-                                                         

      THE NAME LORENZO, EMBROIDERED ON THE UNIFORM, IS WRITTEN            
      BACKWARDS...                                                        

      Ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates-        

      How is it possible? EVERYTHING IS REVERSED.                         

      Ben steps back in panic.                                            

      As he walks away from the scene we discover something else in       
      the back of the ambulance-                                          

      ANNA'S CHARRED CADAVER, THAT HAS BEEN DUG OUT OF THE RUBBLE.

133   EXT. DAY - TIME SQUARE                                        133   

      Ben walks up west 38th Street to Broadway and stops at the          
      intersection of the streets, paralyzed with fear-                   

      The activity of Time Square seems normal for an early morning,      
      cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the            
      pedestrians, but ALL THE SIGNS, ALL THE BILLBOARDS ARE REVERSED.    
      AND SO IS THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW...                      

      Ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless          
      person is sleeping-                                                 

      His eyes fill with horror-                                          

      HE CAN SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HOMELESS MAN BUT NOT HIS OWN..

      Ben presses his hand against the glass. The reflection of the        
      world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but      
      he remains invisible.                                                

      He removes his hand from the mirror, leaving a clear and well-       
      defined handprint on the reflective surface.                         

      Ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him -               

      IF HIS REFLECTION IS NOT THERE, IT MEANS THAT HE NO LONGER           
      BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING. BEN DID NOT SURVIVE-             

      HIS SOUL IS NOW A CAPTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR...

134   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                           134   

      Back in the ambulance, a paramedic comes to close the back door.     

      The vehicle starts and leaves the Mayflower.                         


135   EXT. DAY - NEW-YORK - CONTINUITY                               135   

      The ambulance turns on the avenue.                                   


136   INT. DAY - AMBULANCE - MOVING                                  136   

      In the back of the ambulance, as the vehicle drives away, we         
      discover that another corpse is laid out next to Anna's-             

      IT'S BEN'S BODY, COVERED WITH DUST AND DRY BLOOD.                    

      Its fingers suddenly twitch...                                       

      Was it the bumpy road?                                               

      The dead fingers twitch again and-                                   

      IN THE SHADOW, BEN'S CORPSE SLOWLY BEGINS TO STAND.                  

      It turns its head-                                                   

      BEN'S EYES ARE ROLLED UPWARD, NO LONGER HUMAN...                     

      EVIL.
